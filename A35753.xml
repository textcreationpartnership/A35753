            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Divine Epiſtle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> was not to reſt in their hands; but by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs order, to be communicated unto the neighbouring <hi>Laodiceans;</hi> as we read, in the Epiſtle it ſelf towards the end. It would therefore ſeem a little congruous, that theſe Sermons, which expound it, do undergoe a like diſpoſal; and not confined to the <hi>French,</hi> to whom they were originally Preached, be imparted to the neighbouring <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Author of them was He whom, his Auditors at <hi>Charenton</hi> did frequently call, for the beauty, and richneſs of his Diſcourſes, the Silver-tongue <hi>Daille;</hi> Readers here have applauded, and do eſteem highly, for his Apologie, and that exquiſite Treatiſe of the uſe of the Fathers; both which have for ſome years, ſpoke our Language; The learned all abroad do know him, and value him for divers other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent labours. He ſignalized himſelf, both at the Preſs, and in the Pulpit: and GOD was pleaſed, to crown him, in His ſervice, with the glory of a vigorous, and venerable old age.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, I was none of the meeteſt to repreſent this Work of his, and communicate it, as I do: nor did I deſign it at the entrance. But a private exerciſe receiving ſome encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
<pb facs="tcp:50919:3"/>grew up, and comes at length into a publication. Neither am I without hope; but that the known <hi>Engliſh</hi> civility for ſtrangers, will be ſhewed Mr. <hi>Daille;</hi> though his Interpreter be no more, then he is.</p>
                  <p>Yea, while that Reverend man interpreteth here a great Apoſtle; and preſſeth as he doth, ſolid religiouſneſs towards GOD, Loyal Subjection to Princes, and Superiours; Peace, and Love, and every Vertue among men; I would promiſe him Chriſtian attention, and conſideration; a calm and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous enduring of little diſcrepancies, if any occurr; and all the reſpect, that befits a Miniſter of CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, I deem it not improper, to put into Your hand, a piece, which had its Original in <hi>France;</hi> when I reflect upon the illuſtriouſneſs of Your Anceſtry ſometime there. I cannot but mind in particular, how the Family was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into the Royal Houſe it ſelf; <hi>Peter</hi> a Son of <hi>Louis le Gros,</hi> eſpouſing the Inheretrix, a Name, and Arms of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenay;</hi> ſo becoming the ſtock, whence thoſe Noble after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches iſſued, which did ſpread forth on this, and on that ſide of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>But the Dominion, and Empire of GOD is equally over all the Kinreds, and Kingdoms of the World; and unto Him, every one's greateſt, and neareſt relation. I tender there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preſent Volume, chiefly, as ſpent upon the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and enforcement of His holy mind and will: and do beſeech You, to accept the gratitude, which it is tendred withall.</p>
                  <p>That every Divine bleſſing may deſcend, and reſt upon Your Perſon, and Affairs, Your Vertuous Honourable Lady, and all thoſe ſweet Branches about Your Table, is the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and inceſſant Prayer of</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Preſent You theſe Sermons; believing, I owe this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, not only to the Friendſhip, wherewith you honour me: but much more to the edification, and good offices, the Church where I preached them, receiveth now a long time from your piety. For beſides the fair ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which your life giveth us, a life full of vertue, and honour; always conſtant, and equal in the profeſſion, and holy Exerciſes of the truth of the Goſpel: there hath been preſented no occaſion of doing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the people of GOD, either in the one, or in the other of their times, but you have embraced with zeal, and managed with prudence.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe we ſee, that the Good and Merciful LORD, you ſerve, hath crowned your obedience with the benedictions of His Grace. For in the inequality of ſeaſons, and the diverſity of affairs, He hath ſtill rendred You acceptable, both to thoſe within, and even to them without. And, which is the principal, He hath preſerved His Covenant in your houſe, that neither the vanity of the world, nor the ſcandal of the time, hath been able to make any of the breaches there, which we ſee with grief in other families. To eſtabliſh this pretious heritage of piety in your
<pb facs="tcp:50919:4"/>blood, His Providence hath added to it, by alliance, perſons excellent in knowledge, and in merit, in whoſe linage you daily ſee your own life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and flowriſh afreſh. It is true, Sir, you have alſo had your tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; as no true believers are exempted from them. But thoſe which GOD hath diſpenſed to you, have been ſo tempered with his goodneſs, as I believe you may truly ſay, that in this more, than in any other paſſage of Your life, He hath made ſhine forth the marveils of His grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards You. Such was, ſome years ago, the bitter, but bleſſed and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py death, of the late Sir Your eldeſt Son, taken away untimely, and in the prime flower, and vigor of His age. This was without doubt a very dolorous ſtroke, which cut down in a moment the ſweeteſt of your hopes, plucking from your embraces, a Son as love-worthy, as he was loved; and whoſe deſerving, to ſay all in a few words, was no leſs, than the dignity of a Senator, to which he was already arrived, in the chief of the Parliaments of this Kingdom. But how ſenſible ſoever His death was unto you, it was notwithſtanding accompanied with grace of GOD ſo viſible and raviſhing, as I fear not to refreſh Your memory of it; well knowing, it is no leſs dear, and pretious to You for the piety, and the high, and truly Chriſtian conſtancy, He ſhewed, in thoſe laſt, and happy moments of His life; than troubleſom, and bitter, for the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſadneſs, which it left on Your whole Houſe. As ſoon as His malady appeared to be, what indeed it was, He looked on Death without diſturbance; He prepared Himſelf for it, with great courage; and His air, his eyes, and all His diſcourſes, were full of reſolution, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. He comforted us all; and amid the tenderneſs, and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch a ſeparation, never expreſſed ought of feebleneſs. And though He left on earth, of the deareſt and ſweeteſt, one may here poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs or deſire; yet He quitted it, not only without regret, but even with joy; ſo firm was the hope, or to ſay better, ſo clear and aſſured the ſight, which the LORD JESUS then gave Him, of the bliſſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, to which He called him. He remained in this graceful, and holy diſpoſition, even to His laſt breath, with a ſpirit clear, and a ſoul calm, ſpeaking to us of His approaching happineſs; and of the preſent grace of His LORD; with ſo much efficacy, as it ſtopped Your tears, and in ſuch manner forced the reſentments of your grief, that how juſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were, You had nevertheleſs a ſecret ſhame, to make them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the preſence, and on the occaſion of ſo vertuous a perſon; as if Laments, and Plaints ſhould have in ſome ſort offended His piety, and diſhonored the victory of his faith. The ſame GOD, that looſed Him ſo miraculouſly from earth, to raiſe him up to heaven, granted You to ſupport the affection of His departure, with a patience worthy Your
<pb facs="tcp:50919:4"/>vocation. After ſo rude a blow, He hath yet ſuſtained You; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted You to an honourable old age, that few perſons do attain. And now I doubt not, but Your principal conſolation, and the agitations of the preſent world, and the infirmities of this age, is the aſſured hope you have, of arriving alſo one day at the port of that bleſſed immortality, where, contrary to the ordinary courſe of nature, You have ſeen this dear Son enter before You.</p>
                  <p>If in the holy exerciſes of Piety, by which You daily prepare You for it, the reading of theſe Sermons may find place, and be of any uſe for Your conſolation; I ſhall therein have extream ſatisfaction: at leaſt I can well aſſure You, it is one of my moſt ardent deſires; who pray GOD, to preſerve you, with all your Family, in perfect proſperity, and remain inviolably,</p>

For as Roſes, the faireſt, and ſweeteſt of Flowers, do grow on a rough, and thorny ſtock; ſo from the afflictions of the faithful, rugged and piercing to the fleſh, ſpring forth examples of their Vertue, and inſtances of their Piety; ſweeteſt and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50919:6"/>moſt ſalubrious productions. See, what a rich ſtore of benefits, the tryals of <hi>Job,</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> have yielded us! It's to them we owe, that admirable Book of the Patience of the former; and a good part of the Divine Hymns of the latter. Had it not been for their afflictions, we ſhould not now enjoy after ſo many Ages, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable treaſure of Inſtructions, and Conſolations. What ſhall I ſay of the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of St. <hi>Paul?</hi> which did ſpead the Goſpel all abroad, and convert the world unto knowledge of the true GOD. His impriſonment at <hi>Rome</hi> alone under the Empire of <hi>Nero,</hi> hath done the Church more good; than the peace, and proſperity of all the reſt of the faithful, that then were. It gave reputation to the Goſpel; and made it gloriouſly enter into the ſtatelieſt Court in the world. It inſpired an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick courage into Preachers of the truth. It awakened the curioſity of ſome; and inflamed the charity of others: and filled all that great City with the Name and Odor of JESUS CHRIST. Nor was it of uſe unto the <hi>Romans</hi> only. It imparted its celeſtial fruit, unto the remoteſt Regions, and Generations. For it was in this very confinement, that this holy man wrote ſeveral of his Divine Epiſtles, which we read with ſo much edification to this day: as thoſe to <hi>Philemon,</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> and that directed to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the Expoſition whereof we laſt finiſhed; and the following to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> which we have choſen to explain henceforth unto you, if GOD permit. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Priſon was a common receptacle, whence have iſſued out thoſe living Springs, which water, and rejoyce the City of GOD, and will furniſh it even to the end of the world with the ſtreams it needs for its refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>Having then already drawn from the one of theſe ſweet Springs, that Divine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, wherewith we have endeavoured, according to the Miniſtry committed to us of GOD, to irrorate the heavenly plants of your faith, and love; we now turn us, my Brethren, to the other; a no leſs quick, and plentiful one, than the former. Bring ye to it, as the Lord requires, ſouls thirſting for His grace; and He will give you, as He hath promiſed, living water, which ſhall quench your drougth for ever, and become in each of you a Well, ſpringing up to eternal life.</p>
                     <p>The Church of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to whom this Epiſtle is addreſſed, having been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily planted by <hi>Epaphras,</hi> a faithful Miniſter of CHRIST, the enemy failed not to ſow forthwith his Tares within it, by the hands of ſome Seducers, theſe men would mingle <hi>Moſes</hi> with our Saviour, and together with the Goſpel of the one, retain, and obſerve the Ceremonies of the other. To make their error the more pleaſing, they painted it over with colours of Philoſophy, ſubtility of Diſcourſe, curioſity of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and other ſuch like Artifices. <hi>Epaphras</hi> ſeeing the danger whereinto this prophane medly did caſt the faith, and ſalvation of his dear <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> advertiſeth St. <hi>Paul</hi> of it, then Priſoner at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Apoſtle, to withdraw them from ſo pernicious an error, taketh Pen in hand, and writeth them this Letter: wherein he ſheweth them, that in JESUS CHRIST alone, is all the fulneſs of our ſalvation; in ſuch manner, as that we ſhould deeply injure Him, to ſeek ought of it, out of Him; ſince in His Goſpel we have abundantly, wherewith to inform our Faith and form our manners, without adding thereto, either the ſhadows of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the vanities of Philoſophy. At the entrance He ſaluteth them, and congratulates them for the Communion they had with GOD in His Son. Next he draweth them a lively pourtrait of the Lord JESUS, wherein ſhine forth the dignity of His perſon, and the inexhauſtible abundance of His benefits. Upon that, he undertaketh the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, and refutes the unprofitable additions, wherewith they ſophiſticated the ſimplicity of the Goſpel. Afterwards, from diſpute he paſſeth unto exhortation; conjuring theſe faithful people to live well, and holy, forming their deportment to a Piety, Honeſty, and Vertue, worthy their vocation. He endeth with ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs, whereof he ſpeaketh to them, and with the recommendations he preſents them, both on his own part, and on the part of ſome other faithful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that were with Him. But you will better underſtand the whole, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of each of the parts of the Epiſtle; if the LORD grant us to compleat the ſame. For the preſent we propoſe to our ſelves, to conſider only the five Verſes we have read: the two firſt of which contain the Inſcription of the Epiſtle, and the other three the joy, and the thanksgivings of <hi>Paul</hi> unto GOD for the faith and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50919:6"/>charity of theſe <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> Theſe ſhall be (GOD willing) the two Points, that we will treat on in this action.</p>
                     <p>The Inſcription of the Epiſtle is couched in theſe words; <hi>Paul an Apoſtle of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST by the Will of GOD, and the Brother</hi> Timothy, <hi>to the Saints and faithful brethren in CHRIST JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, that are at</hi> Coloſſe. <hi>Grace be unto you, and peace from GOD our Father, and from the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> Whereas at this day the cuſtom is, to put <hi>upon</hi> Letters the name of thoſe, to whom they are written; and <hi>within,</hi> after the body of the Letter, the Name, and Sign of thoſe that write them; heretofore the uſe was otherwiſe: for he that wrote, did ſet both the one and the other Name <hi>within,</hi> at the head of the Letter, with a brief ſalutation in theſe words. <hi>Such a one, unto ſuch a one, health;</hi> as we learn by a multitude of Greek and Latin Epiſtles, which are left us in the ancient Books of the moſt renowned Perſonages of thoſe two Nations. The Apoſtle that lived in thoſe Ages, uſeth the ſame manner in all his Letters, as you know; ſaving, that inſtead of wiſhing health, and proſperity, to thoſe to whom he writes; He ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily wiſheth them <hi>Peace, and the Grace of GOD, and of his Son JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>According to this form, the inſcription of this Epiſtle containeth, Firſt, The Names, and Qualities, both of them that write it, and thoſe they write it to; and Secondly, The good, and happy wiſh, wherewith they ſalute them. The Names of thoſe that write it, are <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy;</hi> ſufficiently known to all, that are ever ſo little verſed, in the reading of the New Teſtament. They are here deſcribed, each by certain qualities attributed to them. To <hi>Paul,</hi> that of an <hi>Apoſtle of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, by the will of GOD.</hi> To <hi>Timothy,</hi> that of <hi>Brother</hi> ſimply. The word (<hi>Apoſtle</hi>) ſignifies in the Language of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> one deputed; a perſon ſent by ſome one. But in the Scripture of the New Covenant, it is taken particularly, for thoſe firſt, and higheſt Miniſters of the LORD JESUS, whom He ſent with a Soveraign and Independent Authority to Preach the Goſpel, and eſtabliſh His Church in the world. The higheſt and nobleſt charge GOD ever gave to men: And to exerciſe it, it was neceſſary, Firſt, To have ſeen JESUS CHRIST alive after His Death, that a good and lawful Teſtimony might be given of His Reſurrection. They muſt Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Have received their commiſſion from the LORD himſelf immediately; and in the Third place, Have the Holy Spirit in an extraordinary meaſure, with the gift of Tongues, and Miracles. Whence appears, how ill founded they are, that attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the glory of an Apoſtleſhip to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom none of thoſe three conditions do agree. It is alſo clear, that this dignity is extraordinary, and was not inſtituted but for the firſt eſtabliſhments of the Church: the government whereof after its plantation, the Apoſtles put in the hands of another kind of in feriour Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, which are indifferently called in Scripture, either Biſhops, that is, Overſeers, and Superintendents, or Presbyters, that is, Elders.</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> informeth us, that to the twelve Apoſtles afore ordained, our LORD added beſides, afterward, St. <hi>Paul:</hi> having miraculouſly appeared to Him, and ſent Him with the ſame power the reſt had, to convert the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> He aſſumeth therefore here this glorious Title, at the entrance of this Letter, and ſaith moreover, that He is an Apoſtle <hi>by the will of GOD:</hi> ſignifying, that it was the expreſs Order, and Mandate of the LORD, which honoured him with this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and not the ſuffrage, and authority of men; differencing Himſelf by this means, from thoſe falſe Teachers, and Troublers, that had not been ſent, but by the will of fleſh and blood. The declaration of this His quality was here neceſſary for Him: Firſt, To maintain His honour againſt the calumnies of Seducers, who did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparage, and black Him, as much as they could, under pretence that He had not lived as the other Apoſtles in the company of JESUS CHRIST, during the dayes of His fleſh; and Secondly, To ground the liberty He took of writing to the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> and of remonſtrating to them their duty, as well in faith, as manners; it being evident that the Apoſtles had right to uſe this authority over all, and every of the Chriſtian Churches. To His own Name he addeth that of <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Brother,</hi> as having one, and the ſame faith; and labouring about one, and the ſame work: whether it were to authorize His Doctrine the more, by the conſent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50919:7"/>of this holy man; every word being more firm in the mouth of two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, than in that of one alone: Or to recommend Him to theſe believers; that if he wrote to them, or ever came to viſit them, they might receive Him, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon worthy of the fellowſhip of the Apoſtles, and whoſe Name deſerved to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that of <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for thoſe to whom He directeth this Epiſtle, He deſcribes them next in theſe words. <hi>To the Saints and faithful Brethren in CHRIST that are at Coloſſe.</hi> I paſs by as childiſh and impertinent, the opinion of thoſe, whom it liſted to ſay, that it is the Iſle and City of <hi>Rhodes</hi> He meaneth; and that He calleth it <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> becauſe of that great, and prodigious Statue of the Sun, which the <hi>Rhodians</hi> had erected at the mouth of their Haven, and which the <hi>Greeks</hi> ordinarily called the <hi>Coloſſus.</hi> What need is there of theſe frigid, and ridiculous ſubtilities, ſince the Ancients ſhew, that there was yerſt in <hi>Phrygia</hi> a Province of <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſs, a City called <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> not far from two others, to wit, <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> whom the Apoſtle alſo mentions in this Epiſtle, and recommends expreſly to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> the communicating this Letter to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> when themſelves ſhould have read it. Afterward this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> changed its Name, and was called <hi>Cone,</hi> and to it one of the famouſeſt Writers of the latter times of <hi>Greece,</hi> who is called <hi>Nicetas Choniates</hi> owed his birth, taking His Surname from the place where he was born:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>In Th ſaur. l.</hi> 4. <hi>ch.</hi> 22.</note> and himſelf boaſteth in one of His Works, that it had been to the inhabitants of the City of <hi>Cone,</hi> whence he was, that the Apoſtle did the honour to write this Epiſtle.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> qualifieth the Chriſtians at <hi>Coloſſe</hi> Saints, and faithful Brethren. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them Saints, a name he ordinarily giveth to all true Chriſtians, and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to them indeed: foraſmuch as GOD, ſeparating them from the reſt of men by the effectual working of His Word, and by the Sacrament of His Baptiſm, cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and purifieth them from the filth of Sin, and delivereth them from the ſervitude of the fleſh, and conſecrates them to His own name and ſervice, to be to Him a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, addicted to good works. Whence it comes, that the whole body of the faithful is called in the Creed, <hi>The Holy Church.</hi> Mark this well, my Brethren, and make account, that you cannot be Chriſtians except you be truly Saints. Suffer not your ſelves to be abuſed by the deceitfulneſs of thoſe, who promiſe you this glorious Name, provided only you make profeſſion to believe in CHRIST, and that ye will live in the Communion of their Church, how naught and impious ſoever ye be other wayes; the body of the LORD is too lively and precious to have dead, and rotten members. I confeſs, if you have the induſtry to hide your Vices under the falſe appearances of an outward profeſſion, you will gain thus much; that men will give you the name of Chriſtians, and reckon you among the members of the Church; as it might well be, that among thoſe whom the Apoſtle honours here with the Name of Saints, and faithful, there were ſome hypocrites. But GOD who ſeeth the ſecrets of our hearts, and upon whoſe judgement our whole condition doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, will never count you Chriſtians, or members of his Son, if you be not truly Saints. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe, and the Church, who by a charitable judgement call you now Diſciples of the LORD, will change their opinion, and rank you with profane men, and worldlings, when they ſhall diſcover your Hypocrifie. The Title, <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> which the Apoſtle gives in the ſecond place to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> is common to all true Chriſtians too, and is taken from that Faith they give to the Goſpel of the LORD. The word, <hi>Brethren,</hi> that follows, ſignifieth the holy communion they had with the Apoſtle, and with all other believers of whatſoever quality, or condition they were: as perſons, all begotten of the ſame Father, namely, GOD: all born of the ſame Mother <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from on high; all partaking of the ſame Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; all nurſed in the ſame ſpiritual family; bred up in the ſame hopes; deſtined to the ſame inheritance; conſecrated by one and the ſame Diſcipline. In fine, He adds, <hi>in CHRIST;</hi> becauſe it is of Him, and by Him, and in Him, that we have all this Sanctity, Faith, and Fraternal union, the titles whereof he hath given to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After having thus denoted, and qualified the perſons, He writes unto; He wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, according to His cuſtom, <hi>Grace and Peace from GOD our Father, and from the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> By <hi>Grace,</hi> He meaneth the favour, and good will of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50919:7"/>GOD, with the ſaving gifts, and divine aſſiſtance, wherewith he gratifieth thoſe He loveth in His Son. By <hi>Peace,</hi> He ſignifieth that of GOD, which is nothing elſe, but the calm and tranquility of a ſoul, that looketh to the LORD with aſſurance, having remiſſion of its ſins by JESUS CHRIST, and is delivered by the effectual operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of His Spirit from the importune tyranny of the luſts of the fleſh. It may yet well be, that beſide this firſt and chiefeſt peace, the Apoſtle intendeth alſo that of men: a ſweet, and calm eſtate; exempt from their hatred and perſecutions: that they might without juſtling them, or being troubled of them, lead <hi>a peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> You ſhould alſo know, that in the ſtile of Scripture the word <hi>Peace,</hi> ſignifieth generally all kind of welfare, and proſperity: to which ſenſe, it may without inconvenience be interpreted in this place. But he wiſheth them theſe benefits <hi>From GOD our Father, and from our LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST. From GOD;</hi> becauſe He is the firſt and higheſt ſpring of all good: the <hi>Father of lights, from whom cometh down every good gift. From JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> for that He is as the channel, by which the benefits of GOD ſtream down upon us: it being clear that without the death and reſurrection, and in a word, without the mediation of JESUS, we could have had no part in the leaſt of the Graces of GOD. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth GOD <hi>our Father;</hi> becauſe He hath adopted us freely in His Son; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly upon this relation, that He communicateth His Grace, and Peace to us: whence it cometh, that JESUS CHRIST hath given us order to call Him <hi>our Father</hi> in the prayer He hath taught us. He calleth JESUS CHRIST the LORD, becauſe he is our Maſter, who hath all power and authority over us, as well by the right of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as by that of Redemption. Such is the Inſcription of this Epiſtle.</p>
                     <p>Let us come now to the ſecond point of our Text, wherein the Apoſtle congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulates the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> for the part they had in JESUS CHRIST. <hi>We give thanks</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to GOD for you, who is the Father of our LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, praying alwayes for you, having heard ſpeak of your faith in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, and of the charity you have towards all the Saints, for the hope that is reſerved for you in Heaven which you have before heard of, by the word of truth, to wit, the Goſpel.</hi> Here is, as the Preface, or <hi>Exordium</hi> of the Epiſtle, which extendeth as far as the thirteenth Verſe: wherein the Apoſtle, by the true praiſes he giveth the piety of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> winneth their benevolence; and declares to them His affection, to prepare them for a right, and faithful reception of the inſtructions, he will hereafter propoſe to them, as proceeding from a ſoul deſirous of their ſalvation. He proteſteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them, Firſt, In general, that as often as himſelf and <hi>Timothy</hi> prayed GOD for them, they did it with moſt humble thanksgivings, for the happy eſtate, wherein in Spirit they ſaw them. Next he toucheth more particularly the grounds of this thanksgiving, and propoſeth three of them. Firſt, The faith of the <hi>Coloſſians:</hi> Secondly, their charity, and in the third and laſt place, the inheritance reſerved in Heaven for them: Three particulars which comprize all the felicity of man. The part He taketh in the happineſs of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> teacheth us one of the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary offices of our charity, which is to intereſs our ſelves in the affairs of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; <hi>to mourn with them that mourn, to rejoyce with them that joy:</hi> and be as near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched with their good, and evil as our own. Far from our practice, be the envy and malignity of worldlings; to whom the proſperity of others giveth trouble, and their adverſity, gladneſs, who feed themſelves with their miſeries, and are ſad at their mercies. But the Apoſtle ſheweth us moreover by this his example, that the joy we have for the good of our neighbours, ſhould be elevated unto GOD, who is the only ſource thereof, to render Him thanks for it. This is the juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Tribute, this liberal LORD demandeth of us, for ſo many benefits, as he communicateth daily to our Brethren and our ſelves. If our lowneſs and poverty render us incapable of other acknowledgement, let us at leaſt faithfully acquit us of this ſo eaſie an one, and ſo rightful; and ſay with the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 116.12, 13.</note> 
                        <hi>What ſhall I render to the LORD? All his benefits are upon me. I will take the cup of deliverances, and call upon the Name of the Eternal One.</hi> Let us ſtudy with ſo much the more care to render this ſacred due to the LORD, by how much more black and deteſtable the ingratitude of men is in this behalf. Far from bleſſing Him for the benefits he doth their neighbours, they ſcarce give Him thanks for thoſe they receive of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50919:8"/>Him themſelves. They impute them to their own induſtry or fortune, and (as ſaith the Prophet) <hi>Sacrifice to their Drag;</hi> for the good ſucceſſes that betide them: yea, ſome ſo inſenſible there are, as it is not godlineſs it ſelf, but they give the glory of it to their own will, and the ſtrength of their free determination. But it is not enough to render thanks to GOD for our Brethren, there muſt be alſo prayer for them. For as it is He that gives them all the good things they poſſeſs: So there is none but himſelf that can preſerve or augment them to them: and thus our thanksgivings ſhould be ever followed or accompanied with Petitions: as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſheweth, in ſaying that <hi>be giveth thanks to GOD for the</hi> Coloſſians, <hi>praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for them.</hi> The Title He giveth to GOD, calling Him <hi>the Father of our LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> is not put here in vain; but to diſtinguiſh, and ſpecifie the object of our prayers, and thanksgivings. The appellation of GOD under the Old Teſtament was The GOD of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Patriarchs with whom He contracted the Old Covenant, and to whom He promiſed the New. Now, His Name is, <hi>the Father of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> by whom He hath aboliſhed the Old Teſtament, and accompliſhed the New. Beſides, hereby St. <hi>Paul</hi> remindeth us, of that we can never enough meditate: that it is by the mean of this ſweet and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Saviour, GOD hath communicated Himſelf to us; and if we have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be His children, 'tis by JESUS CHRIST, of whom He is properly the Father, having not adopted Him, as us: but begotten Him from all eternity, of His own ſubſtance; by reaſon whereof, that alſo which He aſſumed to Himſelf, in the Womb of the Virgin, hath the ſame glory; according to what the Angel ſaid, <hi>The Holy Spirit ſhall come upon thee</hi> (ſaid he to the Holy Virgin) <hi>and the Vertue of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 1 35.</note> 
                        <hi>whence alſo that holy thing that ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the Son of GOD.</hi> But the Apoſtle addeth in his proceſs, what were thoſe bleſſings of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> for which himſelf, and <hi>Timothy</hi> ſo aſſiduouſly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their thanks to GOD, the Father of our Saviour, <hi>Having heard ſpeak of your faith in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and of the charity you have towards all the Saints.</hi> He had never been among them; as He will ſay hereafter, putting them, after the opinion of moſt Interpreters,
<note place="margin">Col. 2.1.</note> in the number of thoſe, <hi>Who had not ſeen his preſence in the fleſh.</hi> Therefore he ſaith, it was by hearing, that he underſtood of their faith, and charity. Here is (faithful Sirs) the true matter of our joyings and thanksgivings for our neighbours; not that GOD hath given them vigour of health, abundance of riches, the favour of the great, the glory of fame, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Sciences, and ſuch other worldly good things; which, to ſay the truth, are but figures, dreams, and ſhadows, that ſecure no perſon (as we daily ſee) either from diſeaſes of the body, or death: or from trouble, and diſquiet of conſcience; or true miſery: But indeed for that Heaven hath revealed JESUS CHRIST to them, and ſhed into their ſouls, that <hi>holineſs, without which none ſhall ſee GOD.</hi> For theſe two Graces, Faith and Charity, comprize within their compaſs, the whole Kingdom of GOD. Faith is the entrance thereof, and charity the accompliſhment. The one cleareth our underſtandings; the other ſanctifieth our affections. The one is the light of the ſoul; the other is the heat thereof. The one believeth, and the other loveth. The one beginneth, and the other finiſheth the happineſs of our life.</p>
                     <p>Now Faith reſpects indeed generally the whole doctrine of GOD revealed in His Word, believing it undoubtedly true: but yet it fixeth particularly on the Promiſe He hath made us, to give us Eternal Life in JESUS CHRIST His Son. 'Tis this properly, that renders Faith ſaving, and vivifying. Without this, it would not differ at all from the faith of Devils, who believe there is a GOD, and tremble at it. But this love of GOD, which it apprehendeth, and embraceth, giveth it ſalvation; and enables it to produce in us, all that's neceſſary for getting in to the celeſtial Kingdom; according to the aſſertions of JESUS CHRIST and His Apoſtles in divers places of the Scripture, that <hi>whoſoever believeth in the LORD is already paſſed from death to life.</hi> That there is <hi>no condemnation</hi> for him; and that <hi>being juſtified by faith, we have peace with GOD.</hi> Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> to deſcribe here true faith, addeth expreſly theſe words, <hi>Faith in JE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> He ſheweth us in like manner the object of Charity, by ſaying, <hi>The Charity you have towards all the Saints:</hi>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50919:8"/>that is, as we have intimated afore, towards all Chriſtians, all the faithful.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs, that Charity extendeth it ſelf to all men generally: there being none, to whom we owe not love, and on occaſion the offices which a true, and ſincere affection is apt to produce: ſince all men are the Works, and Images of GOD: ſince in <hi>Adam</hi> they all have one common nature with us; and all are called to the participation of faith, and of eternity in JESUS CHRIST by the Goſpel, which, without diſtinction, or exception, inviteth all Nations, and perſons to repentance and grace. But ſo it is, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that Charity embraceth not all men equally. It hath divers degrees in it's affections; and loveth it's neighbours more or leſs, as it perceiveth more or leſs in them, the marks of the hand of GOD, and the tokens of His CHRIST, and Spirit. Seeing therefore, they appear no where more clearly, than in the Saints, that is, in true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, it is evident, theſe make the firſt, and principal part of the object of Charity;
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note> according to what the Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere; <hi>Let us do good to all: but principally to the houſhold of faith.</hi> Beſides that Union we have with them, a much more ſtrict, and intimate one, than with any others: their neceſſity alſo doth particularly oblige us thereto; the hatred and perſecution of the world, putting them for the moſt part in ſuch caſe, as none of Creatures do more need the offices of our Charity: neither is there any object worthier of the affection and ſuccour of a good and generous ſoul, than innocence hated and oppreſſed unjuſtly: therefore it is, that the Apoſtle noteth here by name the <hi>Charity</hi> of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> towards all the Saints.</p>
                     <p>He joyneth theſe two Vertues together, Faith, and Charity; becauſe in effect they are inſeparable: it being neither poſſible, nor imaginable (whatſoever error liſt to ſay of it) that man ſhould believe, and truly embrace GOD, as his Saviour in JESUS CHRIST, without loving Him, and His neighbours for His ſake: or that he ſhould love Him ſincerely, without believing in Him. He puts Faith before Charity, not for that it is more excellent (on the contrary, he elſewhere openly giveth the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto Charity) but becauſe it goes firſt in the order of things requiſite to ſalvation. It is the bleſſed root, whence Charity ſprings forth,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> and all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vertues. It is the foundation of the ſpiritual building; the Gate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; the firſt fruits of the workmanſhip of GOD, and the beginning of the ſecond Creation. As in the old Creation, Light was the firſt thing He created: ſo in the new one, Faith is the firſt thing He produceth; which the Apoſtle divinely expreſſeth to us elſewhere.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note> 
                        <hi>GOD</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of GOD in the face of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Faith, and Charity of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> the Apoſtle adds in the third place, the Happineſs that was kept for them in the Heavens. <hi>For the hope</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>which is reſerved in Heaven for you.</hi> Some knit theſe words, with what he had now ſaid of the Faith, and Charity of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and underſtand, that theſe faithful people laboured with alacrity in the exerciſe of theſe Vertues, for the hope they had of the celeſtial Crown and reward: according to what the Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere of <hi>Moſes;</hi> that <hi>He choſe rather to be afflicted with the People of GOD,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr.</note> 
                        <hi>than to enjoy for a little time the delights of ſin, and eſteemed the reproach of CHRIST greater riches than the treaſures of</hi> Aegypt; <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he had reſpect to the recompence.</hi> And he teacheth us in general of all thoſe that come to GOD, that they <hi>muſt believe that GOD is, and that He is a rewarder of them that ſeek him.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid. v. 6.</note> And from hence it followeth not at all, either that our works do merit the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; or that our affection is mercenary. If we ſhould not hope but for what we merit, our hopes would be very miſerable. But knowing that GOD is faithful, and conſtant, we hope with aſſurance for the bliſs, which He, of His meer grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth us; and the leſs we merit it, the more love we conceive towards GOD, who giveth it to us; and the more acknowledgement, and ſervice ought we to render Him for the ſame. And for this gratuitous ſalary, which He promiſeth us, we look not on it as a prey after which we hunt; and without which, we would have no love for the LORD: but as an excellent evidence of His infinite goodneſs; as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of His admirable liberality; that love of GOD which ſhines forth in it, is the thing pleaſeth and raviſheth us moſt of all: and which enflameth our faith, our zeal, and our affection to the ſervice of ſo good and amiable a LORD, though then we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50919:9"/>ſhould bind, what the Apoſtle ſaith, of the Charity of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> with the hope they had of the heavenly glory; there would be nothing in this, but what were conform to Evangelical Truth.</p>
                     <p>Yet it ſeems to me more ſimple, and fluent, to refer it to the third Verſe, where he ſaith, that <hi>He giveth thanks to GOD for the</hi> Coloſſians, <hi>having underſtood their faith, and charity; for the hope</hi> (He addeth now) <hi>which is reſerved in Heaven for you.</hi> For to conſider the condition of theſe believers on the earth, it ſeems, there was no great cauſe to congratulate them for their faith, and charity: the afflictions, which they drew on them, rendring them in appearance the moſt miſerable of men. But though the fleſh make this judgement of it, the Spirit, that ſeeth, above viſible things, the Crown of glory prepared for the faith and charity of the faithful, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them for the happieſt of all Creatures; congratulates them, and rendreth thanks to GOD for the ineſtimable treaſure he hath communicated to them. <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that your piety hath it's tryals, and exerciſes in this world. But I forbear not to bleſs the LORD affectionately, for that He hath given it to you. I know the bliſs, that is prepared for you on high in the Sanctuary of GOD.</hi> He takes the word <hi>(Hope)</hi> here, as often elſewhere, for the thing we hope for, to wit, the bleſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and glory of the world to come. I confeſs, we poſſeſs it not yet: for hope is the expectation of a good to come.
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23.</note> 
                        <hi>That we are ſaved,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is in hope: but hope that a man ſeeth is not hope: for what a man ſeeth why doth he yet hope for?</hi> But this good, though abſent and to come, is as aſſured to us, as if we had it already in our hands. The Apoſtle ſhews it, when he addeth, that <hi>this Hope is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Heaven for you.</hi> It is a treaſure which GOD hath ſet apart, having fully prepared it already, keeping it faithfully for us in His own boſome. Whence it is, that we make an aſſured account thereof; for He hath depoſited it in the hands of JESUS CHRIST <hi>in whom is hid our life, and immortality;</hi> ſo as if we make an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured account of things, which a man of probity, and honour keepeth in truſt for us; how much more certain ſhould we be, of the life, and glory to come, ſeeing GOD hath put it for us in the keeping of ſo faithful, and powerful a depoſitary? The place where this rich treaſure is kept depoſited for us, confirms yet more the hope, and excellency of it to us: for (ſaith the Apoſtle) it is reſerved for us, in <hi>the heavens.</hi> Fear not, ye Faithful. Your bliſs is not on earth, where the Thief ſteals, or infidelity and violence make ſpoil: where time it ſelf ruineth all things: where Crowns the beſt eſtabliſht, are ſubject to a thouſand, and a thouſand acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Yours is on high, in the Heavens, in the Sanctuary of eternity, lifted up above all the odd variations, and inconſtancies of humane things; where neither our changes, nor the cauſes that produce them, have any acceſs. But this ſame place ſheweth you beſides, the excellency, and perfection of the bliſs you hope for: inaſmuch as all celeſtial things are great, and magnificent. Weakneſs, poverty, and imperfection lodge here below: Heaven is the habitation of glory, and felicity.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Apoſtle toucheth briefly, in the laſt words of this Text, whence it is, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had conceived ſo high an hope: <hi>Of which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you have heard heretofore by the word of truth, to wit, the Goſpel.</hi> This Soveraign bliſs, which is reſerved for us in the Heavens, is ſo highly raiſed above nature, that neither ſubtility of ſenſe, nor vivacity of reaſon, nor even the light of the Law could diſcover it to us, much leſs give us the hope thereof.
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> 
                        <hi>That ſame JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed death, hath brought to light, life and immortality by the Goſpel.</hi> Before this, they were, either entirely unperceived; or imperfectly known and hoped for. It's therefore preciſely from the Goſpel, that we draw both the faith, and the hope of them. He calleth the Goſpel, <hi>the word of truth,</hi> not (as ſome will have it) becauſe it is the Word of JESUS CHRIST, who is <hi>the Truth, and the life:</hi> (for this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is more ſubtil, than ſolid) but becauſe it is the moſt excellent of all Verities; thoſe that are learned in the School of Nature, and of the Law, being mean, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable in compariſon of thoſe which the Goſpel doth diſcover to us. It may well be, that the Apoſtle would alſo ſecretly oppoſe the doctrine of the Goſpel, to thoſe of the ſeducers, which ſtill recommended ſhadows, and figures, as we ſhall hear in the following Chapter: whereas the Goſpel preſenteth us the ſubſtance, and the truth of things. And it ſeems to be in this ſenſe, that St. <hi>John</hi> after he had
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50919:9"/>ſaid, <hi>The Law was given by Moſes,</hi> addeth in form of oppoſition;
<note place="margin">John 1.17.</note> 
                        <hi>But grace and truth came by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> becauſe the Law had only dark lineaments, and ſhadows whereas the LORD JESUS brought us the lively image, the body, and the truth of celeſtial things. The Apoſtle remindeth the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that they had already heretofore heard this <hi>Word of truth:</hi> as it were to proteſt unto them, that he would promote no novelty among them; having no other deſign, but to confirm them more and more in the holy doctrine they had already received with faith from <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras,</hi> and other Miniſters of the <hi>LORD.</hi> See (well beloved Brethren) that we had to ſay to you, for the expoſition of this Text.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth, that we briefly touch at, for you, the principal points we ſhould ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it, as well for the inſtruction of our Faith, as the edification of our Charity, and the conſolation of our ſouls. As for Faith, 'tis for it's ſecurity that St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us at the entrance, He is an <hi>Apoſtle of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST by the will of GOD,</hi> advertiſing us by this quality, He aſſumeth, to receive no doctrine into our belief which hath not been annunciated by theſe great, and higheſt Miniſters of the LORD. Let us examine the Spirits; and admit only the word of the Apoſtles. If any one Evangelize, beyond what they have preached, let us hold him for an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema.</hi> We have their Scriptures. Let us aſſuredly believe all that we read in them. Let the doctrine, which appears not there, be ſuſpected to us: and praiſed be GOD, that according to this rule, we have baniſhed from our Religion, that which error, and ſuperſtition had thruſt into Chriſtianity. You know that the GOD, the CHRIST, the Heaven, the Worſhip and Sacraments we preach, have been given us by the Apoſtles of the LORD eſtabliſhed by the Will of GOD, and do appear throughout in their Goſpels and in their Epiſtles. Whereas the Mediators, whom our Adverſaries invocate, the High Prieſt they acknowledge, the Traditions they maintain, the Purgatory they fear, the greateſt part of the Sacraments they celebrate, the adoration of the Hoſt, the veneration of Images, and the voluntary Worſhips which they practiſe, are not found at all either in the Old or the New Teſtament. Let us therefore firmly retain our Religion, as inſtituted by the Will of GOD, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reject what is beyond it, as come of man, and not of the LORD; from the Earth, and not from Heaven. But it is not enough to make profeſſion of it: we muſt plant this doctrine in our hearts by a lively belief; in ſuch ſort, as we may be able to ſay with truth, That we have faith in JESUS CHRIST, and charity towards all the Saints.</p>
                     <p>We render thanks to GOD, with the Apoſtle, for that of His great mercies, He hath vouchſafed to communicate this treaſure of His Goſpel to us; and not in vain; ſince there are among us that have truly made their profit of theſe ſpiritual riches. But the life of the greater part renders them unworthy of the praiſe, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here giveth the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> For is this to have Faith in JESUS CHRIST; to ſerve Him ſo looſely, as we do? and teſtifie ſo little zeal for His glory? ſo little reſpect to His Commandments? ſo little belief of his documents? and ſo little affection for the intereſts of His Kingdom? As for Charity, I am aſhamed to ſpeak of it, ſo cooled is ours. For if we loved all the faithful, ſhould we leave the life of ſome of them, and the reputation of others, without ſuccour? Should we injure them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of defending them? Should we take away <hi>their</hi> ſubſtance, inſtead of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating to them our own? Should we black their honour, inſtead of preſerving it? Would their proſperity offend us? Would their miſeries content us? Faithful Sirs, remember, they are the Saints of GOD, His Children, and the Brethren of His CHRIST. Reſpect thoſe ſo ſacred names, and ſpare perſons, that have the honour to belong ſo nearly to your LORD. He will judge you by the treatment, you ſhall give them; and write on his account, the good and the evil, which they ſhall receive from your hands; recompenſing it, or puniſhing, in the very ſame manner, as if you had honoured, or violated Him in His own perſon. He will cut you off from His communion, if you do not carefully regard and practiſe theirs; and will never avouch you for His Children, if you acknowledge them not for your Brethren. And here alledge not to me, I beſeech you, that you have faith. I know well, that this divine light cannot be in ſouls which are cold, and deſtitute of Charity. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that this were poſſible; I tell you, and declare, that all your pretended faith,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50919:10"/>ſhould you have the higheſt degree thereof, that may be in the world, without charity would be but a ſhadow, an Idol, and an illuſion; and, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, a <hi>ſtinking carkaſs.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">James 2.26.</note> Do all you will: Have as much faith and knowledge as you pleaſe, if you have not charity, you are not a Chriſtian, you are but a falſe, and deceitful image of one. Charity is abſolutely neceſſary to the perfection of a Chriſtian. It is the badge of this holy Diſcipline; it is the honour, and the glory of it: and the Apoſtle as you ſee, ſets it down here among it's eſſential parts. Faith ſhall ceaſe in Heaven, when we ſhall ſee inſtead of believing. But charity ſhall remain for ever. Have then a good thing, ſo neceſſary for you. If you have it not hitherto, ask it of GOD in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly with prayers and tears, and quit Him not before you have obtained it. If you have it, thank Him for it, more than for all the goods of the Univerſe; and make account, that in giving you charity, He hath given you the Life, the Kingdom, and the Crown of Heaven. Exerciſe this precious gift continually; let there be none of your neighbours, without feeling of it; Do good to all. Communicate what you have received: the light of your knowledge to the ignorant, the ſuccour of your good offices, to the afflicted; the ſweetneſs of your patience, to enemies; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of your viſits, to the ſick; the aſſiſtance of your alms, to the needy; the example of your innocence to all, with whom you converſe. But have a particular care of Saints, the members of the LORD JESUS, who ſerve Him here with you, and how poor ſoever they be, have yet been redeemed with His blood, and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to His glory, as well as you. Dear Brethren, your labour ſhall not be in vain: Your charity ſhall bring forth it's fruits in their ſeaſon with a moſt abundant uſury. For terrene, and periſhing good things, which you ſhall have ſowed here below, you ſhall one day reap on high thoſe that are celeſtial and immortal: for a little bread, and a little money that you ſhall now give to JESUS CHRIST, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from His liberal hand the delights of Paradice, and the treaſures of eternity. This is the hope, which is reſerved for you, in the Heavens. It is not the word of weak, and vain men, that hath promiſed it to you: You have heard, by the Goſpel, the Word of Truth, which cannot lye. And as ſo magnificent an hope ſhould enflame our Charity; ſo ſhould it comfort our patience, and render it invincible, under the Croſs, to which the Name of CHRIST doth ſubject us. Conſider a little, what the men of the world do, and ſuffer for uncertain hopes, that whirl in the Air, flote on the Sea, and depend upon the Wind, and Fortune; to how many dangers they expoſe themſelves; to what travail, and diſquiet they condemn themſelves; Voluntarily paſſing nights, and dayes in a moſt laborious ſervitude, for an imaginary good, that neither yet is, nor perhaps ſhall ever be; and which, how happy ſoever the ſucceſs of their deſigns may be, they ſhall not enjoy at moſt, but during ſome years only. Chriſtian, ſhall it be ſaid, that you have leſs zeal for Heaven, than theſe people have for Earth? Their hope is doubtful: Yours is aſſured. Theirs dependeth on the will of men, and the inconſtancy of elements: Yours is in Heaven. Purſue then generouſly ſo high and glorious a deſign. And ſince your hope is in Heaven, have inceſſantly heart, affection, and thought there. Regard no more either fleſh, or earth; it is not here, your bliſs is. JESUS CHRIST hath ſeated it on high at the right hand of the Father, in the Palace of His holineſs. Let this excellent hope, ſweeten all the evil, you ſuffer here below. If you be not at eaſe here; if you be deſpiſed; if you have no part in the wealth, or honours of the world: think that in like manner, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it here, that JESUS CHRIST hath promiſed you the rewards of your piety. That Heaven which you ſee ſo conſtant, and immutable, keeps them faithfully for you. You ſhall there receive one day, the honour, the glory, and the dignities, you now breath after; not to poſſeſs them during ſome miſerable moneths, as worldlings enjoy their pretended riches, but eternally, with a perfect, and unſpeakable content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the bleſſed communion of Saints, of Angels, and of JESUS CHRIST, the Lord of the one and the others: To whom, with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, the only true GOD bleſſed for ever, be honour and glory to ages of ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>DEar Brethren; the Goſpel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, is the moſt excellent, and moſt admirable Doctrine, that was ever publiſhed in the Univerſe. It is the grand myſterie of GOD, the wiſdom of Angels, and men; the glory of Heaven, and the happineſs of the Earth. It is the only ſeed of immortality, the perfection of our nature, the light of our underſtandings, and the ſanctity of our affections. There is no Philoſophy, or other Diſcipline; but this alone, that is able to deliver us from the ſlavery of Devils, and make us Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the moſt High. It is this ſolely, that truly purifieth us from the filth of ſin; and clotheth us with a complete righteouſnes; that plucketh us out of the hands of death, and hell; and giveth us acceſs to the Throne of GOD, there to receive, of His bounty, life and ſupreme felicity. All other religions, invented, and followed by fleſh and blood, are wayes of perdition; diſciplines of errour, and vanity: that preſent themſelves to poor men in the thick darkneſs of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as thoſe ſeducing fires, that ſometimes abuſe Travellers during the obſcurity of the Night; leading them into the deeps of death, and eternal malediction. The Law it ſelf, though come from on high, is nevertheleſs, as much beneath the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Goſpel, as <hi>Sinai</hi> is beneath Heaven, and <hi>Moſes</hi> beneath JESUS CHRIST. The Law affrighteth Conſciences; the Goſpel aſſureth them. The one ſlayeth the ſinner; the other raiſeth Him up again. The one maketh grace be deſired; the other makes it be enjoyed. The one preſented the ſhadows, and figures of the truth; the other giveth us the lively image, and very body thereof. Whence you may judge, my Brethren, how much it concerneth us to know, ſo ſaving and Divine a Doctrine that we may embrace, and obey it: ſince the repoſe, and happineſs of our ſouls ſtand on it, which we ſhall unprofitably ſeek any other where. It is to enflame us with an ardent deſire of this holy and bleſſed knowledge, that the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> propoſeth to us ſo often in His Epiſtles, the praiſes of the Goſpel; ſcarce ever naming it, without adding preſently ſomething to its commendation; as the cuſtome is of thoſe that love ardently, never to ſpeak of that they love, without giving it ſome Elogy, that teſtifies, both its excellency, and their paſſion. Such is the manner of Our St. <hi>Paul,</hi> towards the Goſpel of his Maſter. He hath his ſoul ſo full of the love, and admiration of this Heavenly doctrine, that He can neither pronounce, nor write the name of it, but He accompanies it with praiſes, as the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50919:11"/>juſt and due marks of its dignity. We have an example of it, in the Text, which you even now heard. For having ſaid afore, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had heard of the hope, which is laid up for us in the Heavens, by the word of truth, to wit; the Goſpel; from thence he takes occaſion, to interpoſe in this verſe, ſomething to its commendation: repreſenting to us, the extention, and efficacy of this Divine word of life. <hi>The Goſpel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which is come unto you as alſo it is into all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth alſo in you, ſince the day that you heard, and knew the Grace of God in truth.</hi> In the two verſes, that follow, he praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who had by his Miniſtry converted the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to the knowledge of the LORD, giving him an excellent teſtimony of fidelity, and goodneſs, and mingling therewith ſome praiſes of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> themſelves. <hi>As alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you have heard of</hi> Epaphras <hi>our dear fellow ſervant who is a faithful Miniſter of CHRIST for you, who alſo hath declared unto us your Charity which you have in the Spirit.</hi> This ſhall be (if it pleaſe the LORD) the matter of this action; And to proceed upon it in order, we will conſider, one after the other, the two particulars that preſent themſelves, as you ſee, in the Text of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> to wit, the praiſe of the Goſpel in the former verſe, and that of <hi>Epaphras</hi> in the two next: touching at <hi>alſo</hi> upon each, what the Apoſtle intermixeth to the commendation of the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> he toucheth at two points. Firſt, its admirable progreſs; and its great, and ſudden ſpread. <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>come unto you, as alſo into all the world;</hi> and ſecondly, its divine effectualneſs to convert men, and change their manners and life. <hi>And it bringeth forth fruit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as alſo it doth in you ſince the day that you heard and knew the Grace of GOD in truth.</hi> He ſaith therefore, firſt, That the Goſpel was come to the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> ſecondly, That it is alſo come unto all the World. About the firſt there is no difficulty: For ſince there was a Church in the City of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> it is evident, that the Goſpel, by which Chriſtian Churches are founded and builded, had been Preached to them. Only we ſhould obſerve in this event, the marvels of the goodneſs of GOD towards the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> For they were a barbarous, and an Idolatrous people; very far off from the Countrey, and the Religion of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> a portion of <hi>Phrygia</hi> a Province infamous for its abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; from whence had iſſued the myſteries, and infernal devotions of <hi>Cibele,</hi> called by the Gentiles, the mother of the GODs; the moſt deteſtable of all Pagan Idols; and in whoſe ſervice were committed the moſt unclean, and ſhamefulleſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. The <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> as other inhabitants of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> were plunged in this gulf of vileneſs, when the LORD vouchſafed to viſit them, and make the light of His Goſpel to ariſe upon them. Whence appears, that the knowledge He gives us of His word, is a preſent from His meer grace, and not the pay of our pretended merits. For what had the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> in the condition they then were, that might invite Him to communicate this rich treaſure to them? what had they on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but might have diverted Him from it; ſeeing all among them was full of a profound, and inveterate Idolatrouſneſs? You ſee alſo, the Apoſtle ſaith, not, that they were come to the Goſpel: but that the Goſpel was come to them; to ſhew us, that it is GOD that cometh to us, who preventeth us by His grace, according to the determinate purpoſe of His good pleaſure. The ſick do go, or ſend to the Phyſician, and ſollicite the ſuccour of his art. Here, quite contrary, the ſupream Phyſitian of ſouls, ſeeketh to the ſick. He comes to them in His benignity. He ſendeth them His Miniſters, and preſenteth to them His remedies, when they dream of nothing leſs,
<note place="margin">Luk. 19.10.</note> than of their malady, and the cure neceſſary for them. <hi>The Son of man came to ſeek, and ſave, that which was loſt.</hi> He diſpatcheth His ſervants to <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> and elſewhere, to bear thither His ſalvation, to people, that thought not, <hi>ſave of deſtroying themſelves.</hi> He makes Himſelf be found of them that ſought Him not;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 65.11.</note> and ſaith unto a Nation, that was not called by His Name, Behold me, behold me. Let a man ſearch, as much as he pleaſeth; He ſhall never be able to find any reaſonable cauſe of this diſpenſation of GOD, communicating His Goſpel at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, and to certain places; but His ſole good pleaſure. And that we might the better note this truth, He often directeth the light of His word to thoſe, that governed themſelves worſt in the ſtate of nature; and hideth it from them, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50919:11"/>ſeemed leſs defiled than others. He imparteth His Goſpel to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and ſuch like, the moſt loſt men that were, in all kind of ſuperſtitions, and Vices. He ſaith nothing to the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> or the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> or to divers others as well <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as <hi>Greeks,</hi> which were eſteemed at that time the moſt innocent of all mankind: as in effect there appeareth much more of juſtice, and honeſty in what is reported to us of their manners, than in thoſe of any other people. Wherefore hath GOD taken this courſe? Becauſe if He had done otherwiſe, if He had called only thoſe, in whoſe policy and life, was ſeen ſome outward goodneſs to ſhine forth; paſſing by thoſe whoſe manners had nothing which was not damnable; we ſhould have believed, without all doubt, what ſome cannot yet forbear to ſay, that it is the works of men that oblige GOD to call them, and to impart His Goſpel to them: and that if in rigour, they be not worthy of this favour; they merit it at leaſt in a ſeemlineſs of equity, and in congruity; as they ſpeak of it in the Schools of <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore the LORD uſeth very often a clean contrary procedure; to make us underſtand; that thoſe whom He calleth, do not, more than thoſe he leaveth, merit ought at all; (as in effect it is moſt true, that all men in the corruption, wherein they are born, do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is of value: the moſt ſplendid of their pretended vertues in this eſtate being but a plaiſter, and a deceitful dawbing, which under a fair appearance, hideth only deformity, and filth) and that if He vouchſafe to illuminate any, with the light of his Goſpel, it is of the ſole good pleaſure of His grace, He doth it, and not at all for merit of theirs. It was therefore a miracle of the Divine goodneſs, that this ſaving Doctrine came to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> who by their nature, were ſo far from it: and the Apoſtle remindeth them of it, to animate them more, and more, in ſincere grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, towards the author of ſo great a benefit.</p>
                     <p>But that which he addeth is much more ſtrange, and incredible; that the Goſpel was come into all the world. He teſtifieth it too elſewhere; as here a little after, where he ſaith, that the Goſpel is preached to every creature,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.23.</note> that is under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and at the tenth of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where applying to the Miniſters of the LORD JESUS what the Pſalmiſt had ſung of the Heavens;
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.18.</note> 
                        <hi>Their ſound,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is gone forth through all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the World.</hi> And elſewhere ſpeaking of himſelf, he ſaith, That from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 15.19.</note> and round about it, even to <hi>Illyricum</hi> he had made the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST to abound: and after the time, he wrote thoſe words, He ſowed it beſides in the Iſle of <hi>Malta,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> Now if the other twelve Apoſtles, and the ſeventy Diſciples, and the Evangeliſts did labour, each according to his meaſure, in proportion with St. <hi>Paul;</hi> as it is not to be doubted, but they did; no one will have cauſe to be aſtoniſhed; that all they together ſhould have, by that time, carryed the Goſpel through the whole world. We read likewiſe in the writings of the firſt Chriſtians, <hi>Juſtin, Clement, Tertullian,</hi> and others, that in their time, that is, about 130 and 160 years only after the LORD's death, all was full of Chriſtian Churches: and that there was no Nation either among the Greeks, or the Barbarians, nay the very Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians or Tartarians, wherein CHRIST JESUS had not ſervants. And though theſe teſtimonies cannot be rejected without extream impudence; there being no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that either St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or thoſe other Writers would have ſpoken of the thing in ſuch ſort, if it had not been true: yet entirely to diſarm incredulity, I will add, that the very ſame appears by the Books of Pagans of that time, that are remaining. For <hi>Tacitus,</hi> a Roman Hiſtorian, a paſſionate enemy of Chriſtianity,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Amel. l.</hi> 15.</note> though otherwiſe a grave man, and of great eſteem among his Countrymen, hath left in Writing, that in the eleventh year of <hi>Nero,</hi> that is, only eight years after the date of this Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> a ſevere ſearch having been made after it, there was found a very great multitude of Chriſtians at <hi>Rome.</hi> This ſufficeth to juſtifie what the Apoſtle ſays. For ſince that Preaching was able to penetrate ſo far on this ſide, athwart Provinces, that made, as it were, the heart of the Roman Empire; it might be much more eaſily ſpread towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in the Eſtates of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and in the <hi>Indies,</hi> even whither St. <hi>Thomas</hi> went, as appears, by tracks of it that remain of it to this day in thoſe Countries; and towards the <hi>South</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> where St. <hi>Matthew</hi> Preached, as the ancients do report; and towards the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50919:12"/>North, whither paſſed ſome of the other Diſciples. This was well nigh the whole world, then known of the Greeks, and Romans; and thus without doubt, the Apoſtle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it in this place. For as to thoſe great Countreys diſcovered in the Weſt, about one hundred and fifty years ago; which they commonly call the Weſt Indies, or the New world; it is evident, the Ancients had no certain knowledge of them; and it is very likely, that they were not yet peopled in the Apoſtle's time; the furtherſt memory, which the Nations there have preſerved, of things yerſt done among them, being but for four or five hundred years at moſt. Be it concluded therefore, that taking the World, as is commonly underſtood, for Countries inhabited, and known at that time, the Goſpel was then already come into all the world.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle mentions it to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Firſt to confirm them the more, in the ſaith they had given to the Goſpel. I confeſs, that its truth depends not upon the ſucceſs of the Preaching it; nor upon the multitude of them that believe it. Though all the world ſhould reject it; though Heaven and Earth ſhould perſecute it, the faith of a Chriſtian ought to abide alwayes firm, and unſhaken; being founded, as it is, upon the word of GOD, and not upon the conſent of men: as on the contrary, though the whole univerſe ſhould maintain errour, we ſhould not be for this, either obliged to follow errour, or excuſable for having followed it; this order of GOD ſubſiſting for ever, that we muſt not follow a multitude to do evil. But thoug it be thus, yet it is a great conſolation to a faithful ſoul, to ſee the truth ſpread abroad. And ſince the Divine Vertue of the LORD is ſo much the more powerfully declared, by how much the more men it converteth unto his Chriſt; it is evident, that this extenſion of the Goſpel helpeth, and confirmeth our Faith; in as much as it furniſheth us with an excellent teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the power of GOD, and of the efficacy of His word. But I add alſo, that the ſucceſs here touched by the Apoſtle, contains a manifeſt argument of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Goſpel; and that in two reſpects. For firſt, if you conſider the thing in its ſelf, it is ſo great, and marvelous, as that it ſheweth ſufficiently, that this Doctrine is not only true, but even Divine, and Celeſtial. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Letter, it was not full thirty years that JESUS CHRIST had ſuffered death in <hi>Judea,</hi> and yet the Goſpel (as he ſaith) was already come into all the world. How could it have made ſo much way in ſo little time; penetrated ſo many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, flown into ſo many places infinitely diſtant; if it had not been, both of a Celeſtial Original, and carryed by a divine force? Certainly, as the extenſion of the light of the Sun, who inlightens the whole Hemiſphere in an inſtant, and the rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its motion, who viſits all the Climats of the univerſe in four and twenty hours, doth evidently ſhew us, that it is a work of GOD, and of a nature altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different, from that of Earthly, and Elementary things; In like manner, this ſo ſwift, and ſuddain courſe of the Evangelique Doctrine, that fill'd the world in ſo little time, pierced through, and diſſipated the darkneſs, and made it ſelf be ſeen ſo quickly from one end of the Heavens to the other, invincibly proves, that it is a divine thing, and no humane production. Look on all the diſciplines, that ever had ſway in the World. You ſhall not find any of them, that was eſtabliſht in this ſort, and made ſuch a progreſs in ſo ſmall a time. The religions of the Pagans lived only in the Countries where they were born; and if ſometimes they ſtretched further, it was rather the curioſity of ſtrangers, that brought them from the place of their birth, than their own deſign, or vigour; all thoſe ſo famous ſects of the Philoſophy of the Greeks, did abide each of them in the ſoil that bare them. And the Doctrine, which the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have eſtabliſhed in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, came not to the eſtate, wherein we ſee it; but by a long ſucceſſion of time, one age gaining one point, and another adding a ſecond, till after many ages it took, in fine, the conſiſtence and form it hath at this day, and wherein it is maintained, by the terrour of Inquiſitions, and the pomp of a worldly power, and the favour of the Great, who find their own intereſts in it. It is only the Goſpel of the LORD, that from its birth, had the courage, and the force to fly every way, penetrating with incredible ſwiftneſs, all the Regions of the habitable world in leſs than five and twenty years. And let none alledge unto me here, the Seduction of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which infected the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the <hi>South,</hi> and a part of the <hi>Weſt</hi> it ſelf
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50919:12"/>in a very little time. For there is nothing alike in the progreſs of the one, and the other of theſe two doctrines. I paſs by other differences, that may be obſerved. I will only touch at one of the moſt eſſential: namely, that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours advanced not their impoſtures but by force of Arms and dint of Sword: not Preaching, and eſtabliſhing their Doctrine, ſave in the Countreys they conquer'd, and among the Nations they brought under their Yoke. To ſay true, it was their Iron, and not their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that ran through, and ſpoiled the World. What was ſtrange, or ſupernatural in their ſucceſs? That a Troop of Robbers, whom their own need, or others cowardice, and confuſion emboldened to enterpriſe, could ſeize them of ſome Towns by fraud or force? That puffed up with the good fortune of their firſt ſucceſſes, and by a multitude of people joyned with them, they puſhed further on, and iſſuing out of their <hi>Arabia</hi> ſhould attempt the outmoſt quarters of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, very ill-garded at that time, and in a manner, expoſed to pillage? and that gaining ground by little and little they ſhould fall on further, and break in on one ſide, and the other, as the diviſion, and weakneſs of their enemies gave them opportunity? ſo as, in fine, in the ſpace of three or four ſcore years they ſaw, by theſe progreſſes, the Eaſt, and the South in their hands? Sure there was nothing but humane in all this. <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> had yer-while done as much, or more in leſs than fifteen years; and <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> and divers others, both before, and after him. It is then no Miracle, that the Religion of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> born (if I may ſo ſay) upon the wings of their victorious Enſignes, ſaw much of the World, by this means, in fifty, or ſixty years: If any marvel be, it is that of their armes, which did ſo great exploits in ſo ſmall time, and not that of their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which never entred but into places, whoſe gates fire and ſword opened for it. But as to the Goſpel of the LORD JESUS it is quite otherwiſe, It had not to ſuſtain it, and advance it in the world, either the aid of force, or the favour of armes, or the ſucceſſes of Warr, or the exploits of any Conquerour. It had not in its ſervice, either the charms of Eloquence, or the ſubtilities of Philoſophy; in one word, it had no humane or terrene ſuccour, that you can poſſibly imagine. Thoſe that carryed it, were twelve, or thirteen Fiſhermen, with a little number of others of the ſame Cloth; without Credit, without Armes, without courage, without Experience: the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring, and ſweepage of the world; weakneſs, and imbecillity it ſelf: who far from enterpriſing upon ought of other mens, had renounced all that was their own: who inſtead of ſmiting, and ſlaying; where whip'd and ſton'd at every turn; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of attaquing, did not ſo much as make reſiſtance to them that ill handled them; living in an extreme humility and innocence. With this poor equipage the Goſpel undertook the world, and though it met every where with gates ſhut up, and walls garriſon'd with all that was terrible, to force it back; though the Jews perſecuted it, the gentiles derided it, great, and ſmall had it in abomination; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates baniſh'd it, and put it under the moſt cruel puniſhments; though all did rend it with injuries and reproaches; yet naked, as it was, it made it ſelf room; and in ſpight of ſo many dreadful impediments, ran from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> and from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North;</hi> and ſo conſtantly deſpiſed all earthly means, as it reigned every where for ſixcore years, before it had one Magiſtrate, or Captain on its ſide; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming and deſpoiling them, when it received any; ſo far was it from making ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their arms, or authority. We may affirm therefore that this progreſs of the Goſpel is a thing altogether ſingular, not at any time elſe ſeen, or hapning in the world; and with which neither Mahumetiſm, nor any other Religion hath any community. Conſequently, that this is a mark of the truth and divinity of this holy doctrine; thoſe that are humane, neither having, nor being able to have that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable force, and vertue, which appeareth in it.</p>
                     <p>But this event proves the ſame thing yet again, after another manner; inaſmuch as it was a manifeſt accompliſhment of ancient Oracles, yer-while given by the LORD to His former people, and regiſtred in His Scriptures; which foretell in divers places, that the Meſſiah ſhould ſpread all abroad, the knowledge of the true GOD, which was before ſhut up, within the ſtrait limits of <hi>Judea;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 60.3. &amp; 9.1.</note> that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions one day ſhould walk in His light, and that people ſitting in darkneſs ſhould ſee a great light, which the LORD JESUS explaining, in the dayes of His fleſh,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50919:13"/>had ſaid upon it,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24.14.</note> that His Goſpel ſhould be Preached in all the world. Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions therefore appearing at that time, ſo punctually, and ſo admirably, and in ſo ſhort a ſpace fulfilled, who can doubt any more, but that the LORD JESUS is the true CHRIST; ſince never any, but He, revealed the GOD of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and His ſervice to the World? and that His Apoſtles were the ſervants of this ſame GOD; who, having foretold theſe things, ſo many ages before; ſo mightily executed them by their Miniſtry, in the fulneſs of time?</p>
                     <p>But beſides the confirmation of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> faith in general; I account, that the Apoſtle would more-over, by this Elogy he gives the Goſpel, to be come into all the world, fortifie them in particular, againſt the new doctrines, which ſome ſeducers were ſowing in their Church. For ſince other Churches founded here, and their, in divers parts of the world, had heard nothing of them, it was a very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument, that they were not any part of the Goſpel, that is, of what the Apoſtles Preached. Whence we may draw, to give you this advice by the way, an invincible proof, both of the truth of the doctrine, we believe; and of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that, which we conteſt about, with our adverſaries of <hi>Rome.</hi> For as to that we hold, it is evident, the Apoſtles Preached it in all the world, both by word of mouth, and by writing; there being none of the neceſſary, poſitive, and aſſirmative articles of our faith, but doth appear in all the Monuments of Apoſtolique Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to wit, both in the Books they wrote, and in the Churches they ſounded. As for our adverſaries, it is no leſs evident, they can never ſhew, that the Monarchy, or infallibility of their Pope, or the Adoration of their Hoſt, or the ſervice of their Images, or their invocation of Saints, or Purgatory, or the trafick of their Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, or any other of the points which we debate with them, was Preached in all the world at the time of the holy Apoſtle; no track at all of them being found in any of the Books or Memorials that remain of that age, or of a long time beyond it: only a man may perceive them, ſome ages after, growing up, one in one place and another in another, at divers times, and in different Climats; an evident ſign, that they are, not parts of the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST which was Preached entire in all the world, in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> life time; but inventions and traditions of men, that came ſince.</p>
                     <p>After this ſuddain, and admirable ſpreading of the Goſpel, the Apoſtle adds the efficacy, it had in the places, where it had been preached. It is not only come into all the world (ſaith he) but which is more, it bringeth forth fruit there, as it doth alſo in you. It bears the ſame fruits there, which it hath produced among you. You diſcern, that theſe fruits of the Goſpel ſignifie no other thing, but that faith, charity, honeſty, modeſty, temperance, and the other ſpiritual vertues which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth in the ſouls of thoſe, that hear it, and receive it, as they ought, and in which the Sanctification of men doth conſiſt. It is this power, and efficacy of the Goſpel, which the LORD would repreſent unto us, in the Parable of the ſeed, to which He compareth it;
<note place="margin">Matt. 13.</note> and which according to the divers diſpoſition of the places where it fell, brought forth more, or leſs fruit; in ſome an bundred fold, in other fixty, and elſewhere but thirty. Never was ſeen a thing more marvellous. The Goſpel changed the whole earth in a few years. It crowned plants, with flowers, and fruits, that were barren, and accurſed. It filled the deſarts, the plains, and the moſt deſolate heaths, with exquiſit, and delicious trees. That which the Laws of Nations, that which the moſt excellent Philoſophy had husbanded, whole ages in vain, no ſooner felt the hand of theſe Evangelique Vine-dreſſers, and labourers, but ſuddainly loſing the bitterneſs of its firſt juice, was ſweetned, and became loaden with Celeſtial fruits. There was piety, ſweetneſs and humanity ſeen to flouriſh, where never had appeared ought, but the horrour of Superſtition, of Atheiſm, of cruelty, and all other kind of Vices. This is the change, which the LORD had foretold in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 41.19.</note> in thoſe Allegorical words, <hi>I will make to grow in the Deſart, the Cedar, the Pine tree, the Myrtle, and the Olive. I will ſet in the Plains, the Firre-tree, the Elme, and the Box together.</hi> And elſewhere again, comparing the Goſpel to a rain, that watereth the Earth, and makes it bud, and bring forth corn, and bread. So ſhall my word be (ſaith He) it ſhall not return to me without effect:
<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.10, 11.</note> but it ſhall do all my pleaſure, and proſper to the things, I ſhall ſend it for. And this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50919:13"/>divine fruitfulneſs of the doctrine of the Goſpel, which miraculouſly changed the world, is alſo a moſt evident argument of it's truth, and of it's heavenly original: there never having been Religion or Diſcipline, on earth, that had ſo lively, and univerſal an efficacy.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle particularly commendeth here the fruits it had brought forth among the <hi>Coloſſians. It fructifieth in you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſince the day, that you heard, and knew the grace of GOD in truth.</hi> He praiſeth, both their teachableneſs, in that this word had fructified in them, from the firſt day they heard it, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, for that it continued ſtill fructifying to that time. The earth produceth not fruit, as ſoon as it hath received the ſeed: there muſt be time to mollifie the grain, to make it thruſt forth, and ſprout; to raiſe it up, and garniſh it with fruits. In this ſpiritual Husbandry, it is not ſo. The Goſpel, if rightly received into your heart, will fructifie there, from that very moment. Receive it then, faithful Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Defer not till the morrow. This day, that you hear the voice of the LORD, <hi>harden not your hearts.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſalm 95.</note> It's one of the moſt pernicious artifices of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to ſuggeſt to men, that they put off their converſion to the future. Give me (ſaith He) this day, and thou ſhalt give God the next. Give me the preſent, and Him the future: to me the flower, and vigour of thy life; to Him the remains, and thine old age. So they find at laſt, when all hath been given to Satan, and the world, nothing remains for them to give the LORD: to whom they have left the future only, that is, what was not theirs: diſpoſing of the preſent, which alone was in their power, to the pleaſure of their mortal enemy. Chriſtians, take heed of his wiles, and haſten ye out of his ſnares. Imitate theſe faithful <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> Receive the Word of GOD ſo deep into your hearts, that it may fructifie there from this very day. You cannot be the LORD'S too ſoon. Put not off the deſign of being happy to another time: conſider, that time fleeth, and life runs out, and death comes, while you deliberate. But if we muſt begin betimes, to bear fruit, worthy of the Goſpel: it is not mean't, that we may ceaſe again ſoon after, as forward Trees, which make an end firſt, as they did begin. The plants of the LORD begin early, but never ceaſe to fructifie. They bring forth fruit in their through-white old age; and are even then in good liking; and bide freſh, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſingeth.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 92.15.</note> If you have embraced the Goſpel with ardour, retain it with an invincible conſtancy. For ſalvation is not prepared, ſave for them that ſhall perſevere; that ſhall keep the verdure of the heavenly ſap in them, in ſpight of the ſcorching heats of Summer, and the coolings of Winter, ſo as no ſeaſon, how rude, and contrary ſoever, doth ever ſtrip them of their myſtical flowers, and fruits. As to what remains, the Apoſtle calleth the faith of the Goſpel, <hi>The knowledge of the grace of GOD;</hi> becauſe it is not poſſible to reliſh this heavenly doctrine, if a man have not received, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the mercy, which it offereth us in JESUS CHRIST. This grace is the heart, and ſubſtance of the Goſpel. Whence appears, that it is a corrupting it, and a changing the nature of it, to thruſt into it the doctrine of the ſatisfactions, and merits of men; things, either wholly incompatible with Grace; or ſuch as at leaſt extreamly darken, and enfeeble it. When he faith, that they heard, <hi>and knew the Grace of GOD in truth,</hi> he meaneth, either that they received it truly, in ſincerity of heart, without hypocriſie; or that this Grace they knew was delivered them pure and ſincere, without any mixture, either of Phariſaical Superſtition, or Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vanity: or, finally, ſo, as it is declared in the Goſpel; not in Error, and in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Lies, as in falſe Religions; nor in ſhadow, and in figure, as in the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> but nakedly, and ſimply, as it is in it ſelf; Of theſe three Expoſitions, all good, and convenient: the Firſt is to the praiſe of the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> the Second to that of <hi>Epaphras</hi> their Paſtor; and the third to the praiſe of the Goſpel it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But as to <hi>Epaphras,</hi> he ſpeaks of Him by name in the two laſt Verſes of this Text, which make the ſecond part of it. And to commend Him to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and win him their hearts, and reſpect; He gives an excellent teſtimony, of his fidelity, his candour, and his goodneſs. <hi>As alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you have learned of</hi> Epaphras <hi>our dear fellow-ſervant, who is a faithful Miniſter of CHRIST for you, who alſo hath declared unto us your charity, which you have in the Spirit.</hi> This holy Apoſtle knew how
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50919:14"/>much it concerneth Churches, for their edification, to have a good opinion of their Paſtors; and with what artifices the enemy laboureth ordinarily to decry the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants of GOD, and ruine their reputation, among their flocks: therefore it is, that he here exalteth <hi>Epaphras,</hi> as his piety deſerved: and to take out of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians</hi> all ſuſpicion againſt the purity of his teachings, advertiſeth them expreſly, that the doctrine, they had learned of him, was in truth the ſame Goſpel, of which he had ſpoken. And from this great care, the Apoſtle hath of <hi>Epaphras</hi>'s reputation, the Miniſters of the LORD ſhould learn, to ſet themſelves, the beſt they can, in the Spirit of their people, abſtaining not from evil only, but alſo from its appearances, and whatſoever might make them to be ſuſpected of it. It is not enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the goodneſs of our life to our own conſcience; We muſt alſo, if it may be, content the judgement of our neighbours. Innocence is neceſſary for our ſelves, and reputation for others. And ſince it ſerves to edifie them, we are evidently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to preſerve, not our own only, but alſo the reputation of our fellow-brethren, whom GOD hath ſetled in the ſame charge; for if we bite, and rend one another; who ſees not, but the particular reproach of each one, will be the common infamy, and ruine of us all? But ſince the reputation of Paſtors is a publick good, which tendeth to the edification of the whole Church; you ſee again, that each faithful perſon oweth it a particular reſpect; and that the crime of thoſe who violate it unjuſtly is a kind of Sacriledge. It's a robbing of the Church, and ſtealing from it, it's edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to black by calumny, and detractions, the life, and doctrine of them that ſerve it: or to expoſe them to laughter and contempt, by ſcoffings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings.</p>
                     <p>But to return to <hi>Epaphras;</hi> the Apoſtle crowneth him with two, or three excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Elogies. Firſt, He calleth him <hi>his dear fellow-ſervant.</hi> Admire, I beſeech you, the candour, and the goodneſs, the humility, and the modeſty of this holy man. His candor; for whereas, ordinarily there's jealouſie between perſons of the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; St. <hi>Paul</hi> contrarily acknowledgeth, and exalteth the Gifts, and Vertue of this ſervant of GOD. His <hi>goodneſs;</hi> for He tenderly loves Him: as every where elſe, He plainly ſheweth, that of all men there were none he more affected, than the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel. His <hi>humility,</hi> laſtly; in that being raiſed on the Throne of the Apoſtolick dignity the higheſt in the Church, he maketh <hi>Epaphras,</hi> as one may ſay, to ſit there with Him; owning Him for His fellow. Next He termeth Him a <hi>Miniſter of CHRIST.</hi> It was much to be fellow-ſervant with St. <hi>Paul:</hi> but it is much more, to be the Miniſter of CHRIST, the LORD of glory, the Head of the Church, the Soveraign Monarch of Men and Angels. Judge, with what reaſon ſome of our adverſaries mock at the title we aſſume, qualifying our ſelves Miniſters of CHRIST, or of His Goſpel, ſince it is the word, that the Apoſtle uſeth here expreſly, to ſignifie that holy charge, which GOD hath called us unto. But He doth not term <hi>Epaphras</hi> ſimply a <hi>Miniſter of CHRIST;</hi> He ſaith moreover, that He is a <hi>faithful Miniſter:</hi> the quality of Miniſter was common to him with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; the praiſe of faithfulneſs, with few. 'Tis all that the Apoſtle did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in a good Steward of the Houſe of GOD.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Let each one hold us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for Miniſters of CHRIST, and Stewards of the myſteries of GOD. Moreover it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Stewards, that each one be found faithful.</hi> To have the praiſe thereof, the Miniſter of the LORD muſt, Firſt, Seek the glory of his Maſter, and not his own: and Secondly, Keep cloſe to His Orders; without hiding from, or envying to His Sheep, any of the things committed to him for their edification; without ſetting before them ought of His own invention, beyond, or againſt the will of the chief Shepheard. But though all theſe good qualities greatly recommended <hi>Epaphras</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> He addeth yet another, which, no leſs than the reſt, obliged them, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to love, and cheriſh him; namely, that He employed the Maſter's talents to their edification. <hi>He is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a faithful Miniſter of CHRIST for you.</hi> They ought therefore to love him, both for the dignity of his Office, and for the profit, that came in to them thereby. For though we be obliged to love, and reſpect all the faithful ſervants of GOD in general; yet there is no doubt, but we owe a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affection, and reverence to thoſe, who peculiarly conſecrate their Miniſtry to our edification. In fine, the Apoſtle tells them, that this holy ſervant of GOD,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50919:14"/>had advertiſed Him of the pure, and ſpiritual love they bore Him. <hi>He hath declared to us</hi> (ſaith he, that is, both to Him, and to <hi>Timothy) your charity which you have in Spirit.</hi> I count, that by charity, he meaneth here, not in general, the Chriſtian Vertue which we ordinarily call by this name; (for of the Charity of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> ſo underſtood, he had already ſpoken in the fourth Verſe) but the affection theſe faithful people had for St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And He calleth it a <hi>Charity,</hi> or <hi>Love in Spirit,</hi> that is, ſpiritual; becauſe it was founded upon the Spirit, and not upon the fleſh; upon the intereſts of Heaven, and not of Earth. And here, conſider, I beſeech you, how dextrous, and induſtrious <hi>Epaphras</hi> was to knit ſpiritual friendſhips. The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians</hi> had never ſeen St. <hi>Paul;</hi> 'tis he without doubt that had recounted to them the excellent vertue, and piety of this great man, and by this means enkindled in their ſouls that holy, and ſpiritual charity, they had for Him. And ſee again, how by the relation he makes to the Apoſtle, of the love theſe believers bore Him, He poſſeſſeth His ſoul with a reciprocal affection towards them. O holy, and bleſſed tongue, that ſoweſt nothing in the hearts of the faithful, but charity, and love; how far now-adayes from thy candour, and ſincere goodneſs, are thoſe mouths of Hell, that inſpire nothing but hatred, and kindle nothing but animoſity, envy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, in the ſouls of thoſe, whom they can breath upon; who buſie themſelves in making diſſentions among brethren; in dividing, and arming one againſt the other, ſuch, as nature, or grace hath moſt ſtrictly united!</p>
                     <p>But it is time henceforth to conclude this action: that which you have heard, may, I think, ſuffice for your underſtanding of this Text: and ſo nothing remains for me; but to conjure you to make in good earneſt your profit of it; and to draw from this Meditation the holy uſes it containeth, whether for the correction of your manners, or the conſolation of your ſouls. The Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST is come unto you; the ſame Goſpel, which yerwhile changed the Univerſe, which aboliſhed Idolatry, and Paganiſm, and made the knowledge, and ſervice of the true GOD flouriſh every where. The LORD hath raiſed you up <hi>Epaphras</hi>'s, faithful Miniſters of His Word, who have publiſhed it to your Fathers, and to you, with exquiſite ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and truth, entirely ſo, as <hi>Paul</hi> preached it to the Nations, without any leaven of ſuperſtition, or error; acquitting themſelves in their Stewardſhip with ſo upright a conſcience, with ſo much zeal, and ardour, as I aſſure my ſelf, that the great Apoſtle, were he now on earth, would do them the honour, to own them for his dear fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourers. You have ſeen, this ſacred doctrine renew the proofs of its divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by the ſwiftneſs of it's courſe, and efficacy of its vertue: as which, in little time, flew through all <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and in ſpight of the oppoſitions of Hell and Earth, rais'd up every where fair, and flouriſhing Churches to the LORD. We may ſay particularly of yours, that the Goſpel fructified in it, from the day it was heard there. The blood, and the ſufferings of ſo many faithful ones, as gloriouſly ſealed its truth therewith; their charity, their zeal, their good and holy works, of which, memory remaineth ſtill among us, are unreproachable witneſs of it. But I know not, whether I may juſtly add, what the Apoſtle ſaith here of his <hi>Coloſſians, that the Goſpel bringeth forth fruit ſtill in you.</hi> For thoſe few fruits, which it produceth here, are choaked up with ſo many thorns, and bryars, ſo many ſins, and vices; that they ſcarce deſerve to be conſidered. Not that the Goſpel is changed in its ſelf. It hath ſtill that immortal force, which GOD gave it; to bud, and thruſt forth, and produce the fruits of righteouſneſs and life. It is ever the incorruptible ſeed of GOD, His Word living, and abiding for ever; full of efficacy, and vigour. Whence then cometh this ſterility? Dear Brethren, it cometh from the bad diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ground, and not from the weakneſs of the heavenly ſeed. The Goſpel fructifieth not among us; becauſe it falls in ſtony places; and by the High-ways, or among thorns; upon ſouls, either full of worldly luſts, and carnal cares; or expoſed to the feet, to the going to and fro of Devils; or frozen up, and hardned with the fear of temporal evils. This is, Faithful Sirs, the true cauſe of our barrenneſs.</p>
                     <p>Let us then <hi>purge our hearts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hoſ. 10 12, Jer. 4.3.</note> and (as a Prophet ſaith) <hi>break up our fallow grounds.</hi> Let us pluck up the thorns, which the world hath planted there, avarice, the deſire, and deceitfulneſs of riches, ambition, and the love of our fleſh, ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and vanity. When you ſhall receive the Goſpel into ſouls, ſo prepared, it will
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50919:15"/>not fail to ſhew it's fecundity: It will bring forth it's fruit abundantly, in ſome an hundred for one, in others ſixty, in others thirty. Without this it is in vain, that we boaſt us of JESUS CHRIST, and of His Word: His Word is not given us, but to fructifie. If we abide barren; far from ſerving us, it will aggravate our condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and draw upon us a judgement ſo much the more terrible, by how much the more plentifully it was communicated to us. Remember that dreadful threatning, juſtified by ſo many ſad, and lamentable experiments, which the Apoſtle denounced to the <hi>Hebrews, The earth that bringeth forth thorns, and thiſtles, is rejected and nigh unto curſing, and it's end is to be burned. 'Tis a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living GOD;</hi> who is ſo much the more ſevere to puniſh the contempt of His Word, by how much the more liberal He was, in imparting it to men. Theſe ſame <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> whoſe faith and charity the Apoſtle praiſeth here; and their neighbours the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> for not having continued to bear fruits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy their Vocation, ſaw ſome years after their Cities ruined, and ſwallowed up in an horrible earthquake. And all thoſe fair Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſo much celebrated in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> are at this day entirely deſolate; for not having made their profit of the Goſpel. GOD hath already begun too, to avenge this contempt of His Word, in divers places of <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi> which the bryars, and thorns of the old ſuperſtition do cover once again, inſtead of the Goſpel, that lately flouriſhed there. GOD forbid, Dear Brethren, that we ſhould fall into the like condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To prevent it, let us recover the zeal of our Fathers; let us do the <hi>firſt works.</hi> Let the Goſpel fructifie again in the midſt of us. Let it bring forth, and make to grow up abundantly, charity, meekneſs, honeſty, peace, humility, patience, alms, prayer, faſting, ſobriety, chaſtity, and the other fruits of the Spirit; and above all, a ſpiritual love of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apoſtles, who report the Goſpel to us, to reſpect them, and walk in their doctrine, concord, and mutual love in one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another. If we make this uſe of it, GOD will take pleaſure in the midſt of us. He will daily viſit us; He will cheriſh us, as His Paradice, His Heritage, the Garden of His delights. He will pour out upon us here below all kind of graces and bleſſings in abundance; and after having ſeen us fructifie on Earth, He will one day tranſplant us into Heaven, to live, and flouriſh there for ever, in the Courts of His own bleſſed, and eternal habitation. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>THE love of beauty and excellency is ſo natural to us, that we cannot diſcover ſo much as the beginnings, and buddings of it any where, but we take pleaſure in them; and the ſecret content we thence receive, uſually cauſeth us to wiſh their growth, and their perfection; unleſs envy, or ſome other maligne paſſion, do check the moving of our hearts. Thus when we ſee towardly Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that promiſe well; there is no ſoul, that hath ever ſo little of humanity, but is delighted, and maketh the like apprecation for them, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did ſometime for <hi>Benjamin,</hi> when his Brethren preſented him; <hi>GOD be gracious unto thee, my Son.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 43.29.</note> From ſuch ſentiments do flow thoſe benedictions, which we are wont to pronounce upon perſons that are imployed in things beneficial, and uſeful, whether natural or civil: as, to inſtance with the <hi>Pſalmiſt;</hi> when we ſee the buſie Reapers of a fair Field in Harveſt time, and ſay, <hi>The bleſſing of the LORD be upon you;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 129.8.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>But if this kind of natural beauty, and perfection doth engage our affections, and good wiſhes to the ſubjects in which we perceive it: the gifts of divine grace, which are incomparably more excellent, ſhould much more lively touch us, my Brethren; and kindle in our hearts greater flames of love, and of deſire, for thoſe that poſſeſs them. For as high as Heaven is above the Earth, and as much as eternity is prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to time, ſo much advantage have the beauties, and perfections of Grace above thoſe of Nature. If therefore we judge rightly of them, and eſtimate them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their worth; it cannot be, that we ſhould ſee them ſhine out in any, without running to them, and faſtning forthwith on them, as holy, and as happy perſons. An eminent example of this motion of Chriſtian Charity, we have in our Text; for the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſheweth us, he no ſooner underſtood by <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras</hi>'s report, the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> faith, and love, but his ſoul was preſently ſeized with ardent love unto them; and his abſence hindring him from giving them other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of it, he inceſſantly preſented prayer, and earneſt ſuits to GOD, for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering, and perfiting in piety; that is, for the continuation, and the perpetuity of their happineſs</p>
                     <p>The ſumm of his deſires for them, is contained in three Verſes, as they evidently relate to three ſorts of benefits: for he wiſheth them firſt in the ninth Verſe, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that reſpect perfect knowledge of the truth, next in the tenth, thoſe that reſpect the exerciſe of ſanctity, and finally in the eleventh ſuch as concern perſeverance in faith, and patience in afflictions. For preſent, we will meditate only on the firſt of theſe three Articles, remitting the two next to another action. <hi>And for this cauſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we alſo ſince the day we heard it, ceaſe not to pray for you,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50919:16"/>and to crave, that ye might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtanding.</hi> For right underſtanding this Text, we will conſider in it three particulars, by the help of the grace of GOD, which we implore for this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Firſt, The Motive of the Apoſtle's prayers: Secondly, Their form, manner, and quality: and in fine, which is principal, and moſt important, the ſubject of them, that is, what He requeſted of GOD in His prayers.</p>
                     <p>As for the Motive, that induced the Apoſtle to pray for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> He ſignifies it to us, in theſe firſt words; <hi>And for this cauſe, ſince the day we heard it, we ceaſe not to pray for you.</hi> For theſe words ſending us back to the precedent Verſes, with which they have a tye, do ſhew us, that the knowledge, which the Apoſtle had by <hi>Epaphras</hi>'s relation, of the faith of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> towards JESUS CHRIST, and of their charity towards the Saints, of their heavenly hope, and of their other ſpiritual graces, whereof He ſpake afore, that this knowledge, I ſay, having filled Him with love towards them, made Him continually pour out His Vows, and prayers before GOD, for the compleating of their ſalvation. I confeſs, the affection they bore Him in particular, and whereof He maketh mention, in the Verſe immediately preceding, contributed ſomething alſo to this care he had to pray for them. But it's principal cauſe was their piety, and ſanctification; that they had the firſt fruits of the Spirit, and the beginnings of the Kingdom of Heaven. Seeing the foundations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and of the building of GOD, ſo happily laid, and eſtabliſhed among them, He beſeecheth the Supream Maſter, and Architect of this ſpiritual work, to finiſh it, and powerfully ſet the laſt hand to it. The ſame reaſon made Him in like manner, preſent His prayers to GOD for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> as he teſtifies, at the beginning of the Epiſtle,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.15, 16, 17.</note> he wrote them, uſing almoſt all the ſame words, that ſerve Him here. <hi>Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (ſaith he to them) <hi>heard of the faith, you have in the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, and the charity you have towards all the Saints; I ceaſe not to render thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that the GOD of our LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST the Father of glory, would give you the Spirit of Wiſdom, and of Revelation.</hi> Faithful Sirs, learn by this example of the Apoſtle, to pray the LORD principally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> thoſe, in whom you ſee the work of His Spirit appear. Rejoyce ye for their faith, and their zeal, and love them for the honeſty, and purity of their life: But remember, that the firſt, and principal office which your charity oweth them, is the continual ſuccour of your prayers. Object not, that they are too far advanced to need them. During the courſe of this life, the progreſs of a Chriſtian is never ſo great; but the prayers of his Brethren are neceſſary for him. It's then, when he is moſt advanced, that the enemy maketh moſt attempts, and layeth moſt ambuſhments for him. The nearer he is to the Crown, the more need he hath of divine aſſiſtance. As there is none in the liſts, whom we favour more with our wiſhes, acclamations, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes, than thoſe that come neareſt to victory: ſo in this carrier of the Goſpel, we ſhould affectionate, and accompany with our vows, prayers, and benedictions thoſe moſt, that run beſt; and are nigheſt to the mark of the heavenly calling. We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make more wiſhes for a Veſſel, than when after a long, and dangerous voyage, it comes upon our Coaſt, or we ſee it ready to arrive in the Haven. When the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, having eſcaped the ſhelves, and tempeſts of the world, ſteers the true courſe of Heaven, and makes (if we may ſo ſay) with Oars, and Sails to the Port of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; 'tis then we ſhould redouble our wiſhes, and benedictions for his ſafety; 'tis then we ſhould fear more than ever, leſt ſome miſhap marr all his progreſs, and bereave him of the reward of his pains. But let us now conſider the manner, and the quality of the Apoſtle's prayers; <hi>Since the day</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we heard</hi> theſe good news, <hi>we ceaſe not to pray GOD, and to make requeſt for you.</hi> Firſt, He did not pray alone. <hi>We</hi> ceaſe not to pray, ſaith he; where you ſee, he ſpeaks of more praying with him, compriſing in this number <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom he had expreſly named already, at the beginning of this Epiſtle; and the other faithful, that were at <hi>Rome</hi> with him. Being put on by one and the ſame charity, animated with one and the ſame deſire, they all lifted up their hearts, and Votes to GOD, together with the Apoſtle, for the ſpiritual proſperity of the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> As there is nothing on earth more grateful to the LORD, than this divine conſort of many ſouls, thus mingling their voices, and ſupplications together; ſo there is nothing more effectual to draw
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50919:16"/>down His bleſſing, and obtain His graces, in the behalf of our neighbours.

                        <hi>If two of you agree on earth concerning any thing they ſhall ask</hi> (ſaith our LORD) <hi>it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But beſide that the Apoſtle's prayers were conjoyned with thoſe of ſome other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that prayed unanimouſly with him for the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> they had alſo two other qualities, which gave them much force; aſſiduity, and the devotion of heart, whence they did iſſue. He expreſſeth the aſſiduity of them, when he ſaith, that <hi>he ceaſeth not to pray for them, ſince the day he heard of their piety, of their zeal in the Goſpel.</hi> As ſoon as he received the news of it, he deferred not this duty to another time. He ſet himſelf on praying preſently for them, demanding of GOD, the compleating of their faith; ſo ardently did this holy ſoul affect, all that bore the badges of his LORD. But he contented not himſelf, with praying once or twice for the ſalvation of theſe dear Diſciples of his Maſter. He went on conſtantly, and ceaſed not ſtill to ſollicite the goodneſs of GOD for them. For it is not enough, that <hi>Moſes</hi> do lift up his hands once, or twice for <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s victory. To defeat <hi>Amalek</hi> entirely, this holy man muſt hold his hands ſtill ſtretched out towards Heaven. Whence it comes, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> commandeth <hi>the Gards of Jeruſalem,</hi> that is, it's Paſtors,
<note place="margin">Iſaiah.</note> 
                        <hi>not to hold their peace, nor give the LORD any reſt, until He re-eſtabliſh, and ſet</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>in an eſtate of renown on the earth.</hi> And our Soveraign Maſter teacheth us expreſly, in one of His Evangelical Parables, that <hi>we ought alwayes to pray, and not faint.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 18.1. Col. 4.2. Rom. 12.12. 1 Theſſ. 5.17.</note> And His Apoſtle enjoyneth us here beneath, <hi>to perſevere in prayer,</hi> and elſewhere alſo, <hi>to continue inſtant in prayer:</hi> and again in another place, <hi>to pray without ceaſing.</hi> So you ſee, he very carefully practiſed himſelf, what he commanded others. Think not under ſhadow of this, that this holy man was on his knees from Morning to Evening, without addicting himſelf to ought, but the reciting of prayers; as was the uſe of a certain Sect of Hereticks in time paſt, named the <hi>Meſſalians,</hi> or <hi>Euchites,</hi> noted, and condemned by the ancient Church; who made profeſſion of being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in prayer, and under this fair mask did hide a moſt profound, and infamous lazineſs: As the greater part of the Monks of the Communion of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day; who in the Cloyſters, whither they retire, as in ſo many refuges of idleneſs, paſs their time in ſaying Litanies, and Oriſons, moſt commonly without any attention, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, under pretext of this vain ſervice, which they pretend to do the publick, drawing unjuſtly the Tribute of huge Alms, due of right to the true poor, and not to them, that are ſo, only of their own will, by a Vow directly contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of GOD. The prayer of a faithful man, doth not croſs his other duties. The ſame LORD that commands him to pray, orders him alſo to labour. To oblige him to the one, He doth not diſpenſe with him for the other. He intends, that he acquit himſelf of them both. Let prayer begin, guide, and end his labour; let his labour ſeal, follow, and accompany his prayer. Let him pray with his hand upon his work; let him work with heart and eyes lift up unto prayer. Let theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes fill up his whole life; parting the dayes, and hours thereof between them, and keeping faithful and indiſſoluble company, all along. St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed; but this devotion did not hinder him from preaching to the preſent, from writing to the abſent, from inſtructing the teachable, from reprehending tranſgreſſors, from confirming them within, from drawing thoſe without, from fortifying the faithful, from convincing the adverſaries, from employing his time in a multitude of good, and holy actions. What means he then by ſaying, that he ceaſeth not to pray for the <hi>Coloſſians?</hi> He would only ſay, that he is very aſſiduous at it; that he doth it, as often as time, and place permit it; that there paſſeth neither day, nor night; but he doth them this charitable office: not to alledge here,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Auguſtine in</hi> Pſal. 37.</note> what an Ancient elegantly ſaith; that our deſires being prayers, theſe are continual, when our deſires are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual. This example of the Apoſtle teacheth Paſtors in particular; that beſide preaching the Word, they owe alſo to their flocks, the ſuccour of their prayers, not only the publick, but their private ones alſo. For how can they without crime, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get perſons, that are ſo ſtrictly united to them? Their Crown, and their Glory? The ground of their joy, and the ſubject of their moſt precious labour?</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle, beſides the aſſiduity of his prayers for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ſhews us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ardour, and devotion of them, when he ſaith, that <hi>he prayeth, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50919:17"/>for them.</hi> For the firſt of thoſe words ſignifieth the elevation of the ſoul to GOD; when fixing its eyes on the greatneſs of this ſupream Majeſty, it adores Him, and gives Him the glory of a perfect goodneſs, power, and wiſdom. This is as the <hi>exordium,</hi> and Preface of Prayer, to move the LORD, that He do give us favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble audience. After which comes that, which the Apoſtle calls here, The demand; that is, the very requeſt we make the LORD, beſeeching Him to give libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to us, or to our brethren, the benefits, we have need of. From which we have to obſerve by the way, the order we ſhould keep in our prayers, that they may be legitimate, and grateful unto GOD: namely, that at the entrance, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Him an heart, full of humble, and affectionate reſpect to Him; that reveres Him, as Almighty, and All-wiſe; that loves Him, as infinitely good, and praiſeth, and glorifieth Him, as perfectly bleſſed. The requeſts, which are preſented to Him, otherwiſe, heedleſly, and without this preparation, are more apt to provoke His wrath, than attract His beneficence. After this firſt motion, we ſhould next make our requeſts, with a great, and ardent deſire; and a filial confidence. It's thus the Apoſtle prayed for the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now come to the third point, and ſee what was the matter, to ſubject of his Prayer. <hi>We ceaſe not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to demand of GOD, that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will, in all wiſdome, and ſpiritual underſtanding.</hi> It ſufficiently appears, by the praiſes he gave the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> before, that they were already much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the knowledge of GOD, and of His Goſpel; therefore he doth not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply demand of the LORD, that they may be made partakers of this knowledge; but that they might be <hi>filled</hi> with it. For there are great differences in knowledge. Firſt, in regard of its extent; and next in regard of its degrees. For its extent, it comprehends the things themſelves, that we can know; which being almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it is evident a man may know ſome, who yet knoweth not others. And as for its degrees; one ſelf-ſame thing is known more clearly and more diſtinctly by one; more obſcurely, and confuſedly by another. It's the ſame in this, as it is in ſeeing: One ſeeth, and diſcovereth more objects, than another; and of thoſe that ſee one and the ſame object, one ſeeth it much more clearly, and purely than another; and whatever be the cauſe of this diverſity, whether the inequality of their eyes, or the difference of their attention, or that of the light which brightens them, ſo it is, that their ſeeing is very different: that of the one being imperfect, and defective in compariſon of the other's. The Apoſtle therefore beſeeching the LORD, that the <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſſians</hi> might be filled with knowledge, intendeth, that they might obtain of His goodneſs a perfection both of the one, and the other ſort; firſt, that if there were any points of the Goſpel not yet come to their knowledge, He would grant them the grace to obſerve, and apprehend them; and ſecondly, that if they did not purely enough apprehend the things, they knew already; He would ſo ſhine on them by the light of His ſpirit, that they might clearly and diſtinctly perceive them. For it is in theſe two points, that the fulneſs, or perfection, he wiſheth them in this place, doth conſiſt: the one, not to be ignorant of any of the neceſſary particulars of the myſterie revealed to us, by the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST. The other, to know each of theſe particulars clearly, and diſtinctly, ſeeing the truth of them, as in a great, and reſplendant light. Beſides, we muſt remember, that as the eſtate of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is of one ſort here below, where he travails for a time; and after another on high in Heaven, where he ſhall live in the boſome of GOD; ſo the perfection of his knowledge is of two ſorts, the one earthly, and the other heavenly. This ſame is his laſt, and higheſt perfection; that ſame is but the diſpoſition, and beginning of it: the one is the perfection of his infancy, the other of his full age. And though the firſt may be in a ſenſe, and in ſome reſpect, truly termed fulneſs and perfection, yet in regard of the other it's imperfect. Whence it comes that the Apoſtle elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, putting theſe two knowledges in parallel one with the other, ſaith that now we know,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9, 10, 11, 12.</note> but in part and ſee but darkly in a glaſs, whereas in the other World, we ſhall ſee face to face, and know as we have been known. And in the ſame place, he compareth the knowledge, we have here below, to the thoughts of a child, and that which we ſhall have on high, to the thoughts, and judgement of a perfect man. Then all the arguments of the truth of the Goſpel, ſhall be ſo mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50919:17"/>diſplayed, before our eyes, that doubt of it ſhall not be able to take place any more; and whereas now we ſee but the images of things; then we ſhall touch the ſubſtance of them; beſides that the light of our underſtandings ſhall be incomparably more clear, and pure, than it is here below. But though conſidering the thing in its ſelf, one may call perfect, only the knowledge of a believer enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the viſion of his LORD on high in the Heavens; yet referring, and ajuſting it to the ſtate we are now in; there is alſo on earth a ſort of knowledge, which in this reſpect may be called perfect: namely the higheſt meaſure a faithful perſon can attain, while he is here beneath. As, though the knowledge of a child be far below the lights of a perfect man, yet this hinders not, but there is a certain form, and meaſure of knowledge proportionate to the capacity of this age, which when the Child is come to, we ſay it is an accompliſhed Child, yea moſt accompliſhed. For every age hath its perfection, and every greatneſs, its full height. Tis then of this ſecond ſort of perfection, and fulneſs the Apoſtle intends to ſpeak, when he prayes the LORD, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might be filled with knowledge; that is, not that they might ſee the LORD face to face (this is not given, but in the other world) but that they might receive, of his goodneſs, all the light neceſſary for the eſtate, we are in here below; and as high and rich a meaſure of knowledge as may, and ſhould be had on earth, for getting one day to the upmoſt degree in the Kingdom of Heaven. And note here, by the way, the holy artifice of the Apoſtle: By praying GOD, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might be filled, he ſecretly advertiſeth them, that they yet wanted ſomething; that he might render them teachable, and attentive to the inſtructions, he will hereafter give them. For thoſe, that think they are perfect, and have an entire, and accompliſhed knowledge, do diſdain what any one would add thereto, as a thing ſuperfluous, and unprofitable. Therefore he time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes away this imagination from the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that they may patiently ſuffer him to inſtruct them, and finiſh in them what was only rough-drawn. To the ſame end, doth that tend which he addeth, that they might be filled with the knowledge, of the will of GOD. For by this word he rejecteth, and removeth far from this ſubject, all the inventions and doctrines of men; the diſputes, and ſubtilities of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; the voluntary devotions, and ſuperſtitions, which had been ſowed among the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> by the falſe teachers; as things rather contrary, than uſeful, to the perfection, and happineſs of man; and reſtraineth all the knowledge he deſireth for them, to the ſole will of God, as its true object, and its juſt meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Upon which, we have firſt to remark; that the word here uſed by the Apoſtle in the Original, and which we have tranſlated <hi>knowledge,</hi> ſignifieth properly a great, and ample knowledge; and theſe holy Authors employ it ordinarily to expreſs, that knowledge of GOD, which is given us by the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST. For the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Doctrine of the Prophets doth indeed teach, what is the will of GOD. But it hath not <hi>deſigned</hi> to declare it ſo purely, and ſo fully as the Goſpel. Whence it comes, that St.
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.19.</note> 
                        <hi>Peter</hi> compareth the light of the Prophets to that of a <hi>candle ſhining in a dark place,</hi> and that of the Goſpel, to <hi>the brightneſs of the day.</hi> And its hereto St. <hi>John</hi> hath reſpect, when he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.18.</note> 
                        <hi>that no man hath ſeen GOD at any time, and that the only Son which is in the boſome of the Father, He hath revealed Him.</hi> Becauſe the knowledge, which was of Him, before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the LORD JESUS, was ſo weak; as it is ſcarce conſiderable in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that, which is given <hi>us.</hi> It's therefore properly this Evangelical, and Chriſtian knowledge, which the Apoſtle wiſheth here to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> oppoſing it to that of the Law, the rudiments whereof ſome endeavoured to re-eſtabliſh among them. Secondly, we muſt obſerve, what is the object of this knowledge, the <hi>knowledge</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the will of GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All men naturally deſire to know; and I avouch, that every knowledge is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and grateful; and there is none truly ſuch, but addeth ſome ornament to our underſtanding. Yet it muſt be confeſſed, that they are for the moſt part incapable of giving us the perfection, and happineſs we deſire, and which is neceſſary for our nature. Such are all <hi>mundane</hi> ſciences, found out, and cultivated by the ſages of the World: not only their Philoſophy about nature, and the motions of the Heavens, and the Elements; and about the properties, and effects of things animate,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50919:18"/>and inanimate; but alſo that part of their Doctrine, which more neerly reſpecteth us, and explaineth, what our carriage ſhould be, both in particular; and in reſpect of thoſe that govern us, or are governed of us, either in the family, or in the State. For, to ſay nothing of the variety, and extream uncertainty of their opinions, which change every day, and float continually in infinite doubts; after having paſſed an whole life in this ſtudy, and made the greateſt progreſſes that may be, no man is by it, either more content, or more happy, or more aſſured. All the pretended light of their School, will not be able to diſſipate in us, either the horrour of death, or the fear of the Judgement of GOD. It is only the knowledge of the LORD, that can free us of it; and by conſequence, it alone is neceſſary for us: the reſt will not render us either more happy, if we have them; or more miſerable, if we have them not. It's then this alone, which the Apoſtle wiſheth unto the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> But we muſt yet conſider, in the Third place, that He wiſheth them the knowledge, not of the nature, or the Majeſty, or the other eſſential properties of GOD; but of His will. For as to the eſſence of this ſupream, and incomprehenſible LORD; as to the infinite, and immenſe greatneſs of His power; as to the ineffable manner of His underſtanding, and the marvels of His judgement, it is not neceſſary for us to know them clearly. It is ſufficient for us, to adore them, and many have loſt themſelves, in luſting to ſound them. It is His Will, that we muſt know, to attain ſalvation, as the true rule of our duty, and His judgement. He hath fully declared it to us, by the Miniſtry of His Heralds, the Apoſtles and Prophets, who have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it by word of mouth, and configned it in writing, in the Holy Books, which they have left us. There it is, that we muſt ſeek it, and not in the diſcourſes of vain men. There we ſhall find it manifeſted, as far as is neceſſary for us to know, and do it. It hath two principal parts, faith, and obedience. For the will of GOD, as the Apoſtle underſtands it here, is nothing elſe, but that which GOD would have us believe,
<note place="margin">Joh. 6.40.</note> and do, to be happy. For faith, His will is (ſaith our LORD) that whoever ſeeth the Son, and believeth in Him, have eternal life, and be raiſed up at the laſt day.
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.3.</note> For action, This is the will of GOD (ſaith the Apoſtle) even your ſanctification. Theſe are the two firſt, and principal heads of the will of GOD, to which all other inſtructions in Scripture do referr. It's in the knowledge of theſe things, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth GOD, the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might be perfect, and accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>He addeth, in all wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtanding. We call them Wiſe men, in the world, that know how to compaſs their ends, that uſe means fit for this purpoſe, and skilfully avoid all that might put them from it; ſo dextrouſly conducting their affairs, that of two things, the one follows; either they finiſh that which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; or if they proſper not in it, it is ſome miſhap, and not their fault, that is the cauſe of ſuch ill ſucceſs; But becauſe they propoſe unto themſelves, ends vain, and evil, and unprofitable to their happineſs; thence it comes, that how wiſe ſoever they be eſteemed by the world; all their induſtry yet is, to ſay true, but folly, and errour. Thoſe then, on the contrary, are wiſe after the Spirit, who conſtantly hold the right courſe of piety, guiding themſelves in it with ſuch skilfulneſs, that they beware of ſcandals, and all that might ſet them off from their mark; avoiding what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, and practiſing what is uſeful. And though the world commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them extravagant; yet ſo it is, that their conduct proves to be true wiſdom; ſince at the end, and after all, it will be found, that none but they attain unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It is then this skilfulneſs, which the Apoſtle termeth here, a ſpiritual wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; both becauſe it reſpecteth the things of the Spirit, that appertain to a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial, and ſpiritual life; as alſo for that it is a gift of the Spirit of GOD, coming from on high, from the Father of lights; neither the ſenſe, nor the reaſon of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being capable of giving it to any knowledge of the Divine will, is, as it were, the matter, and ſubject of wiſdom; Wiſdom is, as it were, the uſe, and employing of the knowledge of GOD. For to be wiſe after the Spirit, it is not enough to know what is the will of GOD, There muſt be uſe of this knowledge; firſt by laying down for a certain and unmoveable maxime, that it is in it our bliſs conſiſteth: and conſequently, that therein we muſt bound our deſires. Secondly by practiſing what we know of this Divine will, aiming at the mark it ſheweth us, and employing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50919:18"/>to attain it, the means it preſcribeth us, watching and labouring continually thereto. For certainly that ſervant in the Parable, who knew his Maſters will, and did it not, was nothing leſs than wiſe. As for the ſpiritual underſtanding, which the Apoſtle wiſheth, in the laſt place, to the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> it is a quick, and exquiſite prudence to judge aright of things that are preſented, and diſcern the good from the evil, the true from the falſe, and the real from the apparent: and this gift (as you ſee) is alſo a fruit of the knowledge of GOD: and conſiſteth only in an exact application of what we know of His will; to the doctrines, and counſels, which the fleſh, and its Miniſters ſet before us, to turn us out of the way of ſalvation. It's this, was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Eve,</hi> when ſhe was ſeduced by the Serpent; and to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> when they were abuſed by thoſe impoſtors: the Apoſtle fearing leſt the ſame ſhould betide the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to divert this fatal blow, ſupplicates the LORD to give them underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary for the happy ſevering the falſe colours, the paintings, and baits of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, from the ſimplicity that is in CHRIST. Therefore he demandeth not of Him only, that they might be filled with the knowledge of His will in wiſdom, and underſtanding; but in ALL wiſdom, and underſtanding: that is to ſay, very abundantly, and in ſo great and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> a meaſure, as none of the parts, none of the operations of this divine ability, be wanting to them: after the ſame manner, as when He ſaith elſewhere, have all faith, to ſignifie ſo high and raiſed a meaſure of it, as no kind, and no degree of faith is wanting. Such is, well-beloved Brethren, the ardent, and affectionate Prayer, which the Apoſtle made continually for theſe <hi>Coloſſians, That they might be filled with the knowledge of the will of GOD, in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſpiritual underſtanding:</hi> that is, in ſuch ſort, as this knowledge might form in them an exquiſite ſageneſs, and ſpiritual prudence.</p>
                     <p>It Remaineth, that, to end, we briefly touch at the principal leſſons, we are to take out of it, for the inſtruction of our faith, and the amendment of our manners. Firſt, you ſee, how far the judgement of the Apoſtle is from the doctrine, and practice of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Apoſtle willeth, that the faithful do know the will of GOD, that they be filled with this knowledge. <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that their faith is better defined by ignorance, than by knowledge, and that it is ſufficient for them to have, and I know not what implicite faith (as they call it) which without knowing ought its ſelf, referrs its ſelf to the faith of another. The Apoſtle willeth, that the faithful be endowed with all wiſdom, and ſpiritual underſtanding. <hi>Rome</hi> ſeareth nothing ſo much, as this; and deſireth that without knowing, or underſtanding ought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they leave this whole ſtudy to their Curates; contenting themſelves with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they believe, what the Church believes: not knowing mean time what it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth indeed. Darkneſs is not more contrary to Light, than this pretended faith to wiſdom, and underſtanding. Their practice is conform to their doctrine. For they hide the Scripture from their people; the ſacred, and authentick evidence of the Will of GOD, the living and teeming ſource of all wiſdom, and heavenly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and if in their ſervice they repeat any paſſages of it, they repeat them in a ſtrange language, that their people may hear it, and not underſtand it. Faithful ſirs, thank GOD, for that He hath withdrawn you from this Kingdom of darkneſs: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy with gratitude the light He hath ſet up in the midſt of you. Learn in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, what is the will of the LORD, the head, and the foundation of true wiſdom. Make account, that this knowledge is the gate of Heaven, the entrance of eternity, the ſeed of the divine nature, and the principle of Celeſtial life. Without it, how will you love GOD; ſince none loves, what he knows not? Without it, how will you obey GOD, ſince to obey Him is no other thing but to do His will? Without it, how will you reſiſt the enemy? how will you free your ſelves from his wiles? how will you diſcern his impoſtures from divine truth? Judge what account the Apoſtle maketh of it, ſince it's the firſt thing he asks of GOD for theſe <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> whom he ſo ardently affected. If you will attain the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which he directeth them, have that which he with ſo much paſſion deſireth in them. Remember, you are the people of the Sun of righteouſneſs, of the eternal wiſdom, and word, the workmanſhip of His Comforter, who is a Spirit of wiſdom and of underſtanding:
<note place="margin">Deut. 33. Iſai. 1.</note> and that one of the greateſt reproaches GOD ever made to His <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is, the calling them a fooliſh people, and unwiſe: that hath neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50919:19"/>nor underſtanding. And ſince you ſee that the Apoſtle demands of GOD this divine wiſdom for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> addreſs your ſelves alſo to that Father of lights, from whom cometh down hither every good gift. Preſs Him; importune Him; quit Him not, till He have revealed His myſteries to you; till He have lightned your eyes, and your hearts, to make you ſee the wonders of His wiſdom. But unto prayer add alſo ſtudy; Read, and hear His word carefully; meditate it both here, and at home; render it familiar to you; commune of it with your neighbours, and inſtruct your Children in it. As I grant, this labour is unprofitable: without the grace of the LORD; ſo I maintain that with it, it is moſt efficacious. <hi>Paul</hi> would Preach to <hi>Lydia</hi> in vain, if GOD did not open her heart. But if GOD ſet to His hand, it is not in vain that <hi>Paul</hi> labours for it. And to attract this ſaving hand of the LORD, joyn unto prayer the Offerings of your alms, the perfume of a good and holy life. Make uſe of what you know. Mannage theſe firſt fruits of light, which you have received already. Employ the Talent that hath been given you; and the Maſter will give you on it, others greater. How would you He ſhould communicate new graces to people, that ſo vilely abuſe the firſt? You know His will, and do that of the Devil, and the Fleſh. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>th made you a preſent of the Goſpel; and you drag it in the dirt. He hath marked you with His ſeals, and you foul them in the ordures of vice. You impudently bear His Liveries into the debauches of the world; and the Diſciples of Heaven are as ardent as the Children of this Generation, after the diſſoluteneſs of the time. GOD forbid, that wiſdom, and ſpiritual underſtanding, ſhould lodge in hearts ſo profane. It's a jewell too precious to ſhine otherwhere, than in Heaven, that is in pure, and holy ſouls. So far will you be from encreaſing your light, if you change not manners, that GOD will take away this little which remaineth, and let you return into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to live once more in its miſerable darkneſs. But GOD keep us from ſo great an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, my Brethren, well-beloved: and to prevent it let us in good earneſt convert us unto Him; renouncing the luſts of the world, and the filth of the fleſh, living in an exemplary purity, and honeſty, that the LORD may take pleaſure in the midſt of us; that He may make the knowledge of His will abound in us, in all wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtanding: and after the faith and hopes of this life, receive us, in the eternity of the other, unto the Viſion, and fruition of His glory. So be it: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, Father, Son, and Spirit, the true GOD bleſſed for ever, be all honour and praiſe. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>PHiloſophers, both Pagan, and Chriſtian, do commonly divide the Sciences into two ſorts; The Speculative, which ſeek only the knowledge of their ſubject, reſting in it, when they have once acquired it, without pretending any further; and the Practical, which aim at action, and conſider things only for the ſitting us to do them. Of the firſt ſort is Aſtronomy, which hath no deſign, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the motions of the heavenly bodies; and the Mathematiques, which are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in the ſtudy of magnitude, and number, without having other end, than to know the nature of them. Of the ſecond ſort is Science Moral, or the Ethiques; which teach us, but in order to action; and ſhew us what each of the Vertues is, to the end we may practiſe them, and live according to the rules this Science gives us. It's diſputed in the Schools, to which of theſe two kinds of Sciences belongs Sacred Theologie; that is, the doctrine of Divine things revealed to us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. For on one hand it teacheth us divers things of the nature of GOD, and of Angels, and of the World to come, and ſuch other myſteries, which ſeem to be objects of contemplation only, and not of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. On the other hand it gives us divers Rules for practice: and this mixture hath induced ſome to think, that it is a diſcipline, not ſimple, and uniform; but miſcellaneous, and compoſed of the one, and the other kind. Our Apoſtle, in my opinion, clearly decides the queſtion in this place. For having afore, wiſhed the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> a rich, and full knowledge of this divine doctrine in all wiſdom, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual underſtanding, he ſtayes not there, but adds, in the Text we have read, the end it is ſubſervient to. <hi>To the end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye may walk worthily, as is beſeeming the LORD, unto the pleaſing Him in all things, fructifying in every good work.</hi> Here you ſee, he ſtates it expreſly, that the end of knowledge is practice: holy walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fructifying in every good work, being evidently doing. Whence follows, that it ought to be placed among the Active Sciences; ſince their end is the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of their nature, and that which properly gives them the rank they are to hold. I grant, it treats of the Eſſence, and Attributes of GOD; but it's with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to carry us thereby unto the love and ſervice of His Majeſty, that is, unto acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whence it comes, that in Scripture, to know GOD, is almoſt alwayes taken for to ſerve Him, according to that light of the knowledge of Himſelf, which He hath given us.</p>
                     <p>But it is of no great importance for us to know, what rank this heavenly diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is of among the Sciences; provided we hold faſt this principle of the Apoſtle's,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50919:20"/>that the end, why we ſhould be inſtructed in the knowledge of GOD, is a godly life; and not the ſoothing of our minds, or the contenting our curioſity with a vain delight: much leſs, the being able to entertain, with ſuch high myſteries, the company we chance to be in. For as we call that man an Architect, not who can handſomly diſcourſe of buildings; but that hath the art to erect them; and as we give not the name, and glory of a Captain, to one that can elequently ſpeak of War, but to him that can manage it, and is of capacity to conduct an army skilfully, and can withſtand, and fight an enemy; and acquit himſelf in all the functions of a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary command; ſo we muſt hold for a Chriſtian, not him who knoweth, and can pertinently explain the duties of the faithful; but him that performs them. It's in the life, and not in talk, that this Science doth conſiſt, in the heart, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; not in the brain, and in the tongue. Let this then be effectually the end of this holy ſtudy. Let us learn, not ſimply to know, or to ſpeak; but to do, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reducing into practice, all the preſcriptions of this heavenly doctrine. And that we may rightly comprehend this legitimate end of our knowledge, let us me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate the leſſon which the Apoſtle now gives us concerning it. It contains two Heads: Firſt, The very life, and actions, which we are to endeavour, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The firmneſs, and patience wherewith we ſhould perſevere in them. Theſe ſhall be (GOD willing) the two ſubjects, we will treat of in the preſent action. The Apoſtle explaineth us the former of them in the tenth Verſe, <hi>That ye may walk worthily, as is beſeeming the LORD, unto the pleaſing of Him in all things, fructifying in every good work, and increaſing in the knowledge of GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe words, as you ſee, he ſhews us, firſt the end of the knowledge of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in general, which is, a walking worthily, as is beſeeming the LORD. Next, he ſets before us the principal parts of this <hi>worthy walking.</hi> The firſt reſpects the ſcope, it propoſeth to its ſelf, even the pleaſing of GOD in all things. The ſecond, the actions, wherein it ought to be employed; which are a fructifying in every good work. The third, its progreſs, and advancement, which is, to increaſe in the knowledge of GOD. Here then, Chriſtian ſoul, is the true, and only end of that heavenly light, which hath been communicated to you; that you walk worthily, as is beſeeming the LORD. You know, the Scripture ordinarily compares the life of man, unto a journey; and the actions and deſignes, and employments, he paſſeth it in, unto a path, or way. In effect, after we are once entred the world, we inceſſantly eloign us from the point of our Nativity, as from the place whence we departed, and advance towards death as a common habitation, where all do meet alike, ſome ſooner, others later. As for other travellours, they may ſtay if it ſeem them good, or return unto the place from whence they came. But <hi>we</hi> cannot poſſibly do the one, or the other. Time enwrapping us about from the firſt point of our life, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth us away ſtill forward; whether we wake or ſleep; whether we conſent to it, or ſtrive to the contrary; without permitting us to turn back, or to repoſe our ſelves, one ſingle moment; juſt as he, whom the Sea, and the wind carry on in a Veſſel, ſo as his own particular motion ſerveth not at all, either to ſtop, or to ſlack his courſe. But as the wayes, and deſignes of travellors are very different: ſo there is an huge diverſity, between the forms, and manners of the life of men. The way, that the wicked follow, is one; and that of good men, another. The Pagan ſteereth one courſe; the <hi>Jew,</hi> and the <hi>Mahometan</hi> another; and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> another, wholly different. This is that the Scripture calls, The way of man; underſtanding by this word, the form, and inſtitution of life, which every one doth follow. And ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to this dainty figure, it often makes uſe of the word Walking, to ſignifie direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forming, and compoſing the life after ſome certain manner, whether good, or evil: intending thereby the tenour of life we lead; and the deportments, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to which we addict our ſelves. There is nothing more common in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> than theſe forms of ſpeech; to walk in Integrity; or on the contrary, in Fraud, and Iniquity; and in the Writings of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> to walk in Light, or in Darkneſs, after the Spirit, or after the Fleſh; and other like Phraſes; which all ſignifie a certain form, and condition of life, good, or evil, as it is qualified. According to the ſtile of Scripture, the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>to the end, that you may walk;</hi> meaning, that you may live, that you may direct, and form your lives.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:50919:20"/>
                     <p>But how will he, that we walk? <hi>worthily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as is ſeemly towards the LORD.</hi> It is word for word in the Original, <hi>worthily of the LORD;</hi> or in a faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worthy of the LORD. But our French Bible hath faithfully repreſented the ſenſe of theſe words; it being evident, that the Apoſtle intendeth, we ſhould lead a life, that anſwereth to the honour we have, of being Children, and Diſciples of JESUS the LORD; His co-heirs, and heirs of His Father. He elſe-where often uſeth this manner of ſpeaking, or others altogether like it. As when he exhorteth the <hi>Philippians</hi> to converſe in ſuch ſort, as may be worthy of the Goſpel;
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.28. Eph. 4.1. 1 Theſ. 2.12.</note> and the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith they had been called; and when in like manner he adjureth the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> to walk worthy of GOD, who hath called them to His Kingdom, and Glory. The teachers of merits have drawn from theſe paſſages, that proud name, which they ordinarily give them, calling them, merits of condignity; pretending, that to walk worthy of GOD, ſignifies, meriting of life by their works, properly, and in the accompt of exact juſtice. But they are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deceived. For not to ſpeak of the vanity of this preſumption, which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and reaſon it ſelf do thunder-ſtrike a thouſand wayes; it is clear, that to be worthy of any thing, ſignifieth not at all in theſe paſſages, the meriting it properly, and exactly. For who is there, that would thus interpret the Apoſtles ſaying, walk worthy of GOD, that is, lead a life that merits GOD? There are people found, that have opinion of themſelves good enough, to imagine, they merit Heaven, and the glory of the life to come. There hath none been yet ſeen, that I know, who vaunted Himſelf to merit GOD. This language would be monſtrous, and ſurpaſs the pride of Devils themſelves. It's too much preſuming, but to affirm, that any merit the gifts of GOD. Common ſenſe permitteth not a man to think, or ſay, that he merits GOD. As ill, doth, what the Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere, ſuffer this gloſs. Converſe in a faſhion worthy of the Goſpel, and live in a faſhion worthy of the Vocation of GOD. For who ever heard ſay, that our works do merit, either the Goſpel, or the Vocation of GOD? a thing paſt, and which we have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the liberality of the LORD, before the having done any one good work? It is clear, that in all theſe places, the worthineſs, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is nothing elſe, but a certain well-beſeemingneſs, ariſing from the correſpondence, that is found between us, and the ſubjects, whereof he ſaith we are worthy. Juſt as when St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> exhorteth the Jews to bring forth fruits worthy of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he meaneth, not that merit repentance, but that anſwer thereto; that are ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the ſenſe we have of our own ſin, and of the Grace of GOD. In like manner here, a life holy, and full of piety, and of good works, is worthy of GOD, not becauſe it merits Him; but becauſe it hath ſome ſuitableneſs with His ſanctity and glory. It is worthy of the Goſpel; becauſe it is correſpondent to it, and conform to what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us. It is worthy of the Vocation of GOD, becauſe carried to things, to which He calleth us, and produceth the fruits, which He demandeth of us.</p>
                     <p>Would you then know, Chriſtian, what your life ſhould be? let it be worthy of the LORD. St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath compriſed all in theſe few words. And as ſometime a Prince, faln into the hands of his enemy, who demanded of him, how he ſhould treat him, anſwered, as a King, ſignifying by that one word all the moderation, and generoſity he deſired ſhould be uſed towards Him: So the Apoſtle, in theſe two words, embraceth the whole form of our carriage. How ſhall we live? <hi>Lead</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a life, that may be worthy of the LORD.</hi> This is enough to let us underſtand, that neither avarice, nor cruelty, nor hatred, nor envy, nor any other of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, muſt have any place in our manners; but that juſtice, charity, and all other pure and celeſtial affections ſhould ſhine forth in them: that there ſhould be mixed in them, nothing baſe, nor abject: but that all ſhould be great, and generous, and elevated above the dunghills of the Fleſh. Have then, Believer, this ſupream LORD continually before your eyes. Interrogate your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience upon each of the things, that are preſented to you, whether they be worthy of Him; and do not any, that may not be put in this rank. Flee all that croſſeth the quality of His diſciple; all that ſwerveth from the rule, which He hath given you; all that diverts you from the Kingdom, to which He conducteth you. This LORD is purity, and ſanctity it ſelf; He is entirely ſeparate from ſinners; He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50919:21"/>had any communion with vice. This LORD is ſoveraignly good; He hateth no man; He prayed even for them, that Crucified Him, and did infinite benefits to them, that injured, and blaſphemed Him. This LORD neither poſſeſſed, nor coveted the honours, and grandeurs of the earth. All His glory is divine, and His grandeur celeſtial. His diſcipline is like His life; He enjoyneth us throughout, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſingular innocency, ſanctity, and goodneſs; and the good things He promiſeth us are ſpiritual, and not carnal: the inheritance He hath purchaſed for us, and to the poſſeſſion whereof He leadeth us, is in Heaven, and not on the earth. Upon this it's eaſie to judge, what is this form of life <hi>worthy of Him,</hi> which the Apoſtle commandeth us. It is a life, that hath reſemblance with His; wherein ſhine forth, both the examples of His Divine Vertues, and the marks of His doctrine, and the badges of His houſe, and the firſt fruits of His glory. It is a life, that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under foot the baſeneſs of all vices: that diſdaineth what the fleſh, and the world do promiſe to their ſlaves: and beholding with contempt, all that the earth adore, hath no paſſion but for Heaven. It's a life ſweet, and humble, and innocent, that obligeth all men, and injures none at all; that without turning to the right hand, or the left, runs on, and advanceth inceſſantly, towards the mark of the ſupernal calling. It's thus you muſt live, faithful ſoul, if you would ſatisfie the light you have received of the knowledge of GOD. I confeſs it is an high deſign. But neither is it for low, and common things, that GOD hath given you His Son, and His Spirit. If our infirmity makes fear, let the power, and the might of the LORD aſſure us. And if there eſcape us ſometime any act unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Him; as in this fleſh, wherewith we are cloathed, there do eſcape us but too many; let us combat our own weakneſſes; and have recourſe unto the grace of GOD, who pardoning us, what is paſt, will fortifie us for the future.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle, after having enjoyned us in general, that our life be worthy of the LORD, toucheth next the principal duties, whereof we muſt acquit us, to live in this ſort; and addeth firſt, that we do pleaſe Him entirely: that is, that in all things, we ſeek to pleaſe the LORD, endeavouring nothing but what may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Him; that this be the aim of our life. Whence appears, that the firſt point of a life celeſtial, and truly worthy of the LORD, is to take His will for our ſupream rule, by it ſquaring all our thoughts, words, and actions. For this is that the Apoſtle ſignifieth, when He ſaith, we muſt entirely pleaſe Him: that is, in all things, in all the parts of life; both in what reſpects the ſentiments of our hearts, and in what concerns the words of our mouths, or our other external actions. This is as the ſoul of the ſervice of God. You ſerve a man, or your ſelves, and not the LORD, when it is to content your ſelves, or ſome other, that you act. The beſt action, and in its ſelf moſt holy, loſeth its worth, and value, when the deſign of pleaſing GOD is wanting in it. Let us then baniſh from our life, firſt, all thoſe things which GOD hath not inſtituted. For how fair an appearance ſoever they have, we cannot aſſure our ſelves, that they pleaſe the LORD, if He hath not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them. Let us not ſuffer our ſelves to be beguiled by the paint, and falſe luſtre of humane devotion. Since the queſtion is of pleaſing GOD, we muſt give our ſelves to the ſtudy, and practice of that, which Himſelf hath expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, in His word. As to this, I am moſt certain, it's a thing acceptable to Him. But for that which ſuperſtition, or the pretended wiſdom of men hath invented, I cannot be aſſured, whether it pleaſe the LORD, or no. Then next, in the very performance of the things He hath commanded us, let us have regard ſtill to pleaſe <hi>Him.</hi> Offer we not our Sacrifices, but to His Deity alone. If our actions be alſo acceptable to men, in good time be it: It is gain we may take with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. But how ever they take it, have we ſtill for our end, to pleaſe the LORD. Provided that our oblations are grateful to Him, let the world judge of them, as it will. We have that we ſought, and it ſufficeth us to have contented the eyes of our Maſter. Let us renounce our own wills, and regard His only, wiſhing daily, that it might be done of us, and all other Creatures, as the LORD JESUS hath commanded us.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle adds in the ſecond place, the productions of Chriſtian life, <hi>Frustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in every good work.</hi> This neceſſarily follows from the affection, he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50919:21"/>but now recommended to us. For if we ſtudy to pleaſe the LORD entirely, ſince it is only good works that can be acceptable to Him, it is evident, we ſhall give our ſelves to them continually. But the Apoſtle uſeth in it a remarkable term, ſaying to ſignifie this production, that we <hi>fructifie in every good work.</hi> The Scripture often compareth the faithful, to Trees; becauſe they are planted by the hand of GOD, ſprung from His celeſtial, and incorruptible ſeed, that is, His word; and you know how the Prophet, in the firſt Pſalm repreſents us, a good man, and one fearing GOD, under the image of a Tree, planted by a ſtream of living water, yielding its fruit in its ſeaſon, and crowned with a green, and grateful feuillage, which never fadeth, And elſewhere he compares him to a flouriſhing, and fruitful Palm-tree,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 92.13, 14, 15. Joh. 15. Rom. 11:</note> in the Courts of the LORD. JESUS CHRIST ſaith in St. <hi>John,</hi> That He is the Vine, and we are the Branches, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> compares the Iſrael of GOD, that is, the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of His children, to a true Olive, whereinto each of them is grafted, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of its ſap, and fatneſs. Sutably to theſe Allegories, it's with much grace, and reaſon, that the Apoſtle makes uſe of the word, <hi>fructifie,</hi> to ſignifie the production of our good works. That immortal juice, which hath been ſhed into us from on high by the Word and Spirit, obligeth us to this ſecondity; it not having been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us, but to produce in us the fruits of righteouſneſs, and holineſs. It's this the LORD expects from His myſtical Vineyard, demanding of it this juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the care He takes to husband it. And as we love trees, which do not unprofitably take up our ground, but beſides leaves, and bloſſoms bear us a quantity of fruits: ſo is it with the heavenly Vineyard-keeper. He ſeeks for fruit on His myſtical trees: He condemneth to the fire, the fig-tree that bears none; He loveth, and purgeth that which beareth any. Good works are the fruits, He requireth of us; yea every ſort of good works: <hi>Fructifying</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in every good work.</hi> Nature giveth not, to any of the Trees <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> it produceth, the faculty of bringing forth more than one kind of fruits only; becauſe the ſeed of which they grow is earthly, and material. But grace, which generateth the LORD's myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal plants of a ſeed ſpiritual, and divine, makes them capable of bearing infinite fruits of every ſort. This the Apoſtle calls good works, commanded of GOD in His word, uſeful to the advancement of His glory, and the edification of our Neighbour. Let no one flatter himſelf, as if the vain greenneſs of leaves, the outward profeſſion of Chriſtianity, would ſuffice Him to be numbred among the plants of the LORD. He acknowledgeth for His, the trees only that bear fruit. There is more yet. It's not enough to bear one certain kind of fruits: there muſt be <hi>fructifying in every good work.</hi> Your alms will ſerve you for nothing, if they be not accompanied with the fruits of honeſty, and ſanctification. In vain ſhall you have been adorned with meekneſs, and gentleneſs; if you have not alſo chaſtity, and beneficence.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Apoſtle willeth in the third, and laſt place; <hi>that we increaſe in the knowledge of the LORD.</hi> See, faithful Brethren, how this Holy man every where joyneth together knowledge, and action; faith, and charity. He begs of GOD, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might be compleated in wiſdom, and ſpiritual underſtanding; to the end, ſaith he, that they may walk in a faſhion worthy of the LORD, <hi>and fructifie in every good work.</hi> But for fear they ſhould imagine, they had no more need to ſtudy after knowledge, He comes to it yet again, and addeth, <hi>increaſing in the knowledge of God.</hi> For as our ſanctification is never perfect here below; ſo there wanteth alwayes ſomething in our knowledge. There muſt be endeavour equally after the one, and the other; And as the light of knowledge carrieth, and fitteth us to the practice of good works; ſo the exerciſe of good works, cleanſeth the eyes of our underſtandings, and encreaſeth true wiſdom: on the contrary, the neglect of ſanctification, diminiſheth this divine clearneſs in us; and bringeth back by little, and little the darkneſs of ignorance upon us. For as the LORD giveth new graces, to him that faithfully manageth His firſt preſents; ſo takes He away His Talent from Him, that abuſeth it. Thoſe that caſt away a good conſcience, make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack alſo of Faith; and they that withhold the truth in unrighteouſneſs, are given up to a mind disfurniſhed of all judgement; and GOD ſendeth the efficacy of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to thoſe, that receive not his Holy doctrine with love. On the contrary, He
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50919:22"/>revealeth His ſecret, and augmenteth His light to them, that ſeek His commandments, and are bent to do His will. Let us hold faſt therefore theſe two precious gifts of the LORD, knowledge, and good works; Faith, and Charity; and ſtudiouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us to encreaſe the one by the other; meditating, and learning the myſteries of GOD, that we may obey His will; and obey His will, that we may confirm our ſelves more, and more, in the knowledge of His myſteries.</p>
                     <p>Dear Brethren, That which the Apoſtle hath deſired for His <hi>Coloſſians</hi> is very much, an accompliſhed knowledge of the Divine will, <hi>a life worthy of the LORD,</hi> a ſpiritual ſecondity, <hi>fructifying in every good work,</hi> and a continual advancement in heavenly wiſdom. Yet this is not all. For how great and excellent ſoever theſe things be, they ſuffice not without perſeverance, to conduct us to ſalvation, and it's impoſſible to perſevere in them without a ſupernatural ſtrength, and firmneſs. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth again, in the laſt place, for theſe faithful people, <hi>that they may be ſtrengthened in all might, according to the power of His glory, in all ſuffering and patience of mind with joy.</hi> This ſuccour is neceſſary for us, as well becauſe of our own infirmities, as for the multitude, violence, and obſtinacy of our enemies. For, as to our ſelves, though that celeſtial ſpirit, wherewith GOD baptizeth us at the beginning of our vocation, doth inveſt us with a new vigour; yet ſo it is, that there remaineth much weakneſs in us, while we live on earth; our inward man being yet but in its infancy; a weak age, and which eaſily lets it ſelf ſink, if it be not ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And as for our enemies, we have a vaſt multitude of them, that watch night, and day to deſtroy us, and ranged in diverſe bands, under the enſignes of the Devil, the world, and the fleſh, the principal heads of this black Army, conjured to our ruine, ceaſe not to trouble us, leaving nor wile, nor forcible attempt, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, nor violence, nor threatning, nor promiſe, un-employed againſt us. If we have repulſed one of them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> weak, and oftentimes turn our own weapons againſt us. If we have overthrown avarice, voluptuouſneſs ſets its ſelf on foot. If we defeat it alſo, ambition enters in its place. Hatred unites with it; Deſire of revenge puſheth us on; Wrath provoketh us; Envy ſeizeth us; Perſecution trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth us; Proſperity puſſeth us up; the ſucceſs of our own combats tickleth us. Oftentimes that which helps us on one hand, hurts us on another; as in a complicated diſeaſe, in which the remedies croſs one another: or that which is good for the liver, is dangerous for the Stomach. Who ſeeth not, that to preſerve our ſelves in ſuch a mingled Combate, and againſt ſo many charges ſo confuſed, and ſo obſtinate, (for they laſt as long as our lives) we have need of an extraordinary might, we who of our ſelves have ſo little, that we are inſufficient even for one good thought. But GOD armeth us with the power of His Spirit, as with an impenetrable buckler; under which we ſtand in covert, amid that thick hail of blows, that falls continually about us. It's this Divine power, the Apoſtle wiſheth here to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> when he prayeth, that they might be ſtrengthened in all might; that their ſouls might be confirmed, their hearts hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as a Diamond to reſiſt all aſſaults; their courages veſted with an heroick ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and firmneſs, which all the rages of Hell, or earth, may never be able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. He prayeth they may be ſtrengthened in all might; becauſe as we have to do with divers enemies, and are ſick of divers infirmities, we have need to receive, not one or two kinds of ſtrength only, but many different ones. For even as in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you ſee, the ſtrength of bodies is different; one reſiſting one thing, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another; one having the vertue to repulſe the force of one element, but not to gard it ſelf from another. So in a manner is it in the ſouls of men. Such a man will bravely free himſelf from the tentation of one Vice, that will not be able to defend himſelf from another. Such a man ſhall reſiſt the violences of the world, as will yield to the charms of its careſſes. Since that to loſe a Victory, it is enough to be overcome, though by but one of their enemies; 'tis with great reaſon, that the Apoſtle for preſerving to theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> the honour of their Crown and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, wiſheth them all ſtrength; that is, a perfect ſtrength; which may be of proof againſt all the ſtrokes of the enemy; which may boldly undertake good and holy actions, how high and difficult ſoever they be; which may valiantly combate vices;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50919:22"/>reſolutely deſpiſe earthly things: vigorouſly repell tentations, and generouſly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer afflictions. He ſheweth us alſo by the way the ſource of this heavenly might, when after having wiſhed, that the <hi>Coloſſians might be ſtrengthned in all might,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>according to the power of the glory of GOD;</hi> that is, according to His glorious power; by a manner of ſpeaking ordinary in the ſtyle of the Hebrews. Whence is it, that theſe faithful people do receive this admirable ſtrength, neceſſary for their ſalvation? <hi>From the glorious power of the LORD,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; that is, from that immenſe, and efficacious puiſſance of GOD which nothing can reſiſt. The Holy Spirit is ſo named in St. <hi>Luke,</hi>

<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.16.</note> which in this paſſage he calleth the Vertue, or Power of His glory. <hi>GOD grant you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you may be powerfully ſtrengthned by His Spirit in the inner man.</hi> He calleth this Vertue of the Spirit of God, glorious, to expreſs its admirable, and unſurmountable force, which triumpheth magnificently over all that oppoſeth its action; which with the weakeſt means accompliſheth the greateſt things; which changeth, when it will, Shepheards into Law-givers, and Kings; Cow-heards into Prophets, and Perſecutors into Apoſtles; which beats down the proudeſt fierceneſs, and preſerves invincible the moſt deſpicable weakneſs: which hardneth the bodies of it's humble Warriours, as Steel; maintaineth them in the flames, and confounds with their lowneſs, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Elements, of Men, and of Devils. For this is that the Sacred Writers ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily call glory; even an abundance of beauty, of power, and perfection, ſo rich, as it over-bears our ſenſes; and makes to bend under it, all the vigour of our Spirits, reducing them to admiration, and aſtoniſhment. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſomewhat frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeth this word in this ſenſe; as when he ſaith, that CHRIST was raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father, that is, by His great, and unſpeakable power. Whence it appeareth, that the Vertue which converteth us to GOD, and that which conſerveth us in His grace, is not a common, and ordinary might; but an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble efficacy, which nothing can reſiſt. Seek it not in your own nature, Chriſtian ſoul; ſeek it in GOD, and acknowledging your weakneſs, ask of Him the remedy of it. If it betide you to reſiſt the enemy, and to remain victorious in any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; render all the glory of it to this Soveraign LORD, without attributing ought of it to your ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle ſheweth us in what follows, what is the uſe and effect of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, which the glorious power of the LORD giveth us; <hi>who ſtrengthneth us, unto all ſuffering,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and patience of mind with joy.</hi> Theſe are the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Spirit of GOD in a faithful ſoul, patience, and long waiting, in which principally our ſtrength conſiſteth. Theſe are as the two hands of Heaven, that ſuſtain us in perils, and keep us from ſinking under the weight of thoſe evils, wherewith we often find our ſelves ſurcharged. And though both the two are of a very like nature; yet they have each of them ſomething particular. Sufferance beareth the evil without bending, ſubmitting to it at its inflicting, humbly, and ſtanding firm under this rude load. The Spirit <hi>patient,</hi> or <hi>long-waiting</hi> (for ſo the term uſed here in the Original, doth properly ſignifie) lends it the hand afterward, and attendeth without murmuring for deliverance, from the evil it ſuffers, and for enjoyment of the good it hopeth. Sufferance reſpecteth the very weight, and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the affliction. The long-waiting of the patient Spirit, reſpects the duration of it. Theſe two vertues are abſolutely neceſſary for a Chriſtian: For without them how ſhould he ſupport, either the chaſtiſements of GOD, or the perſecutions of the world? How ſhould he be firm, in the exerciſe of other vertues, to diſcharge the Offices of them, againſt the impediments that thwart them every hour?
<note place="margin">Tertull. de pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</note> Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (ſaith an Ancient) is the Superintendant of all the affairs of GOD, and without it, it is not poſſible to execute His commands, or to wait for His promiſes. 'Tis it, that defeateth all its enemies without toil. Its repoſe is more efficacious, than the motion, and action of others. 'Tis it that makes healthful to us, things, of their own nature moſt pernicious. It changeth for us, poiſons into remedies;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50919:23"/>and defeats into victories. It rejoyceth the Angels; it confoundeth Devils; it overcometh the world. It mollifieth the hardeſt courages, and converteth the moſt obſtinate hearts. It is the ſtrength, and the triumph of the Church, according to the ſaying of the ancient Oracle. <hi>By keeping you quiet, and by reſt you ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; your ſtrength ſhall be in ſilence and in hope.</hi> But the Apoſtle to ſhew us, what this patience is, to which the Spirit of GOD formeth His children, ſaith that it is <hi>with joy.</hi> This is the true Character of Chriſtian patience. The Hypocrite ſuffers ſometimes; but it is murmuring: And the Philoſophers yere while made a great ſhew of their patience: but it was only an effect, either of their ſtiffneſs, or of their ſtupidity; which was no wayes accompanied with the joy, which the Holy GHOST ſheds into the ſouls of thoſe, that ſuffer for the name of GOD. Not that they are inſenſible, or that they receive the evil on them without grief. But if the evil they ſuffer do ſad them, this very thing rejoyceth them; that by the grace of their LORD, they have the ſtrength, and the courage to ſuffer it; and do know, that their ſuffering ſhall turn to their good; and that from theſe thornes they ſhall one day reap the flowers, and fruits of bleſſed immortality. To which may be added the ſweetneſs which is then ſhed into their heart, by the <hi>vive,</hi> and profound impreſſion of that only Comforter, who communicates himſelf to them, on ſuch occaſions, more freely than ever; and can by the ineffable Vertue of His balm, their moſt bitter wounds. This is that, Dear Brethren, which we had to ſay to you, on this Text of the holy Apoſtle.</p>
                     <p>Let us receive his doctrine with faith, and religiouſly obey his voice. He ſheweth us what our task is here below. Let us acquit our ſelves in it with care. GOD of His Grace hath raiſed up among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Let this great Name awaken our ſences, and affections; let it pluck them off from the Earth, and elevate them to Heaven, where He reigneth, who hath given it to us. Let this Name put into our hearts a ſecret ſhame to do, or think ought, that may be unworthy thereof. Faithful Sirs, remember, you are Chriſtians, as oft as fleſh, or earth ſollicits you to evil. Put the world by. 'Tis not to pleaſe it, that you have been regenerated by the Spirit from on high. The World is ſo unjuſt, ſo humorous, and ſo changing, that 'tis impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it. See in what pain, and torment, they continually live that attempt it. And though you ſhould compaſs it, the ſucceſs would coſt you dear. By plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the world, you would diſpleaſe your own Conſcience; the contenting whereof, is infinitely more important to you than any thing elſe. But with GOD it is quite otherwiſe. His will is conſtant, and ſtill the ſame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any variation, or change. Nothing is pleaſing to Him, but what is juſt, and reaſonable. Your Conſcience will find in it, its entire ſatisfaction; and never reproach you, for having ſerved ſo good a Maſter. Not to alledge to you, that the World, after you ſhall have killed your ſelf to ſerve it, will pay you only with ingratitude, and contempt, as experience daily ſhews us; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the LORD will magnificently reward the care, you ſhall have taken to do His will; comforting, and bleſſing you, in this world; Crowning, and glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you in the other. If you demand, what muſt be done to pleaſe Him, the Apoſtle ſhews you in a word. <hi>Fructifie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in every good work.</hi> As often as the LORD ſhall caſt His eyes on this Vineyard, let Him ſee it ſtill laden with good fruits. Let Him never have cauſe to complain of it, as He yerſt did of that of <hi>Iſrael. I expected</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>it ſhould bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</hi> Sure, He hath had no leſs care of ours, than of theirs. <hi>He hath planted it, in like manner, with choice Vines; He hath alſo environed it, with a brave and admirable hedge. He hath watered it, with the rain of His Clouds, and made the beams of His Sun of Righteouſneſs, to ſhine on it, and may juſtly ſay of it, What was there more to be done to my Vineyard, that I have not done to it?</hi> Be we not ungrateful to ſo ſweet a Maſter. Let not our ſterility confound His expectation. Let our fruits be anſwerable to His cares, and our ſecondity to His husbandry. Let there be no ſoul barren, and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50919:23"/>among us, Let each one Fructifie of that He hath: each one improve the dreſſing, and ſap, the LORD hath given us. Let the ſinner preſent Him his repentance; the Juſt, his Perſeverance; the Rich, his Almes; the Poor, his Praiſes; Old Age, its Prudence; Youth, its Zeal. Let the Knowing abound in Inſtruction; the Strong, in Modeſty; the Weak, in Humility; and all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Charity. And ſince it is the good pleaſure of our Heavenly Father, that we have here divers combats; as, none may live piouſly without perſecution; prepare we alſo for this other part of our duty, and ſupplicate the LORD, with the Apoſtle, that He do ſtrengthen us with all ſtrength, according to the power of His glory: that He do give us a firm, and unmoveable patience, to perſevere conſtantly in the Holy Communion of His Son; ſo as, neither the promiſes, nor the threatnings of the World; neither the Luſts, nor the fears of Fleſh, may be ever able to debauch us from His Service. O GOD, our task is great, and we are feeble. Our enemies are Giants, and we but Dwarfes. Therefore thy ſelf work in us, merciful LORD, the work, which thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt us. Perfect thy glorious power, in our weakneſſes. Strengthen our hands, and confirm our hearts; that we may combat vigorouſly, and atchieve great things in thy Name, and after the trials, and tentations of this life, may one day receive in the other, from the Sacred, and Sweet hand of thy Son, the glorious Crown of immortality, which we breathe after. <hi>So be it.</hi>

                     <p>DEar Brethren, Though the firſt Creation of man be a moſt illuſtrious maſter piece of the goodneſs, power, and wiſdom of GOD; this great worker then making <hi>Adam</hi> of the duſt, and forming Him after His own image, to live, and reign on earth in a ſoveraign felicity; Yet it muſt be confeſſed, that our reſtauration of JESUS CHRIST is much more excellent, and admirable. For whether you conſider the things themſelves, which have been given us; or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the quality of thoſe, to whom they have been communicated, or to what the LORD did, for the communicating of them; you will ſee, that the ſecond of theſe two benefits of His doth ſurpaſs the firſt every way. The firſt gave us an humane nature; the ſecond hath communicated to us a divine one. The firſt made us a living ſoul, the ſecond maketh us a quickning ſpirit. By the one we had an earthly, and animal being; by the other we receive a ſpiritual, and heavenly one. The one ſeated us in the garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> the other elevateth us to the Heaven of Glory. There we had a Lordſhip over living Creatures, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Earth; here we have the fraternity of Angels, and the Kingdom of Heaven. There we enjoyed a life full of delight; but infirm, and depending, as that of other living Creatures, on the uſe of meat, and drink, and ſleep: Here we poſſeſs one full of vigour, and ſtrength, which like that of bleſſed ſpirits, is ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its own vertue, without need of other nouriſhment. The one was ſubject to change, as the event hath declared; the other is truly immortal, and immutable, and above the accidents, that altered the firſt. The advantage of the firſt man was, that he might have not dyed; the priviledge of the ſecond is, that he cannot dye. But the difference will appear no leſs, in the diſpoſition of the perſons, to whom the LORD hath communicated theſe benefits; if you attentively conſider it. I confeſs, that duſt which GOD inveſted with an humane form, merited not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſo excellent; and received it from the meer liberality of the Creatour. But if it were not worthy of ſuch a ſavour; at leaſt it had nothing in it, which rendred it uncapable thereof, in the rigour of juſtice; Whereas we, not only have not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the ſalvation, which God giveth us in His Son; but have over and above merited that death, which is oppoſite to it. If the matter, upon which the LORD wrought, in the firſt creation of man, had no diſpoſition for the form, He put in it; ſo neither had it any repugnancy thereto: whereas in our ſecond Creation, that is, in our redemption by JESUS CHRIST, He findeth in us ſouls, ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with His operation, that they potently reſiſt it. So you ſee, that to effect the firſt work, He employed only the ſingle out-going of His will, and word:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50919:24"/>whereas for creating the ſecond, it was neceſſary, He ſhould ſhake the Heavens, ſend down His Son to earth, deliver Him up to death, and do miracles, that aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed men, and Angels. It's with this grand, and incomprehenſible myſterie of GOD, that the Apoſtle entertaineth us, my Brethren, at this time, in the Text, which you have heard. For having finiſhed the <hi>exordium,</hi> that is, the Preface of this Epiſtle; and intending from thence to enter on His principal ſubject; to ſlip the more gently into it; after repreſenting to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> the Prayers, he made to GOD for them; he now adds the thanks; he offered Him, for their common ſalvation; and by this means, opens the entry of his diſpute, touching the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and inexhauſtible abundancy of JESUS CHRIST, for ſaving of believers; which leaves no need of making any addition to his Goſpel. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who,</hi> &amp;c—. As this Text conſiſts of two verſes; ſo it may be divided into two articles. In the firſt, <hi>the Apoſtle giveth thanks unto GOD, for His making us capable of entring into the inheritance of His Saints.</hi> In the ſecond is propoſed, what he hath done to make us capable of this happineſs; namely, <hi>delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated us into the Kingdom of His beloved Son.</hi> Theſe are the two points, we will handle, (if it pleaſe the LORD) in this action: humbly beſeeching Him, to guide us in meditating ſo excellent a myſterie, and touch our hearts, ſo <hi>vively</hi> with it, as that it may effectually further our edification, and conſolation.</p>
                     <p>The benefit of our redemption being very great, and moſt admirable in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, (as we even now intimated) it's with great reaſon, that the Apoſtle begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his diſcourſe of it, by giving of thanks unto GOD. And in his Epiſtles ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, he ſcarce ever ſpeaks of it, but praiſing withall, or admiring the goodneſs of the LORD. He directeth his thankſgiving to the <hi>Father,</hi> as the firſt, and ſupream author of this excellent work. Think not, that he denieth the Son, or the Spirit their part in it; or that he would deprive them of the glory, due to them for it. For ſince theſe three perſons are but one only, and the ſame GOD, it is evident, that the works of the Deity appertain to them all three. But as they ſubſiſt in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order, the Father of Himſelf; the Son of the Father, who generated Him; the Holy Spirit of the Father, and the Son, of whom He proceedeth, from all eternity: ſo likewiſe do they act in the ſame diſpoſition. And foraſmuch as the Father is the firſt, in this order of their ſubſiſtence, and operation; thence it comes, that He addreſſeth His benedictions particularly to Him, as the prime, and the ſoveraign ſource of the Deity from whence originally hath ſtreamed down upon us, all the good, and grace, that we have received, in our redemption. But let us ſee, how the Apoſtle deſcribeth this work of our ſalvation, for which he gives the LORD thanks. <hi>He hath made us capable</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to partake of the inheritance of Saints in light.</hi> After that Sin had made a ſeparation between GOD, and us, it was naturally impoſſible for us, to have part in any of His bleſſings: The LORD therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to ſave us, took care firſt of all to remove this obſtacle of our communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with Him. This He did, ſatisfying His juſtice, by the expiation of ſin, through the death of His Son JESUS CHRIST; and by that means, the liberty of that commerce, between His goodneſs, and our poor nature, which our ſin had interrupted, was opened again: ſo as henceforth nothing hindreth, ſave on mans own part; but he may make his approaches to GOD, and partake of his Grace, through faith, and repentance. Yet this is not the thing, which the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth in this place, when he ſaith, that the Father hath made us capable of having part in His inheritance. For, this grace by which He hath opened the Throne of His beneficence, through the expiation of ſin, doth generally reſpect all men; nor is there any, but acceſs thither is free for him, if he preſent himſelf with faith, and repentance; whereas the Grace, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to him, and the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and ſuch as reſemble them; that is, in a word; it's peculiar to true believers, and not common to all men. It muſt be obſerved therefore in the ſecond place, that beſides this firſt impediment, which did ſhut up the gate of the Houſe of GOD againſt us, to wit, the inexorable ſeverity of His avenging Juſtice; there is yet another, no leſs difficult to be ſurmounted, than the former; though it be of another kind, and a different nature. It is,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50919:25"/>the naughtineſs, the hardneſs, and the blindneſs of our corrupt nature. For as the juſtice of GOD would not permit, that a creature foul with ſin ſhould approach Him, except its ſin were expiated: ſo His wiſdom could not ſuffer, it ſhould finger any of His divine favours, except it repented of having offended Him, and believed His promiſes. But in the eſtate we lye in ſince our fall, our ſoul is ſo depraved by ſin; that it is not capable of its ſelf, either to conſider GOD, or to put affiance in His goodneſs: and ſo this great Miracle of the love of GOD to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us (I mean) the expiation of ſin by the death of His Son) would remain without any ſaving effect, in reſpect of us, if leaving us in the condition we were born, He did but ſimply preſent the declarations of His grace, in external means, to us. For this cauſe therefore, this kind, and compaſſionate LORD, not content to have opened the gate of His bounty, by the Croſs of His CHRIST, doth alſo fetch us up from the grave of our impiety, and gives us the will, and the ſtrength to come to Himſelf. It is properly this ſecond benefit, peculiar to thoſe that believe, which the Apoſtle meaneth here, when he ſaith, <hi>that GOD hath made us capable to partake of His inheritance.</hi> The firſt gift of the Father did capacitate His hand, to communicate His treaſures to us; and the ſecond doth capacitate us to handle them. Without the death of His dear Son, He might not give us life; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s effectual calling, we could not receive it of Him. Faithful Sirs, mark well this leſſon of the Apoſtle: <hi>Who giveth thanks to GOD, for that He hath made us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of partaking of His inheritance.</hi> He firſt brings down thereby the pride of thoſe, that give this glory to free will; boaſting, that they have made themſelves capable of ſalvation; either by ſome kind of pre-diſpoſitions, which oblige GOD, at leaſt by the way of decency, to give them His grace; or by the due uſing and menaging of afflictions: the pride, I ſay, of all thoſe in general, who pretend, that it is in a mans own power, to prepare himſelf for the heavenly inheritance. No, ſaith the Apoſtle, This wholy appertaineth unto GOD. It is He, that hath made us capable.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5.</note> Of our ſelves we cannot ſo much as think a good thought: ſo he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms elſewhere. I confeſs, that this impotency of man is voluntary, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, criminal: it proceeds from the extream badneſs of his heart; and from no defect of any of thoſe things, which are neceſſary, from without, for this effect. (For, what elſe, beſides his own rebelliouſneſs, doth hinder him from believing in GOD, and embracing with repentance, the exhibitions of His grace, which are preſented to him, either in the courſe of nature, or in the Law, or by the Goſpel?) Yet ſo it is, that how voluntary ſoever this His naughtineſs be, it is invincible, and altogether refractory. It is no longer a weakneſs. It's a formed impotency, which nature is not able to correct. And the Scripture ſpeaks of it every where, in this ſenſe.

                        <hi>The carnal man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>cannot underſtand the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD; becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>The affection of the fleſh is enmity againſt GOD.</hi> For it rendreth not its ſelf ſubject to the Law of GOD,

Let us learn then in the ſecond place, to give the LORD alone the whole glory of all that we are, in His Son: as in reality, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to none but Him. He hath not only given us this rich inheritance, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the blood of His Son CHRIST, He hath even given us the capacity to enter into it; and poſſeſs our part of it. Beſides His making us the preſent; He hath alſo given us the ſtrength to receive it. For it is not with the inheritance of GOD, as with the honours of earthly Princes: theſe fall often into the hands of perſons moſt uncapable to poſſeſs them. That Divine honour of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance is given to none but thoſe that are capable of it; that is, who have the conditions requiſite for having part in it, to wit, faith, and repentance. But the ſame GOD, who hath prepared the heritage for us, gives us alſo the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which is neceſſary for entring into it; according to what the Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere.

                        <note place="margin">Joh. 6.45.</note> It's this teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which renders them capable of entring into the communion of His Son, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what He ſaith in St. <hi>John, Whoever hath heard, and learned of the Father,</hi>

                        <hi>cometh unto me.</hi> Thus He made <hi>Lydia</hi> capable of having part in his inheritance, opening her heart to underſtand the things <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, as the ſacred Hiſtory doth report. It's without doubt, in the ſame manner, He alſo made, both St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and theſe <hi>Coleſſians,</hi> and all the reſt of the faithful, capable of the ſame effect, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them within, and leading captive their hearts into the yoke of the Goſpel. In fine, we may again obſerve, how contrary to Apoſtolick doctrine, the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of thoſe is, who vaunt them, of meriting ſalvation. If there be any thing in us, to which merit is attributed, without doubt it is our capacity and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, that we are meet to partake of the Kingdom of GOD. But this very thing is a preſent from GOD, for which we owe Him moſt humble thanks. How then, and by what right can we in juſtice demand pay, and wages for it? Would it not be altogether, as if a patient ſhould enter action againſt his Phyſitian, and compel him to recompence the being cured by his art? Or a poor man demand wages of us for receiving our almes? or a priſoner for having been redeemed with our money? Let a man turn, and transform things, as much as he will; it is clear, that gratification and merit are incompatible; and that He, who is of right obliged to render thanks, cannot, without folly, pretend to have merited, by that very thing, for which he renders thanks. Our ſufficiency, and capacity, is a gift of GOD, or it is not. If it be a gift of His, why pretend you, that it is meritorious? If it be not; why doth the Apoſtle thank our LORD, for having made us capable to have part in His inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? The word, Inheritance, which the Apoſtle employeth here, evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the ſame truth, as an ancient Doctor of the Church hath well obſerved.
<note place="margin">Chryſoſtom. it loc.</note> 
                        <hi>Why is it,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Apoſtle uſeth the word, Inheritance? To ſhew us, that no man obtaineth the Kingdom of Heaven by his own works or performances. But as an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, depends upon happineſs, and not upon merit; ſo is it, in this matter. None can exhibit a form of life, and converſation exquiſite enough, to be worthy of the Kingdom. The whole proceedeth from the gift of GOD.</hi> To proceed; I doubt not, but St. <hi>Paul</hi> took this term from the Old Teſtament: wherein the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> deſtined, and given to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for an inheritance, according to the promiſes made to their Fathers, was the figure of this bleſſed, ſpiritual, and divine life, in poſſeſſion whereof GOD putteth us, by the Goſpel of His Son, beginning it here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by the conſolation, and ſanctification of His Spirit, and reſerving to complete it on high one day, in the Heavens, by the communication of His immortal glory. For as each Iſraelite had his portion in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the ſame in ſubſtance, with the reſt; but diverſly qualified: ſo each believer hath his ſhare in celeſtial life; yet after ſuch a manner, as though, for the main, they all poſſeſs the ſame life; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it is diverſly proportioned, and reliſhed to each of them. Again, as none but the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> had right, and title to that ancient inheritance; So there are none, but the Children of the promiſe, which are born of the word of GOD, and not of fleſh, or of blood, that have part in the new. For this cauſe, the Apoſtle entitles it, <hi>The inheritance of Saints.</hi> Away, ye unbelieving, and profane. It is not for you that GOD hath prepared this glorious inheritance. <hi>Deceive not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50919:26"/>your ſelves.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10.</note> 
                        <hi>Neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor the Effeminate, nor Thieves, nor Covetous perſons, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extertioners, ſhall have part in the Kingdom of GOD.</hi> It is deſigned for Saints alone. The portion of the profane, and ungodly is elſewhere; during this generation, in the world, and in its wretched delights; and when it ſhall paſs away, in the lake of fire, and brimſtone.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle having ſtiled that ſalvation, which GOD communicateth to us in His Son, <hi>the Inheritance of Saints,</hi> addeth further, <hi>in light.</hi> As light is in Scripture the ſymbole of two things, knowledge, and glory; ſo it may be taken here two wayes; either for the knowledge of thoſe divine things, which GOD revealeth in His Goſpel; or for that ſoveraign joy, and felicity whereof we ſhall be ſeized on high in the Heavens. It is beſt, in my opinion to joyn theſe two expoſitions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that we may ſo comprehend the entire ſtate of the whole inheritance of Saints; who after they are once united to JESUS CHRIST, do alwayes live in light; firſt, in that of grace during their pilgrimage on earth; afterwards, in that of glory;
<note place="margin">Rev. 21.23.</note> when they ſhall be raiſed up to that bleſſed City, <hi>which hath no need of the Sun, nor of the Moon; becauſe the brightneſs of GOD hath illuminated it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.5. Phil. 2.15.

                     <p>But it is time, to come to the other verſe: in which the Apoſtle addeth, what the Father hath done, to make us, thus capable of partaking in the inheritance of Saints in light. <hi>He hath delivered us,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from the power of darkneſs, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated us into the Kingdom of His well-beloved Son.</hi> By <hi>darkneſs</hi> the Scripture ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily underſtands, ignorance, and miſery; the two contraries of knowledge, and joy; which it ſignifies by <hi>light,</hi> as we ſaid even now. For ignorance, and error do hide the true, and natural form of things, from our underſtandings; juſt as darkneſs doth wrap up viſible objects, from our bodily eyes. And foraſmuch as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more unpleaſant to men; nor more affrighting, than the obſcurity of darkneſs; thence it comes, that the term is alſo made uſe of, to repreſent horrour, trouble, and miſery. So <hi>the power of darkneſs,</hi> is nothing elſe, but that tyranny, which the Devil, and ſin do exerciſe over their ſlaves, filling their ſpirits with deadly errours, and brutiſh ignorances; and their conſciences, either with affrightment, or inſenſibility; and training them on by little, and little, under this diſmal yoke, into the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of eternal death, which our LORD often calleth, outer-darkneſs, where is weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth. For as knowledge, and truth, is a light, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the attainment of ſalvation; ſo errour, and ignorance infallibly lead to death. Therefore the Devil, the ſworn enemy of our good, blindeth men the moſt he poſſibly can, ſpreading before them groſs, and thick miſts, which hide Heaven, and its bleſſed brightneſs from them. This is the ſumm, of his craft, and ſubtil operation. The deep of his abyſs doth ever vomit forth into our aire, a black va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, for the rendring of our ſenſes uſeleſs. By this means, he turned heretofore, the Nations of the Earth, from the ſervice of their Creator; obſcuring, and ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering by his illuſions, thoſe ſparkles of the knowledge of Him, which they had; and plunging them, and holding them down in ſo deep ignorance, that theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men were not aſhamed,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.23.</note> to adore the work of their own hands, and change the glory of the incorruptible GOD, into the reſemblance, and image of corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed beaſts, and creeping things. As for juſtice, and honeſty of life, this impoſtor had ſo extinguiſhed the lights, which Providence had kindled for them, in their hearts, and ſo diſordered all their knowledge by his ſeductions, that the vileſt abominations paſſed among them for indifferent things. Walking on in ſo thick darkneſs, it is no wonder, if they were in continual fear; they knew not where they went, nor whither they ſhould come; and fell at laſt, after having pittifully ſtumbled, and ſtaggered, into the precipice of eternal perdition.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50919:26"/>And would to GOD, the Prince of errour did not yet ſtill abuſe the world, in the ſame manner! Certainly the darkneſs of the old Paganiſm was not more groſs, nor ſhameful; than that, which covers the greater part of the earth, at this very day. But whereas, that errour, wherein the Devil keepeth men, is called by the Apoſtle, the power of darkneſs, and not ſimply darkneſs, this teacheth us, that that accurſed one worketh effectually in them; doing with their hearts, what ſeemeth Him good; and planting all deceit, and ignorance in them at his will; ſo as theſe wretches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not defend themſelves therefrom. This is one thing, the Apoſtle teacheth us elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; as when he ſaith, <hi>that this evil Spirit now worketh, with efficacy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note>

And all this imperial force he hath upon them, is founded meerly on impoſture, on errour, and ignorance: ſo as, it is with a deal of truth, and elegancy, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it here <hi>the power of darkneſs.</hi> This is, <hi>Faithful Brethren,</hi> the ſad, and pittiful eſtate, in which naturally men lye. Let not the paint, and luſtre, of their pretended wiſdom, and juſtice, dazle your eyes. In the ſight of GOD, it is but darkneſs; whence it comes,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.8.</note> that the Scripture calleth them, darkneſs it ſelf. <hi>Ye were ſometime darkneſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> Judge hereby, how horrible the errour of thoſe is, who dogmatize, that liberty is ſo very natural to man, as they cannot conceive, that they can be men without it. Let them Philoſophiſe upon this ſubject, as they pleaſe. They ſhall never be able to ſhew, that a man can be, all at once, both at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and under the power of darkneſs. He that is under the power of another, is not free. It's GOD alone, that can enfranchiſe men, and take them from this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſervitude, and bind that ſtrong Tyrant, who did hold them Captive. It is to this Soveraign LORD, that the Apoſtle here giveth the glory, both of his own liberty, and of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> theirs.

The moſt adore their fetters; and quit not the darkneſs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and horrours of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but with regret. To fetch them thence, GOD muſt deſcend from Heaven, and take them by the hand, as yer-while <hi>Lot</hi> and his Children. You know, He doth deliver them from this black power of darkneſs, when He diſſipates their errour, and ignorance, cauſing His Sacred truth to ſhine into their hearts, after ſo <hi>vive,</hi> and ſo glorious a manner; as they diſcern it, notwithſtanding all the illuſions of Satan, and the world. Then, the Empire, which this impoſtor exerciſed over them, vaniſheth away. They wonder, how ſo weak clouds could hide from them, ſo reſplendent a light; and this new flame, or to ſay better, this new Sun, diſcovering to them the true countenance of things; the falſe colours, wherewith the Devil, and the Fleſh endeavour to diſguiſe them, have no more force upon them. They then ſee, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and nakedly, the turpitude, and horrour, of idolatry, of ſuperſtition, and of Vice: and on the other ſide, clearly perceive the verity, the beauty, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of piety, and ſanctity.</p>
                     <p>This deliverance is abſolutely neceſſary, for having part in the inheritance of Saints: unto which none is received, who is not a child of light, and hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the ſervitude of errour, and of vice. And I profeſs, it is much, to have ſhook off the yoke of darkneſs, and be gone forth from its power. Yet this is not all. If the LORD ſhould ſtop there, we, for all this, ſhould have no ſhare in the divine glory of the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> It is of abſolute neceſſity for admiſſion there, that we bear the marks of the Lamb, and at our going out of darkneſs, enter into His Holy light. For this cauſe, the Apoſtle after he had ſaid, <hi>that the Father hath
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50919:27"/>delivered us from the power of darkneſs,</hi> immediately addeth, <hi>and tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his well-beloved Son.</hi> For though, in effect, theſe two benefits of GOD are inſeparably joyned together; yet notwithſtanding they do conſtitute two different graces. It is his goodneſs, and not their nature, that hath thus tyed them each to other. Had not the counſel of His love otherwiſe ordered, it might have come to paſs, that a man ſhould be delivered from the power of darkneſs, and yet not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of His Son; but remain in ſuch a liberty, as <hi>Adam</hi>'s was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fell. But now, ſince no man hath remiſſion of His ſins, without becoming a member of JESUS CHRIST by Faith; and ſince all that have this honour, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtined, by the good pleaſure of the Father, to be conformed to the image of their head, and conſequently to have part in His Kingdom, and Glory; there muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, be entring into his Kingdom, or an eternal abiding under the power of darkneſs. The Apoſtle, by the <hi>Kingdom of the Son of GOD,</hi> means that very thing, which the Evangeliſts ordinarily call, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, <hi>the Church of our LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> that bleſſed City builded by the miniſtry of the Apoſtles, and Prophets upon the Son of GOD, it's only, eternal, and unmoveable foundation, the ſtate of the Meſſiah; the new republique of GOD, His royalty, and prieſthood. It is very pertinently, that he calleth it here, <hi>the Kingdom of the Son of GOD:</hi> becauſe the inheritance of Saints, being the matter in hand, which none but a child of GOD can have part in; this informeth us, that we may not obtain this right and title, but in the Kingdom of JESUS CHRIST alone; ſince none but He the true, and proper Son of GOD is able to convey divine adoption to us: and it is for a like reaſon, that He ſtileth Him <hi>the well-beloved Son of GOD;</hi> even to the end we might confidently hope for all the grace, and glory, which the Father promiſeth us: inaſmuch as we pertain to His wel-beloved, Him in whom He is well-pleaſed; whom He ſingularly affecteth, and as perfectly as Himſelf; His eternal delight, and love. Beſides I doubt not, but the Apoſtle had ſome aim to heighten the grace, which the Father hath ſhewed us, by this apt, and clear oppoſing of the Kingdom of His well-beloved Son, into which He hath tranſported us, to that power of darkneſs, the Empire of His enemy, from which He hath delivered us. GOD brought us into this bleſſed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when He gave us the faith of His Goſpel, the righteouſneſs of His Son, and the conſolation of His Spirit, ſigning us with the badges of His Houſe, and ſealing us with His holy Baptiſm. But the word tranſport, or tranſlate, which the Apoſtle uſeth, repreſents alſo the ſtrength and vertue of this action by which GOD hath brought us into the Communion of His Son. I acknowledge, the operation of this grace of His, is ſweet, and pleaſant: for it perſwadeth, it gaineth the heart, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with the very great joy of him, that receives it: But withall it is potent, and efficacious. Nothing can reſiſt it. There is no rebellion, nor hardneſs of heart, but it ſubdueth;

                     <p>This is that, Beloved Brethren, which we had to deliver you, for the expoſiton of this Text. I wiſh, that the ſame ſpirit which yerſt indited it to the pen of the Apoſtle, would pleaſe to engrave it in the loweſt depth of our hearts, with the point of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, in uneffaceable Characters; that we might have it day, and night before our eyes: that we might carefully peruſe it, and conſult it, in all the occurrences of our life! This meditation would ſuffice, to conſerve in a conſtant, and happy exerciſe of Chriſtian piety, and to guard us from all, that diſturbeth our ſanctification, or our comfort. Firſt, it would enflame us with an ardent love of GOD, and excite us to a ſprightful, and ſincere acknowledgement of His benefits. For what love, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and what ſervices do we not owe to this Soveraign LORD, who hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to diſplay ſo much mercy, and goodneſs upon us? who hath called us, from that eternal death, wherein we were ſunk with the damned, unto the poſſeſſing of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of His Saints? Who hath made us meet to enter into the fruition of His light? Who by a miracle of His power, and wiſdom, hath plucked us from the yoke of the Devil? hath delivered us from the unrighteous, and murtherous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darkneſs, and to compleat His graces, hath tranſlated us into the bleſſed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Son of His dear love? Who from brands of Hell, that we were, hath changed us into live, and lightſome Starrs, in His Firmament? of dead doggs, hath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50919:27"/>made us firſt-fruits of His Creatures; and from ſlaves of Demons, transformed us into Angels, and from the accurſed ſtate of Satan, raiſed us to the Sacred Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of His Son; to be henceforth His free-men, His brethren, and His members? O love! O goodneſs incomprehenſible! How have we the heart to offend ſtill, a LORD ſo charitable, ſo admirable? How is it, that His ſo divine beneficence doth not tranſport our ſpirits? doth not win to His ſervice all the thoughts, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and motions that we have? Chriſtians, all the acknowledgement He demands of you, for ſo much good done you, is but that you live holy. Refuſe Him not ſo juſt, and ſo reaſonable a due. He hath made you to partake of the inheritance of Saints; Be not ye ſo ingrateful, as to mix with the profane. Be ye ſeparate from them, and have no communion with the impurity, and ordure of their vices. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> the title you have to ſo precious an inheritance; Let it be dearer to you, than all the periſhing proviſions, and delights of the earth; none of which is better, than that pittiful pottage of <hi>Lentils,</hi> for which the profane man did truck away His birth-right. This inheritance is in light. Live then, as children of light. Let your converſation be all radiant with thoſe divine, and heavenly vertues, which the Goſpel of your Saviour recommendeth unto you. The darkneſs is now paſſed. The Sun of righteouſneſs is at his full height. Let that infamous power of darkneſs, under which you ſometime groaned, have no more authority over you. Open all your underſtanding, that you may perceive the glory of the LORD; and ſuffer no more abuſe by the illuſions of errour. Labour to encreaſe your light, being ſtill at the Scriptures of GOD, the living ſpring of all ſpiritual illumination; the inexhauſtible treaſure of ſaving knowledge. But let this light ſhine alſo in your manners: For it's to no purpoſe, to renounce the darkneſs of ſuperſtition; if you remain in that of vice.

                        <hi>He that hateth his Brother,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John) is in darkneſs, and walketh in darkneſs, and knoweth not whither he goeth; for darkneſs hath blinded his eyes.</hi> Remember, you are no longer in the School of Satan, the Prince of darkneſs. You are in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Son of GOD. Have thoughts, and do actions, worthy of ſo glorious a condition. Let it purifie your life of all ſtench, and ſordidneſs. Let it elevate your hearts above mortal things, and ſet them in Heaven, the reſidence of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine royalty. But, Dear Brethren, as this Text doth oblige us to a ſingular ſtudious purſuit of Sanctification; ſo openeth it to us a living ſource of conſolation, and joy. For if we knew our bleſſings, and that wonderful grace which the Father hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, what were there more happy than we? We have part in the heritage of Saints. The kingdom of the beloved Son of GOD hath been given us. O great, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent portion! Let the world boaſt of, and adore, its gold, its honours, and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, as much as it liſteth: we have that better part, which alone is ſufficient to make us eternally happy, though we ſhould be deprived of all the reſt. Chriſtian, if the world bereave you of what you have in its fee, and juriſdiction; conſider, it cannot take from you the inheritance of Saints. If it deny you its Leeks, and Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Fleſh-pots; it ſhall not be able to debarr you, from that divine light, which ſhineth on you, and which, in ſpight of all its attempts, ſhall conduct you to your bliſs-ful <hi>Canaan.</hi> If it take from you its honours, if it drive you even out of its earth, it ſhall not be able, to wreſt the Kingdom of the Son of GOD from you, nor ſequeſter that dignity, and glory, which you poſſeſs in it. This is not a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Kingdom; it's not like thoſe of the earth, that are ſubject to a thouſand, and a thouſand diſgraces, miſeries, and mutations. It's an immortal Kingdom, firmer than the Heavens; ſo abundant in glory, and in goodneſs, that it changeth all thoſe, who have part in it, into Kings, and Prieſts. Faithful Brethren, content we our ſelves with ſo advantageous a portion. Let us enjoy it for the preſent by a lively, and an eſtabliſht hope, ſweetly bearing the incommodities of this ſmall journey we take, to get to it, and patiently expect that bleſſed day, on which our Heavenly Father, having finiſhed the work of His grace, will raiſe us all up into His glory, and put on our heads, the crownes of life, and immortality, which he hath promiſed us in the eternal Communion of His well-beloved Son. <hi>To whom with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, the true, and only GOD, bleſſed for ever, be all honour, and praiſe, to Ages of Ages.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>DEar Brethren, As the true, and thorough knowledge of that great Redeemer, whoſe remembrance we are at this day to celebrate, is the only foundation of the piety, and ſalvation of men: in like manner on the contrary, ignorance of His perſon, of His offices, and of His benefits, is the ſource of thoſe errors, and abuſes, which have corrupted religion, and conſequently, of that unhappineſs, into which the unbelieving, the profane, the ſuperſtitious, and the heretical, do fall. We may ſay to all theſe people;
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.10.</note> as our LORD ſometime did to the woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, If you knew, who He is, that ſpeaks to you, in our Goſpel, you would ask of Him, the refreſhment, and conſolation of your ſouls; and He would give you living water,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.8.</note> 
                        <hi>ſpringing up to everlaſting life.</hi> And as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the ancient Jews; <hi>that if they had known the wiſdom of GOD, they would never have crucified the LORD of glory.</hi> So may we ſay, to all the enemies of Godlineſs in general; that if they knew JESUS, the Wiſdom, and Word of the Father, they would not wrong, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther His truth, or thoſe that make profeſſion of it. JESUS, rightly, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, believed, and apprehended, is enough to expell errour, doubt, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, vice, and death, from our hearts; and to eſtabliſh truth, peace, joy, holineſs, and ſalvation, in them. Accordingly you ſee, that <hi>Paul,</hi> the maſter of the whole world, the Miniſter of truth, the teacher of life, and happineſs, for the executing of this high commiſſion, and opening the eyes of His gentiles, and bringing them from the power of Satan unto GOD, proteſteth, he determined to know nothing among them, but JESUS CHRIST Crucified. He findeth, in this rich, and inexhauſtible ſubject, all that was neceſſary for him, to convert Infidels, to confirm believers, to comfort the afflicted, to reduce the ſtrayed, and recover ſuch as had erred. He finds in it, wherewith to confute the Philoſophy of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, wherewith to abaſe the preſumption of the Jews, wherewith to inſtruct the ignorant, and to convince the intelligent. It's with the ſole ſcience of this JESUS, that He plucketh men off from idolatry, and ſets them free from the ſlavery of vice. It's with the ſame again, that he reformeth the abuſes, and cureth the wounds which errour hath cauſed in the Church. It is his weapon, againſt enemies without, and againſt the ſeditious within. It's with this Science he buildeth the Houſe of GOD; it is with the ſame alſo, that he cleanſeth, and keepeth it pure. Whatever the enemy be, that appears, he ſets againſt him nothing at all, but his Crucified JESUS. For even as in nature, no ſooner doth the Sun appear in our horizon, opening its beautiful, and brightſome viſage to the world, but the ſhade, and cloudineſs, that filled the air, doth immediately vaniſh away; ſo in the Church, when the LORD JESUS ariſeth in the hearts of men, there ſhedding abroad the riches of His ſaving light, and ſhewing His fairneſs to open view; at the ſame inſtant, errour and abuſe do diſappear, being
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50919:28"/>unable to ſuſtain the force of this divine brightneſs: and as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſings on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion; <hi>If He ariſe His enemies are diſperſed, and they that are againſt Him, flee before Him. He driveth them away, as wind doth the ſmoke.</hi> This then is the only aſſured means, either to preſerve, or recover truth, and the purity of heavenly doctrine, even to propoſe JESUS CHRIST inceſſantly to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and diligently ſhew them, all His riches, all His Vertue, and His Grace. This is the Apoſtle's method. Thus he doth on all occaſions, ſtill reducing his Schollars to JESUS CHRIST. So you ſee in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that he might put-by the ſhadows of the Jewiſh Law, wherewith ſome of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion endeavoured to darken the Goſpel; he ſheweth them, at the beginning, the majeſty, and divinity of the LORD JESUS, ſetting Him up above men, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, on the Throne of a ſuper-eminent glory. Thus he doth in this Epiſtle, and indeed, he combateth here a like errour. For after he had ſaluted the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and given them ſome tokens of the affection he bore them, as you heard afore, he now beginneth to ſpeak to them of JESUS CHRIST, diſcovering His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory, and the fulneſs of His goodneſs, to them; that being content with ſo rich a treaſure, they might not go beg, either the ſuccour of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the aſſiſtance of Philoſophy, for the ſaving of their ſouls. It is preciſely at the Text we have read, that he beginneth this excellent diſcourſe. For having before thanked GOD for the grace, He had ſhewed the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> in tranſlating them into the Kingdom of His well-beloved Son, he takes occaſion from thence to ſpeak of Him, adding, <hi>In whom we have deliverance by His blood,</hi> to wit, <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> This is the great benefit, we have received from GOD, by means of JESUS CHRIST. Then he deſcribeth, in connexion herewith, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and divinity of His perſon, <hi>Who is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the image of the inviſible GOD, the firſt-born of every creature.</hi> But, for this time, we will content our ſelves with the firſt point, the meditating whereof, as you ſee, My Brethren, is very ſuitable to the action of the Holy Supper, to which we are invited; wherein, the remiſſion of ſins, which we have in JESUS CHRIST, is ſealed to us by His Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; wherein the blood, by which He hath purchaſed it, is repreſented, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us; wherein JESUS, the Author of this benefit, is pourtrayed before our eyes, as broken, and dead for us, and as feeding us to everlaſting life. Lift we up then our hearts, with religious attention, that having rightly comprehended, both the greatneſs of the grace of GOD, and the excellency of His CHRIST, we may preſent Him, ſouls lively affected, with ſenſe of His goodneſs; and may receive, in conſequence of it, that joy, and bleſſed life, which He promiſeth to all thoſe, that ſhall approach Him, with ſuch a diſpoſition. To aid you in ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a meditation, I will examine, if the LORD pleaſe, what the Apoſtle teacheth us, concerning the benefit, which we receive of God, in His Son, ſaying, that we have in Him deliverance by His blood, to wit, the remiſſion of Sins.</p>
                     <p>In theſe words, he briefly pointeth out, who is the Author of deliverance even JESUS CHRIST; what is the deliverance it ſelf, namely, the remiſſion of ſins; what the means is, by which JESUS CHRIST hath obtained it for us, even by His blood; and laſtly who they are, that receive it from GOD, namely, we: that is to ſay, <hi>the Faithful.</hi> He had ſaid afore, that GOD hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated us into His Kingdom. Now he ſheweth us, by whom, He effected that great work, adding, that we have deliverance in JESUS CHRIST. He is the Author of our redemption, our only deliverer, the Prince of our ſalvation. But whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, that it is, in Him, we have deliverance, this may be taken two wayes, both of them good, and commodious: Firſt, as ſignifying, that it is by Him, we have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. For it is an <hi>Hebrew</hi> manner of ſpeech, frequent in Scripture, to ſay, <hi>in,</hi> inſtead of, <hi>by.</hi> And, after this ſenſe, the Apoſtle declareth, how it is, by JESUS CHRIST His Son, that GOD hath accompliſhed the work of His good pleaſure towards us, having conſtituted Him the Mediator of mankind; who according to the will of Him that ſent him, perfectly executed all thoſe things, that were neceſſary to put us in poſſeſſion of ſalvation. But this word, <hi>in,</hi> may alſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50919:29"/>be taken in the ſenſe it hath in our vulgar language, as ſignifying our ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the LORD, by reaſon whereof we are ſaid to be in Him, and He in us.
<note place="margin">1 Jo. 2.2.</note> For though He be the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, and the worth of His ſacrifice ſo great, as that it abundantly ſufficeth to expiate all the crimes of the univerſe; and although the ſalvation obtained by Him, be offered in effect, and by His will, unto all men: yet none actually enjoy it, but thoſe, that enter into His communion, by Faith, and are in him by that means; as that clauſe of His covenant expreſly importeth,
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> 
                        <hi>GOD hath ſo loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoſoever believeth in Him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Jo. 5.12.</note> When it is, that St. <hi>John</hi> proteſteth aloud, <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life; He that hath not the Son of GOD, hath not life;</hi> which is as much, as if He had ſaid, He that is in JESUS CHRIST, hath life; and he that is not in Him hath not life; according to what our LORD Himſelf ſaid to His Apoſtles.
<note place="margin">Joh. 15.3.</note> 
                        <hi>Out of me, ye can do nothing.</hi> So you ſee, this ſence is good, and clear, and containeth an excellent doctrine; That to enjoy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by JESUS CHRIST we muſt be in Him. Nevertheleſs, becauſe the Apoſtle, in this place, deſigneth to ſhew us, what the LORD hath done for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, rather, than what He requireth of us, for our participating thereof: I would more readily take the words, the firſt way, <hi>in whom,</hi> that is, <hi>by whom, we have deliverance.</hi> And this indeed is the commoneſt expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the moſt and beſt Interpreters, both ancient, and modern do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>Let us next conſider, what the benefit of GOD is, which we have by JESUS CHRIST. It is <hi>Deliverance,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. The word he uſeth in the Original,
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> particularly ſignifieth a deliverance, effected by ſome ranſom, given for bringing the delivered, out of the baſt eſtate, he was in; and it is properly that, which we call <hi>Redemption.</hi> For a man may be delivered divers wayes, either by being ſimply put out of the affliction, he was in; as when a maſter enfranchiſeth his ſlave, ſetting him at liberty, of His good will: or when a Creditor lets his Debtor out of priſon, forgiving him the debt: or by exchange, as when one priſoner of War goes for another: or by forcible recovery, as when <hi>Abraham</hi> delivered <hi>Lot,</hi> by defeating his enemies, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> his people, that had been taken by the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> The deliverance, we have by JESUS CHRIST, is not of this ſort. He hath procured it, by the ranſome, He gave for us; and it's this, that the word <hi>Redemption,</hi> here uſed by the Apoſtle, doth ſignifie. But the ſame term informeth us alſo, that the benefit, which we have received of Him, is not ſimply the gift of life. It is a deliverance; which brings us out of ſome miſery. GOD gave life, and immortality to the Angels; but He gave them no deliverance, ſince they never were in ſin, or miſery; and before <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, He promiſed Him life, it's true; but not ſalvation, and redemption; becauſe man was then in his integrity, without ſin, and miſery, likewiſe. The benefit, we receive of Him by JESUS CHRIST, is not ſimply life, and immortality; it is a deliverance, a ſalvation, a redemption, that not only conferreth ſome good on us; but taketh us out from ſin, and freeth us from miſery. The Apoſtle explains it us more particularly, when he adds, <hi>That this redemption, which we have in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, is the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> True it is, the word, <hi>Redemption,</hi> is general, compriſing under it deliverance, from any evil whatſoever; certain it is alſo, that the number of our evils is great, and that JESUS CHRIST hath delivered us, not from one, or two evils only; but from all. He hath delivered us from the ignorance, into which we were naturally plunged. He hath delivered us, from the bondage of the Fleſh, the luſts whereof did exerciſe an horrible ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in our members. He hath delivered us from that death, which we were made ſubject unto, and from the curſe of the Eternal Father, which we had deſerved. For which cauſe, the Apoſtle elſewhere ſaith, that JESUS CHRIST is made unto us, not ſimply <hi>righteouſneſs:</hi> but alſo <hi>wiſdom, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and redemption;</hi> and in a multitude of places, <hi>that He hath brought us out of darkneſs, and delivered us, from the (tyrannous) power of ſin and death.</hi> But
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50919:29"/>though all this be very ſure; yet, in this place, he reſtraineth, the Redemption, we have in JESUS CHRIST, to the remiſſion of ſins; and that, in my opinion, for two reaſons. Firſt, becauſe remiſſion of ſin is the firſt, and the principal of His benefits; the baſis, and foundation of all the reſt; which neceſſarily leads them on, and without which, it is not poſſible to reach any of them. For ſin, as you know, is expreſly that, which makes ſeparation between GOD, and us. The cauſe, why this moſt merciful, and all-powerful Ruler of the world, taketh from us, the light of His knowledge, and the communication of His goodneſs, leaving us in the darkneſs of errour, and in miſery, is neither hatred, nor contempt, nor diſdain of His creatures. It's nothing, but our Sin, His juſtice, and ſoveraign equity permitting Him not to crown, with His bleſſings, people that are criminal. JESUS CHRIST therefore intervening, and procuring for us the remiſſion of our ſins, thereby bringeth us out of the ill caſe we were in; and openeth the fountain of celeſtial good, which was before ſhut up by Juſtice. This obſtacle being removed, this ſluice (if I may ſo ſay) opened, Divine goodneſs, recovering its natural courſe, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth upon us, and poureth into us light, peace, holineſs, and life. It is not then, to exclude theſe other benefits of the Redemption, which is by JESUS CHRIST, that the Apoſtle defineth it hereby, the remiſſion of ſins; (For it compriſeth them all; none having this remiſſion, but they have alſo, upon it, all the LORD's other graces:) but to ſhew us the due order of all the parts of this deliverance; of which, remiſſion of ſin is the firſt, and principal. Secondly, the Apoſtle doth this, becauſe the ranſome which the word, Redemption, doth imply, was not properly neceſſary, ſave for obtaining the remiſſion of ſins. Except for this, there was no need, that JESUS CHRIST ſhould lay down His life for us. For ſuppoſing, that a pure, and ſinleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould have lain in ignorance and miſery, and, if you will, even in death it ſelf. There would have been no neceſſity, that the Son of God ſhould have ſhed His blood, or ſuffered death, to bring it up thence. It would have ſufficed, He had loved it. His good will would have immediately moved His power, to diſplay it ſelf, in its behalf, and fetch it out of its diſtreſs; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder this natural operation of His goodneſs; and ſo the happineſs of ſuch a creature would have been ſimply a deliverance, and not a redemption. But foraſmuch as we were ſinners, it was neceſſary for our recovery, that JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST ſhould make His ſoul an offering for ſin, and pay the ranſome of our liberty. Whence it follows, that to ſpeak properly, and exactly, there is nothing but the remiſſion of ſins, that ſhould be called redemption, as the Apoſtle defineth it in this place; the other deliverances, which we obtain by our LORD, being only fruits, and conſequents of the remiſſion of ſin. This then is the grand atchievement of the Son of GOD, the miracle of His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and love, that He hath procured, and obtained for us, the remiſſion of our ſins. This is our true redemption. Without this redemption we ſhould ſtill be enemies of GOD. We ſhould not have any part, either in His grace, or in His glory. Be even what you can deſire, in other reſpects; Have all the goods of the earth, all perfections of body, and mind; Be Monark of the whole world; Have (if it were poſſible) the lights of Angels, and the riches of their knowledge: If you have not the remiſſion of your ſins you are a bondman, and a wretch; a ſlave to Devils, and vanity, and death; ſince true redemption is the remiſſion of ſins. But as without it, it is impoſſible to be otherwiſe, than infinitly wretched; ſo with it, it is not poſſible, to be otherwiſe, than infinitely happy. The repoſe of the conſcience, the illumination of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the jewel of ſanctification, the Graces of the celeſtial ſpirit, life, and immortality, do inſeparably follow it. <hi>Go in peace</hi> (ſaid the LORD JESUS to thoſe whoſe ſins He pardoned) as if He had ſaid, thou haſt nothing more to fear, ſince thy ſin is forgiven thee. There is no longer, either evil, that can hurt thee, or good, that can be denyed thee, if it be profitable for thy ſalvation. Away with that cruel, and extravagant doctrine, which will have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50919:30"/>it, that GOD remitteth the fault, without remitting the puniſhment. This is to oppoſe even natural ſenſe, and common reaſon: For what is it to remit a ſin, ſave to puniſh it not, and treat him, that committed it, as if He had not been culpable? This is to give the Apoſtle the lye, who proclaimeth, both elſewhere, <hi>That there is no condemnation to them,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                        <hi>that are in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> and here, that the remiſſion of our ſins is a redemption. For if GOD puniſhed the faithful, as is pretended, He would do it, after having condemned them to ſuffer: ſince being moſt juſt, He neither puniſheth, nor abſolveth any, without judgement. And if notwithſtanding our remiſſion, we eſcape not burning in the pretended Purgatory fire, how is our remiſſion a redemption? Is this to ranſome a criminal perſon; to make Him be burned? I grant, the faithful after this remiſſion obtained, are not freed from divers afflictions during their temporal abode here below. But I affirm that their ſufferings are exerciſes or chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not properly puniſhments of their ſin. The LORD ſends 'em them, not in His wrath, but in His grace; not to puniſh them, but either to amend them, or to prove them, and render them conform to the image of His Son, who was conſecrated by afflictions, in the dayes of His fleſh. Such is this remiſſion of ſins, the redemption we have in JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>Let us now ſee, by what means He hath obtained it for us. <hi>The Apoſtle teacheth it us,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>That we have it by His blood.</hi> We have already ſaid, how the word, <hi>Redemption,</hi> here uſed, doth ſignifie, that our deliverance was effected, by the payment of a ranſome. This he expreſly noteth elſewere, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

<note place="margin">Rev. 5.9. Act. 20.28.</note> 
                        <hi>when they gloriſie the Lamb, for that He hath redeemed them to GOD by His blood;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Acts, that GOD hath purchaſed the Church by His own blood.</hi> By theſe paſſages, and a multitude of others of like import, it is evident, that the Apoſtle, both in this place, and in the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where He repeats the ſame words, <hi>by the blood of CHRIST,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the violent death, He ſuffered on the Croſs with effuſion of His blood; which He did ſhed forth in great abundance, through the wounds of His feet, of His hands, and of His ſide. And it's a thing common in all languages to ſignifie <hi>life, by blood, and the loſs of life by effuſion of blood.</hi> But the Holy Ghoſt particularly uſeth this manner of ſpeaking, when there is reference to a Sacrifice. For in ſuch caſes, the blood of the Victime is almoſt alwayes put for the life it loſeth, when offered: ſo as it need not be thought ſtrange, that theſe divine authors ſay, <hi>the blood of CHRIST,</hi> (who is the only Lamb, and moſt perfect oblation, which all the old Sacrifices did typifie) when they mean, the life, He ſpent for us on the Croſs; offering it to the Father, as the propitiation for our ſins. This now, is the great myſterie of the Goſpel; which was not known to men, or Angels; nor could have been ever thought on, or conceived by any, but the ſupream, and infinite wiſdom of GOD: that JESUS CHRIST the wel-beloved of the Father, the moſt Holy one, ſhould lay down His life for us, be ſet in our ſtead, and bear our ſins in His own body on the tree, and ſuffer in His ſacred fleſh, and in His moſt holy ſoul, the pains, and ſorrows we had merited, to exempt us from them.</p>
                     <p>It's this preciſely, that we mean, when we affirm; that He ſatisfied the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of GOD for us. And the Apoſtle, in theſe words, furniſheth us, to preſerve
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50919:30"/>this glory to our LORD, againſt two ſorts of adverſaries: one, of them that impudently deny His having ſatisfied for us at all: another, of thoſe, who grant His ſatisfaction, but do extend this honour unto others alſo, and will have it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain likewiſe to Saints, and even to our ſelves. As for the firſt, they deſerve not to be accounted Chriſtians; ſince they reject a truth, ſo cleerly, and ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſſerted in the Goſpel, confeſſed by all the Church; and which beſides, is the ſource of our comfort, both in life and death: and the only foundation of all our hopes. For if JESUS CHRIST ſatisfied not for us, what mean the Prophets, and Apoſtles, who proclaim at the beginning, in the midſt, and at the end of all their Preaching, <hi>that He dyed for our ſins,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.3. Iſa. 53.5, 10. Rom. 3.24. Joh. 1.29. Heb. 9.27, 28. &amp; 10.10. &amp; 1.3.</note> 
                        <hi>was wounded for our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and bruiſed for our iniquities? That the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon Him, and by His ſtripes we are healed? that His ſoul was made an offering for ſin? That He is our propittaion, through faith in His blood? That He is the Lamb of GOD, which taketh away the ſins of the world? That He offered up Himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, and ſanctified us by this oblation, and purged away our ſins by Himſelf?</hi> I omit, at preſent, other places, the number whereof is infinite, Theſe are ſufficient to ſettle the truth. For firſt, ſince our deliverance is called a Redemption, it muſt needs be, that JESUS CHRIST hath purchaſed it for us, by ſome ranſome, He gave in our behalf. But He gave none at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in dying, He laid out His life, and His blood for us, and in our ſtead. Again, if it be not thus, why ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>it is by the blood of CHRIST, that we have the remiſſion of our ſins?</hi> If it be not a ſatisfaction for our ſins, 'tis evident, it's of no uſe at all, to obtain us the remiſſion of them. In this caſe, we ſhould have it, not by the blood, or death of CHRIST, which, after this account, would have contributed nothing thereunto, but by the ſole goodneſs, either of GOD, or of His Son. For to ſay, that the remiſſion of ſins is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the blood, and death of our LORD, becauſe He, by dying, ſealed the truth, of what He preached, in His life; this is evidently, to mock the world. His miracles alſo confirmed His doctrine, and yet neither Scripture, nor any wiſe man, ever ſaid, that we have remiſſion of ſins by His miracles, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here, and elſewhere often, that we have it by His blood, and by His death. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if this reaſon muſt take place, ſince the Martyrs ſuffered to ſeal the ſame doctrine, it may be alſo ſaid, that we have redemption, and remiſſion of ſins, by their blood, which is not read at all. On the contrary, the Apoſtle vehemently denies, that either himſelf, or any other, was crucified for us, but CHRIST alone. Theſe reaſons do deſtroy another ſhift theſe people uſe; to wit, that we have ſalvation by the death of JESUS CHRIST, becauſe in dying, He gave us example of patience, and perfect obedience. For by this account, the Martyrs, whoſe ſufferings had in them the like patterns, ſhould have ſaved us as well as CHRIST. We add, that patience, and obedience do conſtitute part of our ſanctification; whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, we have in JESUS CHRIST, by His blood, the remiſſion of ſins, and not ſimply ſanctification. What they ſay, for a third evaſion, is no better: that CHRIST hath acquired by His death the right of pardoning ſins. For either their meaning is, that the LORD hath rendred ſin remittable, by the ſatisfaction He hath made for it; or they ſimply intend, that CHRIST obtained, by His death, the power of pardoning ſins, which He had not before. If they anſwer, the firſt, they grant us the very thing that we demand. If the ſecond, they do thwart the Goſpel, which teſtifies, that our LORD often remitted ſins unto men, while He lived; and ſaid expreſly, that He had authority on earth to forgive them. In fine, that, which deſpair of ſo bad a cauſe ſuggeſteth to them, in the laſt place; is of no more validity; namely, that the remiſſion of our ſins is attributed to the death of CHRIST, becauſe it preceded His reſurrection, the glory whereof lighteth up faith, and repentance in us, the true cauſes of that remiſſion. But they cannot produce any one example of ſo ſtrange a manner of ſpeaking: and to ſay, that the blood of CHRIST waſheth away our ſins, becauſe the effuſion thereof pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded His reſurrection, the cauſe of that faith, by which we obtain the pardon of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50919:31"/>them; this is as much, or more abſurd, than if you ſhould ſay, that it's by the darkneſs of the night, we are enlightned, by day; becauſe the light of the Sun, which then ſhineth on us, had the darkneſs of the night preceding it. After this account, the remiſſion of our ſins ſhould be everywhere attributed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of CHRIST JESUS, to His aſcenſion up to Heaven, and to the miracles of His Apoſtles, and not to His Death; whereas quite contrary, it is ever conſtantly referred to the death, to the blood, and to the Croſs of the LORD, as to its true cauſe, and not ever to His reſurrection. For as to that, which the Apoſtle ſomewhere ſaith, <hi>viz. that CHRIST roſe again for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> his meaning is, not that our ſins obliged Him to riſe, as they had obliged Him to dye,
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.25.</note> according to what he had affirmed, <hi>that He was delivered for our offences:</hi> but that He might apply to men the fruit of His death, in juſtifying them by the Vertue of His blood; therefore was He raiſed from the grave, and crowned with higheſt glory: this being neceſſary, for the production of thoſe divine effects in the world. Say we then, that the LORD, by pouring out His blood, and His life on the Croſs, did truly ſatisfie the avenging Juſtice of the Father, undergoing for us, and in our room, that death, which we deſerved: and without this laid down, there can be no rational aſſerting, what the Apoſtle ſaith here, and in divers other places, to wit, that we have remiſſion of ſins, in JESUS CHRIST, by His blood.</p>
                     <p>But from the ſame Apoſtolical aſſertion, it is alſo very evident, that none other, but our LORD alone, is capable of ſatisfying for us. For ſince the remiſſion of ſins, is our Redemption, who ſeeth not, but that if any one procure it for us, he muſt be our Redeemer? a title, which, by the unanimous conſent of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, appertaineth ſingly to JESUS CHRIST. Moreover, it's by the blood of our LORD, that this remiſſion hath been purchaſed: ſo as, neither <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Cephas,</hi> nor any other, having been Crucified for us, it likewiſe followeth, that no one of them hath, either ſatisfied GOD for us, or merited the remiſſion of ſins.

Never did the ſword of GOD ſpare any, but for the ſake of this blood. St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth it us in this Text, and it's the laſt particular we have to obſerve upon it. For when he ſaith, <hi>We have redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, by His blood,</hi> he intends not to ſpeak ſingly of himſelf, and the <hi>Coloſſians:</hi> but of all the faithful, that were on earth, and even of thoſe, that had lived, from the beginning of the world, unto that time. There neither was, nor ever had been ſalvation in any other, but in Him. And as ſin, and death deſcended from <hi>Adam</hi> upon all men; ſo the righteouſneſs, and life of all the faithful cometh from JESUS CHRIST.
<note place="margin">Rev. 13.8. Heb. 9.15.</note>

His blood is the remiſſion of the ſins, both of the one, and the other people. It's being to be ſhed in due time, gave it the ſame efficacy, for the generations, that preceded His Croſs; as it had afterwards, by its actual effuſion, in thoſe that ſucceeded it. GOD the Father, appeaſed by this ſacrifice, ever preſent in His ſight, as well before, as after its oblation, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the fruit, and merit of it, that is to ſay, grace, and remiſſion, to all thoſe, that believed in Him, under the one, and the other Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>Behold, Beloved Brethren, that which we had to ſay to you, concerning the Redemption, we have in JESUS CHRIST. The Text of the Apoſtle teacheth it us, and the table of the LORD repreſenteth it to us. This is the myſterie of the bread, we there break, and of the cup, we there bleſs, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50919:31"/>and for the communicating, of that ſacred body, which was broken for us, and of that divine blood, which was ſhed, for the remiſſion of our ſins. Let us carefully improve a doctrine ſo neceſſary, and which is ſo diligently inculcated on us, in the word, and in the Sacraments of our LORD, referring it to our edification, and comfort. Learn we from it, firſt, the horrour of ſin; a ſpot ſo black, as could not be waſhed out, but by the blood of JESUS CHRIST. That remiſſion of it might be given us, it was neceſſary, the Father ſhould deliver up His dear Son to dye, and the Son give His blood, the preciouſeſt jewel of the univerſe, a thouſand times more worth, than heaven, and earth, and all the glory of them. From this meditation, conceive a juſt hatred againſt Sin; ſince it is ſo abominable in the eyes of this Soveraign LORD, on whoſe communion alone depends all your bliſs, ſhun it, and pluck it out of your Conſciences, and your hearts. As for ſins already committed, ſeek the remiſſion of them, in the blood of CHRIST. Give your ſelves no reſt, till you have found it; till you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained grace; till it be exemplified in your ſouls, by the hand, and ſeal of the Holy Ghoſt. Lay by the pretended ſatisfactions, and merits of men. Have no recourſe, but to the righteouſneſs of JESUS CHRIST, which alone is able to cover our ſhame, and render us acceptable to GOD. But having once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained pardon for the time paſſed, return not into it, for the future. When ſin ſhall preſent it ſelf to you, repell it couragiouſly; oppoſing to all its temptations, this holy, and healthſome conſideration. It's my Maſter's the murtherer of the LORD of glory; It's the accurſed Serpent, that ſeparated man from GOD, that put enmity between Heaven, and earth; that ſowed miſery and death in the world; and obliged the Father, to deliver up His Son, to the ſufferings of the Croſs. GOD forbid, I ſhould take into my boſome, ſo cruel, ſo deadly an enemy.</p>
                     <p>But from this ſame ſource, we may alſo draw unſpeakable conſolation, againſt the gnawing guilt of ſin, and the troubles of Conſcience. For ſince, it's by the blood of the Son of GOD, that we have been redeemed, what cauſe is there to doubt, but that our remiſſion is aſſured? The ſuperſtitious hath reaſon to be in continual affright; ſince man, in whom he puts his confidence, is but vanity. The propitiatory, I preſent you, Faithful ſoul, is not the blood of a man, or of an Angel, creatures finite, and incapable of ſuſtaining the eternal burnings of the wrath of the Almighty: It is the blood of GOD's own Son, who alſo is Himſelf, GOD bleſſed for ever. It's a blood of infinite value, and truly capable of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-poiſing, and bearing down the infinite demerit of your crimes. Come then, ſinner, whoever you be. Come with aſſurance. How foul ſoever your tranſgeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be, this blood will cleanſe them away. How ardent ſoever the diſpleaſure of GOD againſt you be, this blood will quench it. Only, bedew your ſoul with it. Make an aſperſion of it on your hearts, with a lively faith, and you ſhall no more need to fear the word of the executioner of the avenges of GOD.</p>
                     <p>But, Faithful Brethren, having thus aſſured your Conſcience, by the meditation of this divine blood of our LORD; admire ye alſo His infinite love, which He ſo clearly ſheweth us, and confirmeth to us. This King of Glory hath ſo loved you, that when your ſins could not be pardoned, without the effuſion of His blood, He would dye upon a Croſs, rather than ſee you periſh in Hell. He poured out His blood, to keep in yours; and did undergo the curſe of GOD, that you might partake in His bleſſings. O great, and incomprehenſible love! the ſingular miracle of Heaven; which raviſheſt men, and Angels! What ſhould we fear henceforth, ſince this great GOD hath ſo loved us? Who ſhall condemn us, ſince He is our ſurety? Who ſhall accuſe us, ſince He is our Advocate? He hath given us His own blood; What can He any longer refuſe, to beſtow on us? He hath laid down His ſoul for us, how much more will He grant us all other things, that may be neceſſary for our ſalvation? But as this thought doth comfort us, ſo ought it to ſanctifie us. Of what Hells ſhall not we be worthy, if we love not a LORD, who hath ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loved us? If we obey not His commandments, who hath blotted out our ſins? If for this precious blood, which He hath given us, we do not render to Him ours,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50919:32"/>and conſecrate to His glory a life, which He hath redeemed, by the offering up of His own in ſacrifice, for our ſalvation? And after an example of ſo raviſhing goodneſs, how can we be ill affected to any man? Chriſtians, GOD hath forgiven you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and a thouſand moſt-enormous ſins; how have you the heart to deny your neighbour the pardon of one ſlight offence? He hath given you His blood, you, that were His enemy; How can you refuſe a ſmall almes, to him that is your Brother, and that upon the account, both of nature, and grace? Let the goodneſs of the LORD JESUS mollifie the hardneſs of your heart; let the vertue of His blood melt your bowels into ſweetneſs, into charity, and into love both toward Him, and towards His members. Diſcharge you, this very day, at His table, of all the bitter paſſions of your fleſh. Put off there pride, hatred, and envy: and clothe you there with His humility, and His gentleneſs. Do him new homage; and give Him oath, to be never any others, but His alone; preſenting your ſelves with deepeſt reſpect, before this Throne of His grace. Remember, both at this time, and ever after, that blood, by which He hath obtained Redemption for you, that is, <hi>the remiſſion of your ſins.</hi> This blood is the peace of Heaven, and of earth. This blood hath brought us out of Hell, and opened Paradiſe unto us. It hath delivered us from death, and given us life. This blood hath blotted out the ſentence of our curſe, that ſtood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in the Law of GOD, it hath ſtopped the mouth of our accuſers, and pacified our Judge. This blood hath effected a renovation of the world. It hath quickned the dead, and animated the duſt, and changed our mortal fleſh into a celeſtial, and divine nature. Dear Brethren, GOD forbid, we ſhould tread under foot, a thing ſo holy; or account ſuch precious blood profane or common. Let us reverence it, and receive it into our hearts, with an ardent devotion. And may it diſplay its admirable efficacy in them, cauſing the royal image of GOD, even ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and righteouſneſs, to flouriſh there, to the glory of the LORD, and our own conſolation, and ſalvation. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>DEar Brethren, As the ſalvation of mankind, the true end of the coming of our LORD JESUS CHRIST into the world, did oblige Him to expiate ſin, and deſtroy the Dominion of Satan: ſo the performing of theſe great works, did require an infinite dignity, and power, in His perſon. For as it was not poſſible, He ſhould give us eternal life, without voiding our guilt, and ſatisfying the juſtice of the Father, and delivering us from the hold of Devils; ſo it was alike impoſſible, that He ſhould perfect theſe effects, without an infinite merit, and a divine ſtrength; that is to ſay, without being GOD; none but a true GOD being capable of having an infinite, either dignity, or power. As then the ſtreams conduct us to their ſpring; branches to their ſtock, and root; the houſe to the foundation, that ſuſtaineth it. So the ſalvation, which is of the LORD JESUS, leadeth us to the acts, by which He obtained it for us: and from thence, to the quality, that was neceſſary in His perſon, for the executing of thoſe acts. Salvation is the fruit of this tree of life. The infinite merit of His croſs is as the branch, that bore this noble fruit, and His almighty, moſt holy, and moſt divine perſon is the ſtock, or root, that did ſhoot forth this beautiful, and bleſſed branch. This order, the Apoſtle obſerves here, in the conſideration of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. He ſets forth to us, firſt, His fruit, that is, our ſalvation, or redemption; the laſt end of His whole mediation. Next He repreſents the means, by which He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired this ſalvation, for us, to wit, the effuſion of His blood, for the remiſſion of our ſins: from thence He now aſcendeth to the Quality of His perſon, which he magnificently deſcribeth, in the Text, that you have heard, ſaying, <hi>that He is the image of the inviſible GOD, the firſt born of every creature; foraſmuch as by Him all things were created.</hi> Wonder not, Faithful Brethren, that JESUS ſhould give us life, and eternity, Us I ſay, poor ſinners, that had deſerved death, and the curſe of GOD. For He purchaſed remiſſion of our ſins, by His blood; and did, by the ſweet ſavour of His ſacrifice, perfectly appeaſe the wrath of GOD, which alone withſtood our entring into His heavenly Kingdom. Neither account it any more ſtrange, that this JESUS, ſo infirm, cloathed with frail fleſh, ſubject to all our ſufferings, ſhould be able to offer ſo great, and ſo precious a ſacrifice to GOD. For how weak, and deſpicable ſoever that form was, under which He appeared here below, He is nevertheleſs in reality, the true Son of GOD, His wiſdom, His word, and His power; the perfect pourtrait of His perſon; His living, and eſſential image, the ſoveraign Lord, and Creator of the Univerſe.</p>
                     <p>In this deſcription of the dignity, and excellency of the LORD JESUS, the Apoſtle compares Him, firſt, with GOD the Father, ſaying, <hi>that He is the image of the inviſible GOD.</hi> In the ſecond place, with the Creatures, ſaying, <hi>that He is the firſt-born of them,</hi> and adds the reaſon of it, in the two following Verſes; which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50919:33"/>is taken from His having made, and eſtabliſhed them all, as their Creatour, their preſerver, their laſt, and higheſt end. Afterwards He finally propoſeth the relation He hath to the Church ſaying in the eighteenth verſe, that He is the Head thereof, the beginning, and the firſt-born from the dead, having the firſt place in all things. In theſe three points the ſoveraign dignity, and excellency of the Saviour of the world, is, as you ſee; compriſed. But becauſe it would be difficult, to explain them all three in one only action; the richneſs, and profoundneſs of the matter conſtraineth us, to fix for this time, on the two firſt, and remit the remainder to another ſeaſon. We ſhall then have to handle, in this exerciſe, the two heads, that are contained in the verſe, which we have read. One, that JESUS CHRIST is the image of the inviſible GOD; the other, <hi>that He is the firſt-born of every creature.</hi> The ſame LORD, who ſhall be, by His grace, the ſubject of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, pleaſe to be the direction, and light thereof too; inſpiring us with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and expreſſions worthy of Him; illuminating our underſtandings with the knowledge of His high, and ſupereminent Majeſty; and enfl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ming our hearts with a fervent love to Himſelf, for the glory of His own great Name, and our ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt Head, the Apoſtle telleth us two things in it; the one, <hi>that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the image of GOD:</hi> the other, <hi>that the GOD, whoſe image JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is, is inviſible.</hi> For underſtanding aright, how the LORD JESUS is the image of GOD, we muſt obſerve at the entrance, that the word, <hi>image,</hi> is of great extent, ſignifying generally every thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents another: ſo as things being very variouſly repreſented, it comes to paſs, that there is great variety, and difference of images. Some are perfect, which have in them an entire, an exact, and adequate reſemblance of the ſubjects, which they repreſent: others are imperfect, and expreſs but ſome particular, nay, that too with ſome defect: having not properly in them the ſame features, and ſame eſſence which is in their original. I place, in this ſecond rank, all artificial images, whether drawn by Painters; or engraven, or cut by Carvers, or faſhioned by Founders; or woven by Embroiderers, and workers of Tapiſtry; which repreſent nothing, but the colour, the figure, and the lineaments of men, and animals, and plants, and ſuch like ſubjects; and, to ſay true, have nothing in them of their life, and nature. To this ſame order muſt be reduced, that which <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth; that <hi>Adam</hi> was made after the image of GOD. It's not to be thought, he had ſuch an eſſence, as that of GOD is: but this is ſaid, becauſe the conditions of His na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ſome reſemblance, of the properties of GOD: namely, in that He was endowed with intellect, and will: and had the dominion over animals, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creatures. In the ſame manner muſt we take, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the two ſexes of our nature,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.7.</note> he termeth the man, <hi>the image, and the glory of GOD; whereas the woman is the glory of the man.</hi> He calleth the man, the image of God, becauſe of the advantage, and ſuperiority he hath over the woman; having nothing above himſelf, but GOD, who is His head: whereas man is the head of the woman, becauſe ſhe was created of him, and for him, as the Apoſtle teacheth. But beſide theſe kind of images, which repreſent their originals but imperfectly; there are others, that have a perfect reſemblance of them. Thus we call a Child, the image of His Father; a Prince, the image of His Predeceſſour. For a Son hath not meerly the ſhadow, or the colour, or the figure of his father; he hath his nature, his qualities, and properties, and, if we may ſo ſay, the whole fulneſs of his being; a ſoul, a body, a life, the ſame with thoſe, his Father hath. A Prince, in like manner, hath not only the ſhadow, or the appearance of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and power of his Predeceſſor. He hath the whole ſubſtance, and reality of it.
<note place="margin">Gen. 5.3.</note> Thus it is, that <hi>Moſes ſaith,</hi> Adam <hi>begat</hi> Seth <hi>his ſon, in his own likeneſs, and after his image.</hi> He ſignifies thereby, that <hi>Seth</hi> had a nature, the ſame in all things, with <hi>Adam</hi>'s own. Now the queſtion is, in which of theſe two ſenſes, muſt we take the word, <hi>Image,</hi> when the Apoſtle ſaith here, and alſo elſewhere, <hi>that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the image of GOD.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> The very quality of the ſubject in queſtion, ſheweth us ſo clearly, that we muſt apprehend it after the ſecond way, and not the former; as even thoſe that quarrel it, dare not ſay, that JESUS CHRIST
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50919:33"/>is, an imperfect image of His Father. For where is the Chriſtian ear, that could ſuffer a blaſphemy, ſo horrible, and ſo contrary to all the Scripture? Sure, when the Apoſtle ſaith of our LORD, that He is the image of GOD, he thereby meaneth quite another thing, then what he ſignifies elſewhere, when he ſaith, that man is the image of GOD. For intending here, to exalt the LORD JESUS, and to demonſtrate, that His dignity is ſo high, as capacitateth Him to ſave us; He would ill ſuite this deſign, if he attributed nothing to Him, but what agreeth to any man, whoever he be. And yet if you do not underſtand it, that JESUS CHRIST is a perfect image of GOD; the Apoſtle will affirm no other thing, of Him here, then he aſſerts elſewhere of man, when he ſaith, <hi>he is the image of GOD.</hi> Beſide the Apoſtle's end, the thing it ſelf he ſpeaks of, doth evidently ſhew it us alſo. For our LORD informeth us, <hi>that He who hath ſeen Him, hath ſeen the Father;</hi> and that;
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.9. &amp; 12.45.</note> 
                        <hi>who beholdeth Him, beholdeth Him, that ſent him.</hi> Where is the pourtrait, of which it may be ſaid, that he who hath ſeen it, hath ſeen the ſubject, which it repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? It's clear, this is not found, but in ſuch an image, as is moſt perfect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth fully in it, all the being of its original. Whence it appears, that it is in this ſenſe, <hi>that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the image of GOD.</hi> And to make us conceive it the better, the Apoſtle hath a paſſage, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the ſcope, the terms, and ſenſe whereof, have very much reſemblance with this here; there he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> 
                        <hi>that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the reſplendency of the glory of His Father, and the Character, or engraven Stamp of His perſon.</hi> Terms exceeding elegant, and expreſſive, and ſuch as clearly decide this caſe, <hi>that the LORD is the image of GOD,</hi> in another manner, than man; and that the ſame glory, which ſhineth in the Father, is reſpendent alſo in the Son; and that the ſame nature, which is in the perſon of the one, is likewiſe in the perſon of the other. Say we therefore, according to the Analogie of this Doctrine, and the reaſon of the thing it ſelf. That JESUS CHRIST is the image of GOD His Father, but a perfect one; yea the moſt perfect, that an image may be. An image, which exhibiteth unto us, and repreſenteth, not the colour, or the ſhadow, but the truth, and ſubſtance of the Deity. The Scripture, our only guide in theſe high myſteries, teacheth it clearly. And to aid you, in the comprehending of it; though the GOD-head be moſt ſimple, in it ſelf, exempt from all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and compoſition; yet ſpeaking of it, according to the weakneſs of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to which GOD hath not diſdained to accommodate Himſelf in His word, we will conſider three things of Him; the nature, the properties, or qualities (which Divines commonly call, His Attributes) and His works.</p>
                     <p>As for His Nature, it is moſt perfectly repreſented in JESUS CHRIST; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as He hath really, and veritably, the ſame being, and ſame ſubſtance; with GOD the Father. As a child, whom we call, the image of His Father, hath the ſame nature with Him, being truly of mankind, as He. The Scripture teacheth us this truth, in very many places; where it ſaith,
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.5. Tit. 2.13. Rom. 9.5. 1 Cor. 10.9. Joh. 12.41.</note> that JESUS CHRIST is GOD; that He is the true GOD. Our great GOD, and Saviour. GOD bleſſed above all. Jehovah, yerſt tempted by the Iſraelites in the deſart. He whoſe glory, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw in the viſion deſcribed, at the ſixth Chapter of His Prophecy. It layeth down the ſame thing alſo, as often as it repreſents Him to us a due object of our adoration; ſaying, that all ought to honour Him, as they honour the Father;
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.23. Heb. 1.6.</note> and that the very Angels worſhip Him: it being evident, that according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, there is nothing, but a nature truly divine, to whom adoration may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully given.</p>
                     <p>But the LORD JESUS no leſs perfectly repreſents the Father, in His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, then in His Nature. The Father is eternal; ſo is the Son; and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Him upon this account, The Father of eternity. Before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, He is.
<note place="margin">Joh. 8.58.</note> He was from the beginning with GOD; and before the world was created, even then He was in the boſome of the Father, His love, and His delight. The Heavens ſhall periſh, but He is permanent. The Heavens ſhall wax old as a garment, and be folded up as a Veſture, and be changed. But JESUS is the ſame,
<note place="margin">Heb 1.11, 12.</note> and His years ſhall not fail. The Father is immutable, without ever receiving any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50919:34"/>or change,
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.8.</note> either in His being, or in His will. The Son is the ſame, both yeſterday, and to day, and for ever. The Father is infinite, filling Heaven, and earth: neither is there any thing within, or without the world, that boundeth the preſence of His being.
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.13.</note> The Son is in like manner infinite. He is in Heaven, whiles He ſpeaketh to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> on earth. He is here below on earth, in our hearts, and in our aſſemblies, the ſame inſtant, that He is fitting at the right hand of the Father, in the higheſt room of the Univerſe: and though the Heavens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that body, and humane nature, which He did aſſume: yet they do not encloſe His Majeſty, and all-preſent Divinity. The Father hath a ſoveraign underſtanding, knowing all things, preſent, paſt, and to come. The Son is Wiſdom it ſelf. He knoweth all things; and if He ſay ſomewhere, that He knoweth not the day of Judgement, this is not to be underſtood, but in reſpect of His humane nature, and not in reſpect of His divine intelligency.
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.23.</note> 
                        <hi>He ſoundeth the reins, and knoweth the heart of man;</hi> a quality which the Scripture noteth to us, as the character, and ſpecifique mark of the knowledge of GOD, aſſerting, that there is none but He only, who knoweth the hearts of men. The Father knoweth Himſelf, and no man, or Angel, to ſpeak properly, ever ſaw Him. The Son ſo perfectly knoweth Him, that He hath even declared, and revealed Him unto men. The Father is almighty, and doth whatſoever He will. The Son hath all power in Heaven, and in Earth, and there is nothing but is facile to Him. The Father is ſuper-eminently good, hating evil, and loving rectitude and juſtice. The Son is the Saint of Saints, entirely ſeparate from ſinners, goodneſs, and juſtice it ſelf. The Father is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and inclined to pity. The Son is the bottom of His compaſſions. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maketh His Sun to ſhine on, and His Rain to bedew, even the men that blaſpheme Him. The Son dyed for His enemies, and prayed for thoſe that crucified Him. In ſhort, the Father hath not any other eſſential quality, but the Son hath it likewiſe, and in the ſame meaſure, with the Father.</p>
                     <p>I come to His Works. Certainly the Son Himſelf informeth us, how perfectly He repreſents the Father in this reſpect:
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.19.</note> ſaying in general, that <hi>what thing ſoever the Father doth, the ſame doth the Son likewiſe.</hi> The Father created the Univerſe. The Son founded the Earth,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.10. Joh. 1.3.</note> and the Heavens are the work of His hands. <hi>All things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made of all that was made.</hi> The Father conſerveth the world by His providence; the Son ſuſtaineth all things by His mighty word. The Father hath ſet up the Princes, and Magiſtrates, who govern man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
<note place="margin">Prov. 8.15.</note> and there is no power but of Him. It's by the Son, that Kings Reign, and Princes decree juſtice. The Father ſaved, and redeemed the Church; the Son is our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, our wiſdom, and our redemption. The Father loved us, and delivered up His Son to death for us; the Son gave Himſelf a ranſome for our ſins. If the Father raiſed up the Son; the Son alſo raiſed again His own Temple, when the fury of the Jews had beaten it down. If the Father quicken the dead, the Son quickneth them likewiſe; and the laſt judgment, the puniſhing of the wicked in Hell, the glory of the Faithful in Heaven, and all, that refers to it, is the work, both of the one, and the other. The Father hath elected us; ſo likewiſe hath the Son.
<note place="margin">Joh. 13.18.</note> 
                        <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>whom I have choſen.</hi> It is the ſame in all the other actions, and operations of the divine nature. If you read the Scriptures exactly, you ſhall not ſee any of them attributed to the Father, but is likewiſe attributed to the Son. And as for that right, and ſoveraign authority, which accreweth unto GOD, over all things, from theſe great, and high qualities, and operations, this glory ſhineth in the perſon of the Son, as it doth in the perſon of the Father. If the Father be Judge of the earth, King of ages, and Monarch of the world; the Son is in like manner, the LORD of glory, the head of the Armies of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the Prince of men, and Angels; the Judge of all fleſh. If the Name of the Father be great and dreadful, that of the Son is above every name, which is named in this world, or in the world to come. If all creatures, both ſuperiour, intermedial, and inferiour, do owe a ſoveraign homage to the Father, and caſt down themſelves before Him, adoring His Majeſty, with the profoundeſt reſpect, they are capable of: ſo it is clear, that before JESUS every knee doth bow, both of things in Heaven, and things on earth, and things under the Earth, the Father Himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50919:34"/>when He bringeth Him into the world, <hi>Let all the Angels of GOD worſhip Him.</hi> So you ſee, Dear Brethren, that the LORD JESUS is truly the image of His Father, ſince He hath, and diſcovereth perfectly in Himſelf, the Nature, the Properties, and the Works of the Father. An admirable, a ſingular, and a truly Divine image, which poſſeſſeth the whole form of its original, without any varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and faithfully, and naturally repreſenteth all the features of it, in their true, and juſt greatneſs, meaſure, and nature. I confeſs, there are among men, ſons, that reſemble, in ſome ſort, their Fathers: but there are none, in whom ſuch reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance is comparable with that of the Son of GOD to His Eternal Father. If our Sons repreſent our nature, and manners, it is always with ſome difference, which a piercing, and a clear-ſighted eye may eaſily obſerve; and after all, there are none, that in their life, do expreſs the lives of their fathers totally entire, with every one of their actions, and operations. Whereas the Son of GOD is a moſt complete image both of the nature, and the life of His Father, (if we may ſpeak in this manner of theſe myſteries) all the works of the one, whether ſmall, or great, being alſo the works of the other.</p>
                     <p>This ſacred Verity, taught here by the Apoſtle, overthroweth two hereſies, which, though contrary, and oppoſite to one another, did ſometime equally trouble the Church of GOD. I mean, that of the <hi>Sabellians,</hi> and that of the <hi>Arians.</hi> The former confounded the Son, with the Father; the latter rent them on ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Thoſe took from the Son His perſon; theſe His nature. For the <hi>Sabellians</hi> did dogmatize, that the Father, and the Son were but one, and the ſelf-ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who according to the divers wayes, and ends of his manifeſtations did aſſume, ſometimes the name of Father; ſometimes the name of Son. So as in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is the Father, who ſuffered on the Croſs; and it's the Son, who ſent, Him that ſuffered. St. <hi>Paul</hi> breaketh their errour, by ſaying, <hi>that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the image of the Father,</hi> For no one is the image of himſelf, and how great and exact ſoever the image's reſemblance of its original be, it's of neceſſity, that it be another ſubſiſtence than its original. A child hath the ſame nature, with the Father, whoſe image it is ſaid to be: but nevertheleſs the perſon of the Father is one, and that of the child another. Since then the Apoſtle declareth here, and elſewhere, <hi>that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the image of GOD,</hi> (that is to ſay, of the Father) we muſt either deſert His doctrine, or acknowledge that JESUS CHRIST is another perſon than the Father. But if you diſtinguiſh their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it doth not follow, that you muſt divide their nature, as did the <hi>Arians;</hi> who made it their poſition, that the nature of the Father is another, than that of the Son: the one increated, and infinite; the other created, and finite. Theſe are two ſhelves, which we muſt equally avoid, ſteering our courſe ſtraight in the midſt; ſhunning on one ſide, the confuſion of <hi>Sabellius;</hi> and on the other, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Arius. JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is the image of GOD His Father.</hi> He could not be the image of Him, if He were one ſame perſon with Him. He could not be His Perfect image, if He had a nature differing, from the nature of the Father. How ſhould He repreſent His eternity, if He had been crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in time? How His immenſity, if He had a limited eſſence? How His Majeſty, and glory, if He were but a creature? Let us then hold faſt this truth, full and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; and believing, that the Son of GOD is another perſon than the Father; let us confeſs, that His Divine nature is the ſame, with that of the Father: that is to ſay, that He is one only, and the ſame GOD with Him, bleſſed for ever: ſince without this, the doctrine of the Apoſtle, <hi>that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the image of GOD,</hi> cannot be fully, and firmly eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>But let us now conſider, how, and why, he here termeth GOD the Father, whoſe image JESUS CHRIST is, <hi>inviſible.</hi> Sure the Divine nature is ſpiritual; as our LORD ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria, that GOD is a ſpirit;</hi> And every ſpiritual nature is inviſible; it being clear, that the eye ſeeth no objects, but ſuch as are corporeal; ſuch as have ſome figure, and colour; and do caſt forth from them, ſome kind of ſpecies, into the air, and into other diaphanous, and tranſparent bodies; through which they gliding with incredible ſwiftneſs, come to ſtrike our ſenſes; things theſe, that have, none of them, any place, in ſpiritual, and immaterial
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50919:35"/>ſubſtances. For this cauſe, <hi>Moſes,</hi> when He would yer-while teach the Iſraelites, that GOD had nothing groſs, or material in His eſſence: nothing that might be repreſented by the workmanſhip of the pencil, or the chizel, in viſible images; doth expreſly remonſtrate to them, that on the day He manifeſted Himſelf, giving them the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 4.12. Deut. 4.15, 16.</note> they heard indeed a voice ſpeaking, but ſaw no likeneſs at all, beſide that voice. Whence he concludeth, that they ſhould take good heed, they made no graven image, or likeneſs, repreſenting any kind of thing; no effigies of any form whatſoever, to be of religious uſe to them, as a pourtrait of GOD; as moſt Nations then did, and to this day ſtill do. This truth is clear, and undoubted; nor was it ever conteſted, but by the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to GOD an humane body, and members; an extravagancy, long ſince condemned, and aboliſhed, in all Chriſtendome. But the Apoſtle here terming GOD inviſible, doth not meerly intend, that neither our eyes, nor our other ſenſes can apprehend the form of His nature. He ſignifieth alſo, that our very under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings cannot comprehend it, and that it is hidden from all our conceptions. For it is frequent in Scripture to put <hi>ſeeing,</hi> for <hi>knowing,</hi> and to ſignifie the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and conceptions of the mind, by the names of the ſenſes of the body. And it is thus, we muſt take, what the Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere, <hi>that GOD, the King of ages,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.16.</note> 
                        <hi>is inviſible:</hi> and in another place, <hi>that He dwelleth in inacceſſible light;</hi> and that, <hi>no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee Him.</hi> The Angels themſelves, how high ſoever their underſtanding be above ours, yet cannot comprehend the true form, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of this ſupream, and moſt glorious Majeſty; becauſe His eſſence is infinite, and no finite ſubſiſtence is capable of conceiving an infinite being. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Seraphim,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 6.2.</note> in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſtanding before GOD, covered their faces with two of their wings; to teſtifie, that they could not bear the ſplendour of His glory. I grant, that through His grace, we do know ſomething of His nature; and it's this the Scripture meaneth, when it ſaith of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and other believers, that they ſaw, and beheld Him, more, or leſs, according to the divers degrees of the knowledge. He gave them, of Himſelf; the higheſt of which degrees will be that, we ſhall attain unto, in the Kingdom of Heaven; and the Holy GHOST, to expreſs it to us,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2. 1 Cor. 12.12.</note> ſayeth, <hi>that we ſhall ſee GOD, as He is; that we ſhall ſee Him face to face, and know Him, as we were known.</hi> But how fair, and clear, and excellent ſoever all this knowledge be, which faithful men, and holy Angels have of GOD, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world, or in the other; it is not to ſpeak ſtrictly, a ſeeing; that is an apprehenſion, which reacheth, and conceiveth: the true, and proper form of it's object: ſo as this remains ſtill firm, that GOD, to ſpeak properly, <hi>is inviſible.</hi> But why doth the Apoſtle aſcribe this quality unto GOD the Father, particularly in this place? Dear Brethren, he doth it very pertinently; and thereby ſheweth us, how it is by JESUS CHRIST His Son, that GOD hath manifeſted Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us. For there is a ſecret oppoſition between the word <hi>image,</hi> and <hi>inviſible. GOD is inviſible,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the image of Him.</hi> This eternal Father hath a nature ſo ſublime, and ſo impenetrable by any ſenſe of ours, that without this His image, which ſhines forth in His Son, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, nor Angels would have known ought of Him; He had remained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally veiled up, in that inacceſſible light, in which He dwelleth, without being known of any, but Himſelf. But now He hath vouchſafed, to manifeſt unto us, that which may be known of Him, by this eternal, and moſt perfect image of His perſon, that is to ſay, by His Son. For firſt, it is by Him, He made the world, the Theatre of His wonders. And it's by Him alſo, He conſerveth it, and governeth it, in ſo admirable a manner. It is to Him likewiſe, that we muſt refer the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of GOD, under the Old Teſtament. It's the Son (as moſt of the ancient Doctors of the Church have very well obſerved) that appeared unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarchs; that led <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the wilderneſs, and inſpired its Prophets. But the Apoſtle, in this paſſage, hath reſpect particularly, and propery, to the manifeſtation of GOD in the fulneſs of time, when his eternal, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial image did diſcover all His glory, to the Jews firſt, and afterwards to the other Nations of the world, rendring it, of inviſible as it was in it ſelf, viſible in that fleſh, which He veſted Himſelf with, in the Bleſſed Virgins womb. It was then
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50919:35"/>properly, that the Son appeared before our eyes, as He is in reality from all eternity, the image of the inviſible. GOD, the reſplendency of His glory, and the engraven mark of His perſon. For the office of an image is to repreſent that to us, which it is the figure of. Now it was principally, in this laſt manifeſtation, that the Son made us ſee all the wonders of His Father; the abyſſes of His juſtice, and of His mercy; the depths of His wiſdom, and His infinite power, which the world knew not before. The Creatures of this univerſe do ſhew us, only the edges, as it were, and the footſteps, and the bigger lincaments of them; JESUS CHRIST hath unfolded, and laid open to our view, the whole ſubſtance, and form of them. The world, and the Law it ſelf, were but imperfect draughts, and obſcure ſhadows. JESUS CHRIST is that enlivened image, in which the Majeſty, the nature, and the goodneſs of GOD do appear, with all their fulneſs.</p>
                     <p>But it is high time now, to come to the other point, wherein the Apoſtle, having compared JESUS CHRIST with GOD His Father, of whom he is the image, conſidereth Him with reſpect to the Creatures, and expreſſeth the relation He hath to them, by ſaying, <hi>that He is the firſt-born of every Creature.</hi> This paſſage hath diverſly exerciſed the Hereticks. Thoſe of them, who deny, that the Son of GOD ſubſiſted at all in nature, before His being born of the Holy Virgin, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that theſe words place Him before all the Creatures, to ſalve their errour, do corrupt the word <hi>Creature,</hi> and will have it ſignifie, in this place, the faithful, that believed the Goſpel of our LORD. Wretched unbelief, to what extravagancies doſt thou lead miſerable men! For, what deliration can produce, a thing more empty within, and even leſs apparent without, than this expoſition? Firſt, it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the Apoſtles conception, frigid, and impertinent. If you believe theſe people, the Apoſtle advertiſeth the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that JESUS CHRIST was born, before men believed what He Preached; Is not this a great ſecret, and highly conducing to the Apoſtles deſign? Then again, who gave them the Authority, they aſſume, to change the ſenſe of the words of GOD? St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the LORD is the firſt-born of every creature.</hi> By what right, do they reſtrain, a ſubject of ſo great, and vaſt extent, to the faithful alone? The faithful (ſay they) are created anew, of the LORD! Who doubts it? St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.10. 2 Cor. 5.17.</note> 
                        <hi>that they are the workmanſhip of GOD, created in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST unto good works:</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>that if any one he in CHRIST, he is a new creature.</hi> But it followeth not thence, that the word, <hi>Creature,</hi> put purely, and ſingly, as here, muſt be taken, for the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of JESUS CHRIST, and His Apoſtles, only The Scripture never uſeth ſo to ſpeak. As for the eighth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where they pretend, that the Apoſtle ſignifieth the faithful alone, by <hi>all the Creatures,</hi> which ſigh,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.21.</note> and are in travel together; this is a new dream, no leſs abſurd, than the former; it being clear, by all the circumſtances of the paſſage, that thoſe creatures there are not the children of GOD, but of another ſort. St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly diſtinguiſheth them, ſaying of thoſe, <hi>that they alſo ſhall be delivered,</hi>

The LORD meaneth all the things, which GOD hath created, either in the firſt, or in the ſecond world. He being the principle of the one, and the other, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he had ſaid in the ſame Book generally, and indefinitely. <hi>I am Alpha,</hi>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50919:36"/>creature of GOD,</hi> that is, a divine, and celeſtial creature: a quality, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently reſtraineth the ſenſe of the word <hi>Creature,</hi> to which it is annexed, unto the moſt excellent kind of creatures, that is the faithful. Whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here ſimply, every creature, without adding, of GOD, or divine, or any other word, that might contract, and limit the ſignification of the general term, <hi>Creature,</hi> to one of its ſpecies only, that is the faithful. Rejecting therefore theſe mens gloſs, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, and contrary, both to the Apoſtles ſcope, and ſtile, we ſay, that by <hi>every creature,</hi> he meaneth, what the Scripture, and all the languages of men, do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſignifie, by theſe words, namely, created things, the Heavens, and the Earth, and all that in them is.</p>
                     <p>But here riſe up the <hi>Arians,</hi> another ſort of Hereticks, who infiſting upon this interpretation, conclude hence, that the Son of GOD is a creature, ſince He is called, the firſt-born of them; alledging, that the firſt-born is of the ſame nature, with His brethren; and adding, to fortine their pretention, that in effect, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream wiſdom,
<note place="margin">Prov. 8.22.</note> which is no other, than the Son, ſaith in the <hi>Proverbs, that GOD created it, in the beginning of His wayes, before He made any of His works;</hi> which is nothing elſe, as they affirm, but what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here; <hi>that the Son is the firſt-born of every creature;</hi> and they adjoyn alſo, that which is ſaid in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews,
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.2.</note> 
                        <hi>that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is faithful to Him, who made Him,</hi> that is, as they pretend, to GOD, who created Him. But GOD forbid, we ſhould rank Him with creatures, to whom the Scripture aſcribeth the glory of having created them all, and unto whom, it commandeth us, to give that ſupream adoration, which is due to GOD alone, and not to any creature. The Apoſtle, in this very place, which they abuſe, putteth a moſt evident diſtinction, between the Son, and other things, For whereas he calleth them creatures, he ſaith of the Son, that He is, not the firſt-created (as ſhould have been ſaid, if He were of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) but the firſt-born; an evident ſign, that He received His being, of the Father, by a divine, and ineffable generation; and not by creation. As for that which they cite out of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> not to urge another expoſition of it, the original text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, <hi>that GOD poſſeſſed wiſdom in the beginning of his ways</hi> (as our Bibles have well rendred it) and not that <hi>He created it,</hi> as the Greek interpreters have unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken it. And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, that GOD did make CHRIST,</hi> he meaneth, not that He Created Him, (a conceit, which would be quite beſide his purpoſe) but that He ordained, and ſet Him up High Prieſt in His Church.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.6.</note> Even as when <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith, <hi>that GOD made</hi> Moſes, <hi>and</hi> Aaron; He ſignifieth, that He eſtabliſhed them in the charges, they bore among His people. And it's in this ſenſe, we muſt underſtand St. <hi>Peters</hi> language in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 2.36.</note> 
                        <hi>that GOD hath made JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, both LORD, and CHRIST:</hi> that is, hath ordained Him unto theſe great dignities. And ſo from theſe paſſages it duly follows, that the Son of GOD, was called the Annointed, and ſetled in His office of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>diator (which we do confeſs) but not that His Divine nature was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, (which is that, we utterly deny.) In fine, for the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place, ſome anſwer, that by ſaying, <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the firſt born of every creature,</hi> he only ſignifieth, that He was born before all creatures, and perhaps, it would be very difficult, that I ſay not impoſſible, to refute this expoſition. Yet there is another, which I judge more fluent, and indeed more ſuitable, both to the ſcope, and to the ſequel of this Text: It is, to underſtand by the <hi>firſt born,</hi> the owner, the Lord, and the Prince of every creature. That which the Apoſtle addeth <hi>For by Him were created all things in Heaven, and in earth,</hi> perfectly accordeth with this ſenſe; it being clear, that the creation of things is a true and ſolid title, to that power and Lordſhip, which GOD hath over them. Why is the Son of GOD, the Lord of every creature? Becauſe there is not any of them, but He did create the ſame; and it is good reaſon, He ſhould diſpoſe of them, and govern them at His pleaſure, ſince He gave them all the being, or life, that they have. And that the word, <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> may be taken, to ſignifie, Maſter, and Lord, is evident, both by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in Scripture, and by the reaſon of the thing it ſelf. For the LORD pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> to make <hi>David, the firſt-born of the Kings of the earth;</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.27.</note> as every one ſeeth, to make Him Maſter, and the chief of Kings; it being evident,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50919:36"/>that, to ſpeak properly, he was not their elder brother; being neither brother unto other Kings, nor more aged than they. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith alſo; in His Prophecy,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 14.30.</note> 
                        <hi>the firſt-born of the poor,</hi> to ſignifie, the chiefeſt poor, thoſe that, (if I may ſo ſay) do carry away the prize for poverty; though otherwiſe, they were born, neither before others, nor of the ſame family with them. But the paſſage in <hi>Job</hi> is more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than any other; where mention is of the <hi>firſt-born of death.</hi> He is meant,
<note place="margin">Job 18.13.</note> that hath the power, and the adminiſtration of death, the Angel, and Prince of death, and (as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>he that hath the dominion of death.</hi> The reaſon of this manner of ſpeaking is alſo throughly evident. For the eldeſt-born, by the law, and cuſtome of moſt Nations, heretofore were, and to this day are, the principal of the family, the heads, and in a manner the LORD's as well of their brethren, as of the ſlaves, and goods: whence hath come this kind of language, even the putting <hi>eldeſt</hi> or <hi>firſt-born,</hi> to ſignifie the head, the Lord, and the Maſter. We ſay therefore, that it is in this ſence, we muſt underſtand the Apoſtles ſaying, <hi>that CHRIST is the firſt-born of every creature,</hi> to wit, the Maſter, and Lord of them. Which no way inferreth, that himſelf is a creature; Lords not being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of the ſame extraction, and lineage with their ſubjects, but moſt frequently of another very different. And as it would be ridiculous reaſoning, to conclude, that he that hath the dominion of death, is death it ſelf, under the colour that <hi>Job</hi> termeth him, <hi>the firſt-born of death:</hi> ſo is it moſt impertinent arguing, to infer, that the LORD is a creature, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>that he is the firſt-born of every creature.</hi> We have a paſſage, exactly parallel with this, in the beginning of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.2</note> 
                        <hi>that GOD hath eſtabliſhed His Son heir of all things, by whom alſo He made the worlds.</hi> There you ſee, firſt, that he expreſſeth the Lordſhip, which JESUS CHRIST hath over all the creatures, by a figurative word, ſtiling Him the Heir of them. For that the word, Heir, was taken by the ancients, to mean Lord, and Maſter,

                           <hi>Inſtit. l.</hi> 2. <hi>tit.</hi> 19. <hi>S. ult.</hi>
                        </note> the Civilians themſelves have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And ſecondly, you ſee further, that the Apoſtle, after the ſame manner, as in the Text, doth found the dominion which JESUS CHRIST hath in the whole univerſe, upon His being the Creator of it. For it is this he meaneth, when he ſaith, <hi>that by Him, GOD made the worlds.</hi> Be it then concluded, that this Primogeniture of the LORD JESUS over every creature, is nothing elſe; but that glorious, and ſoveraign Empire, which He hath over the whole world, and every of its parts, by the right of creation; being the ſupream, and abſolute LORD thereof, as He that brought all creatures out of nothing, and gave them every degree of that being, which they have.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee, Dear Brethren, that which we had to ſay to you, for the expoſition of this Text. Let us make our profit of it, and extract the uſes it containeth, and the ſuccour it may give us againſt ſin, and errour. Firſt, it furniſheth us with what to anſwer thoſe, that blame us, for having no images among us. Tell them, that JESUS CHRIST, the only moſt perfect image of GOD ſufficeth us. This is an image, we ſecurely honour, without fear of offending GOD; becauſe it is a true one, and ſhews us to the life, and in reality, all the perfections of the Father: whereas the others that are offered us, are the work of mens hands, inventions of their ſuperſtition, and images, not of GOD; but of their own vain imaginations. Their very being viſible, doth diſcover their falſity; ſince that GOD is inviſible. For to repreſent an inviſible nature by colours, is to do much worſe, than if you ſhould paint whiteneſs, with a cole; or light with darkneſs. Your images, O ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, are dead, and inſenſible; deſtitute of the advantages, which nature hath given to the leaſt, and loweſt animals. Ours is alive, and intelligent: the ſource of life, and wiſdom. Yours are incapable of ſeeing, or rewarding the ſervice you do them. Ours knoweth our hearts, and hath an infinite goodneſs, and power. For JESUS, the image of GOD, that we adore, <hi>is the firſt-born of every creature,</hi> the Soveraign Maſter of the univerſe. Let us boldly addreſs our moſt religious ſervices to Him. And ſince it is in Him, that GOD manifeſteth Himſelf to us, have we Him ſtill before our eyes, ſeeking the true knowledge of GOD, in Him alone. There, we ſhall ſee Him, as He is. But let this ſeeing, by no means be idle; He doth not ſet before us this moſt full-wrought table of His perfections, which he hath
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50919:37"/>drawn to the life in His CHRIST, that we ſhould unprofitably feed our eyes therewith; but that we ſhould imitate Him, each one according to our ſmall abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſhould expreſs in our ſouls ſome draughts of that perfect goodneſs, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſhineth ſo gloriouſly in Him; and become, every of us, by little, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, a pure, and lively image of our LORD. Conſider, how He was obedient to the Father, charitable to men, helpful to the afflicted, compaſſionate to ſinners, ſweet, and kind to enemies. There is, Chriſtian, the pattern of your life. Follow theſe ſacred examples. Serve GOD, like Him, patiently bearing all that He layeth on you, marching couragiouſly, where He calleth you. Love men, as He lov'd them, cheerfully employing all that you are, or can do, for their edification; communicating your goods to the poor, your light to the ignorant, your aſſiſtance to the oppreſſed. Let not their badneſs withhold you, from being good. If they offend you, pardon them, and pray for them; and conceive, as the LORD ſaid, that they know not what they do; neither their injuries, nor their ſoothings of you, turning you ever from piety. Fear not the hatred, nor the force of the world. Remember, that as this JESUS whom you ſerve, is the image of GOD; ſo He is likewiſe, the firſt-born of every creature. He hath them all in His hand. He commandeth the Heavens, and the Elements; He governeth men, and beaſts. All the parts of nature owe Him, and render Him a prompt obedience; and will they, nill they, do nothing againſt His orders. Having the Maſter of all things for Head, and Saviour, how is it, you are not aſhamed of your timidity? The wind maketh us to ſhake, as the leaves of the wood. The leaſt ſound affrighteth us; and inſtead of glorifying the LORD here, in His palace, in peace, and joy, <hi>while His voice maketh the world trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> we tremble, while the world is in repoſe. Is it this, that we promiſed JESUS CHRIST? Is this to bear His Croſs with patience, and reſiſt, for His ſalte, even unto blood? Is this that lively, and unmoveable faith, whereof we make profeſſion, which ſhould carry us through waters, and through flames, without appalling? If the Providence of the LORD were unknown to us, our weakneſs would be leſs inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable: but now that we have lived, for ſo long a time, by continual meer miracles of His goodneſs; why doubt we ſo eaſily of a carefulneſs, and fidelity, we have ſo many a time experimented, and had proof of? You ſee, on the preſent occaſion, what thoughts, for us, He hath inſpired, into the ſacred powers, that govern us; and even the ſupream among them: what order they have taken for our ſafety, and what care they declare themſelves reſolved to take of it, for the future, receiving us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of their edicts. Dear Brethren, it is an admirable effect of the love, which the LORD beareth us. Let us enjoy it with perfect thankfulneſs, both towards Him, and towards His Miniſters, the Princes, of whom He is the firſt-born in a particular manner. Let us not diſturb the work of His grace, by our fears, and diffidences; but aſſured of His infinite goodneſs, and power, let us rely upon the truth of His promiſes, and reſt upon His favourable Providence, quietly, and comfortably finiſhing this ſhort journey which we have begun; waiting, till this holy, and merciful LORD, after having conducted, and comforted us in this deſert, do raiſe us up on high to the mountain of His holineſs: where far from evils, and from dangers, and from fears, we ſhall glorifie Him eternally with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Holy Spirit, the true, and only GOD, bleſſed for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>AMong all the reaſons, for which we have a right to the things, that we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, there is none more juſt, or more natural, than that, which ariſeth from the production of them; it being evident, that what iſſueth from us, ſhould depend upon us; and that it is juſt, every one ſhould diſpoſe of what he hath made. Thus you ſee, that among all the Nations of the earth, children do belong to the Parents, who begat them; and works, either of the mind, or body, are theirs, that formed them, and ſet them forth. This right is the firſt, and the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent foundation of all the poſſeſſions, and dominions of mankind; the power, which men have, to give, to ſell, or exchange things, proceeding from hence, that either themſelves, or thoſe of whom they received them, did give, or preſerve, that being which they have. For if you go back to the firſt ſources of humane laws and inſtitutions, you will find, that men aſſumed not Dominion or poſſeſſion, ſave of the perſons, whom they had either naturally begotten, or ſaved in war, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, and giving the life they might have taken from them; and of things, which they had, either made, and compoſed, as buildings; or at leaſt improved, and cultivated, as the grounds they cleanſed, and tilled. It's from thence that were formed by little, and little, thoſe good, and juſt eſtabliſhments, of Families, of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of States, and of Laws neceſſary for their government, which have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mankind to this preſent time. You ſee likewiſe, that GOD our Soveraign Lord, to juſtifie, both the right He hath to diſpoſe of us, as ſeemeth Him good; and the obligation we have to ſerve Him, ordinarily urgeth this reaſon, that <hi>He hath created us. It is He, that hath made us</hi> (ſaith his Prophet) <hi>and not we our ſelves.</hi>

                        <hi>We are His people, and the flock of His paſture.</hi> It's by the ſame conſideration, that He ſilenceth the refractory, and prophane, who have the inſolence to blame His diſpoſals. <hi>Shall the thing formed ſay to Him, that formed it,</hi>

                        <hi>why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power to make divers veſſels of the ſame maſs?</hi> It's further by the ſame reaſon, My Brethren, the Apoſtle proveth in this place, that JESUS CHRIST, the Son of GOD, is the Lord of all things. Having ſaid afore, that <hi>He is the firſt-born,</hi> (that is the Maſter) <hi>of every creature,</hi> he now alledgeth us the proof of it, taken from his being the Creatour of all things. <hi>For by Him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all things were created, that are in Heaven, and that are in earth, viſible, and inviſible, whether Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalites, or Powers. All things were Created by Him, and for Him. And He is before all things, and by Him all things ſubſiſt.</hi> This reaſon is clear, and invincible. For, if man, who giveth, to the things He maketh, only the form of their being, working in all his operations upon borrowed matter; do yet acquire thereby a right of dominion over them, as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50919:38"/>we ſaid even now; ſo that He may diſpoſe of them as He will: How much more juſtly is the Son of GOD, the Maſter, and Lord of all the Creatures, ſince He cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them, that is, gave them the whole being, which they have, not the form only, but the matter alſo, whereof they conſiſt? having brought them out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; having entirely made, and formed them by the ſole might of His power, without any ſubject, for His diſplaying it upon, exiſtent, when He firſt created them? And this proof clearly inferreth, that which we laid down, in the precedent action, to wit, that when the Apoſtle there calleth JESUS CHRIST, the <hi>firſt-born of every creature,</hi> He ſimply meaneth, that He is the Maſter of them, and not (as the hereticks pretend) that He is a Creature, as they are, and only created before them. For the reaſon which St. <hi>Paul</hi> annexeth, taken from His having created them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth rightly, that He is Maſter of them; but not, that He was created Himſelf. Otherwiſe it muſt by the ſame means be ſaid, that the Father, who created all things, was alſo created Himſelf; a blaſphemy, which the moſt ſhameleſs hereticks would abhorr. For if the Apoſtles diſcourſe be good, and pertinent (as all Chriſtians confeſs) thus muſt His reaſoning be; Whoever hath created all things, the ſame is the firſt-born of every creature; But the LORD JESUS hath created all things. He is therefore <hi>the firſt-born of every creature.</hi> There you ſee clearly, that this firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>Whoever hath created all things, is the firſt-born of every creature,</hi> cannot be true, ſave in this ſenſe, that He is the maſter of every creature; but it is evidently falſe in the ſenſe, that the hereticks take the words <hi>firſt-born of every creature,</hi> that is, created before every other creature: it being clear, that the Father, who created all things, is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and ſure was not created. It muſt therefore of neceſſity be ſaid, that the Apoſtle, by <hi>the firſt-born of every creature,</hi> doth mean, their LORD, and Maſter. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe His diſcourſe would not be pertinent. But having ſufficiently juſtified, in our laſt action, and cleared this concluſion of St. <hi>Pauls, that the Son of GOD is the firſt-born of every creature,</hi> let us conſider now the reaſon of it he alledgeth, drawn from hence, <hi>viz. that He created all things, and that they are all for Him, and all ſubſiſt by Him:</hi> that is to ſay, He is the Author, the End, and the Conſerver of them. It is a truth of infinite importance in Chriſtian Religion, both of it ſelf, and for its own merit; as alſo for the great contradictions, it hath ſuffered, at all times, from the enemies of the Divinity of JESUS CHRIST both ancient, and modern, who have put to it all their force, that they might either overthrow, or at leaſt ſhake it. For this cauſe, we are obliged to examine the preſent Text, wherein it is ſo ſtatelily founded, with ſo much the more care; and that we may omit nothing, which is neceſſary for the clearing of it, we will conſider, in the firſt place, what the Apoſtle ſaith of the Son of GOD: that <hi>All things were created by Him, and for Him; and that He is before all things, and that they all ſubſiſt by Him.</hi> Next we will view, in the ſecond place, the diviſion he maketh of all theſe things, which the LORD created: ſome, <hi>they that are in Heaven,</hi> others, <hi>they that are in earth;</hi> ſome, <hi>viſible,</hi> others, <hi>inviſible,</hi> as <hi>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, and Powers.</hi> Theſe ſhall be, if the LORD will, the two parts, and as it were, the two Articles of this Action. May it pleaſe GOD, to guide us, by His Spirit, in ſo ſublime a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to enable us, by His grace, to refer it, to His glory, and to our own edification, and conſolation.</p>
                     <p>In the former of theſe two Articles, the Apoſtle (as you ſee) ſaith, firſt, that <hi>All things were created by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>that they were all created for Him;</hi> in the third place, that <hi>He is before all things;</hi> and laſtly, <hi>that they all ſubſiſt by Him.</hi> For though theſe four points be near a kin, and neceſſarily linked the one with the others, yet they are diſtinct at the bottome, and ought to come under conſideration ſeverally; there being neither of them, but doth contribute ſomthing particular, to the glory of our great GOD, and Saviour JESUS CHRIST. The firſt is plain, that <hi>All things were created by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> For where is the Chriſtian, who underſtands not this, and knows not, that <hi>to create,</hi> doth ſignifie, in the uſe of Scripture, <hi>to make a thing,</hi> either <hi>of nothing,</hi> or <hi>of a matter, which had no diſpoſedneſs to the form, that it receiveth.</hi> And foraſmuch as there is none, but the Divine Power, that is capable of ſuch an action, or operation; thence it comes, that this word is never attributed to any, but GOD only. There's none
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50919:38"/>but He that doth create things. For this cauſe, among the other Titles which are given him for marks of His glory, He is ſtiled, <hi>The Creator;</hi> this Title appertaining unto Him alone. When the Apoſtle then ſaith here, and twice repeats it, <hi>That all things were created by the Son,</hi> he ſignifieth, that it is of Him they received all the being they have; that it is He, who by this Noble and Divine manner of working, which the Scripture calls Creation, brought them from non-being, to a being; who by His infinite power, produced the matter of which they conſiſt; prepar'd it, and fitted it as it now is, inveſting it with thoſe forms, and admirable qualities, on which all the motions of their nature do depend; that is to ſay in one word, The LORD JESUS is the Creator of the Univerſe. It was not poſſible to expreſs this truth more clearly. And thus it is, that all Chriſtians always underſtood this paſſage, until thoſe new Enemies of the Divinity of our LORD, who blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly ſay, that He hath no actual ſubſiſtence in the world, but ſince His birth of the holy Virgin; they not able to bear ſo reſpendent a light, have endeavoured to obſcure it by the fumes of their frivolous and falſe gloſſes. They ſay therefore, that the word <hi>Create</hi> ſignifieth in this place, mearly to reform and re-eſtabliſh things; to put them in a better eſtate than they were in; and not to bring them out of nothing, and give them their whole being. They will have it, that the Apoſtle by ſaying, <hi>All things were created by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> doth intend, not the firſt Creation of the World, when ariſing out of nothing, it receiv'd its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural being and form from the Creator: But the Renovation of the World, wrought by the Preaching of the Goſpel, and by the word of the Apoſtles, whom the LORD ſent to reform the Nations, and to put things in an incomparably better and more happy eſtate, than they were in before. Enſlav'd they were to the Empire of Sin and Satan; whereas by the Doctrine and Power of the LORD JESUS they have now been conſecrated to God, and ſanctified to His glory. Unto this I anſwer, That it's true, the World was renewed by the Goſpel; inaſmuch as this holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine did aboliſh both the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Diſcipline, and the falſe Religions of the Heathen, and formed in the whole earth a new people that ſerve God in Spirit and in Truth, being created in righteouſneſs and holineſs. I acknowledge alſo, that this Renovation is the work of a Divine Power, and could not have been effected by any Humane or Angelical ſtrength; by reaſon whereof it may and ought to be called a Creation; it being evident, that there was need of no leſs vertue to reform the World. than to create it. And finally, I grant likewiſe, that JESUS the Son of GOD, is the true and ſingle Author of this ſecond Creation. But to this I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn two things; firſt, That though this paſſage might be underſtood of this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the World; yet it would of neceſſity infer, That JESUS, to whom it is attributed, is the true Eternal GOD. For ſince this work is no leſs, nay ſince it is greater than that of Creation; it is evident, that none but a true GOD could be the Author of it: It being clear (as we ſhall ſay anon) that Creation is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in Scripture, as an Argument of true and eternal Divinity. And the thing ſpeaks of it ſelf. For ſince a Divine and Infinite Vertue is requiſite, to regenerate men and deſtroy the ſervitude of Sin and Satan; it muſt of neceſſity be acknowledged, That JESUS the Author of this great work, hath an infinite power; that is to ſay, is truly GOD; no finite ſubject being capable of an Infinite power, and none being infinite but GOD alone. Thus you ſee, it is in vain that the Hereticks do toil them; their own Interpretation (though it were admitted) neceſſarily inferring the thing which they oppoſe; to wit, That JESUS is true GOD, Infinite and Eternal, and ſubſiſting before all ages. But I ſay, in the ſecond place, that this Text cannot be underſtood of the Reparation, or ſecond Creation of the World. Firſt, becauſe the Apoſtle will by and by ſpeak of that in the three Verſes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following; where He loftily deſcribeth it, ſaying, <hi>That JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the head of the body, the Church, the beginning, and the firſt-born from the dead: By whom the Father hath reconciled all things to Himſelf, as well Celeſtial as Terreſtrial, having made peace by the blood of His croſs.</hi> By means hereof, unleſs we will render S. <hi>Paul</hi> guilty of vain babling, and uſeleſs repetition; we muſt confeſs, that as in this ſecond place, he ſpeaks of the Reparation and Renovation of things; ſo in the former, he ſpake of their firſt Creation. Secondly, this ſame appears again, from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50919:39"/>his reckoning the Angels expreſly among the things created by JESUS CHRIST, yea, he inſiſteth on them more than on the reſt (as we ſhall ſee hereafter). ſaying, <hi>That by Him were created things in heaven, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities and Powers.</hi> But the Angels were not renewed, nor repaired by JESUS CHRIST, ſince that ſin neither ruined their nature, nor made it wax old, nor ſubjected it to vanity. It muſt therefore be concluded, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks here, not of the reparation of things, but of the firſt creation of them; it being moſt certain, that the Angels were created, their nature, though holy, yet being not, for all that, eternal, and without beginning, I grant, that by the Salvation which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from JESUS CHRIST, the Angels have been re-united to us, and ſettled again in peace and good intelligence with us, from whom our ſin had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and eſtranged them; and this is that the Apoſtle meaneth, when he ſaith here beneath,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.20. Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi>That GOD hath reconciled things in heaven, and things in earth by the death of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> and elſwhere, <hi>that He hath recapitulated, or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together again in CHRIST, both that which is in heaven, and that which is on earth.</hi> But this is not to be called a creating of the Angels; nor can any example of ſuch extravagant language be produced, that creating of perſons was put, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a reconciling them with thoſe they hated, and whoſe communion they avoided, Otherwiſe, ſince JESUS CHRIST reconciled us alſo with GOD the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, incorporating us into His family, ſo as He is thereby become our Father, and we His children, in the ſame manner that we are brethren with the Angels; it might, to expreſs this, be alſo ſaid, That JESUS CHRIST created GOD the Father; which no ear, I ſay not Chriſtian, but that is ever ſo little rational, could poſſibly endure. Finally, the contexture it ſelf of the Apoſtles words doth evidently ſhew, that they muſt be underſtood neceſſarily, of the firſt, and not of the ſecond creation of things. I confeſs, the Holy GHOST ſometimes uſeth the word <hi>Create, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </hi> ſignifie the Production of the ſecond work of GOD; that is, the work of His grace in JESUS CHRIST. But He never doth it without ſome addition and reſtriction, that evidently limitteth the word to ſuch a ſenſe, as for example,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 65.17.18.</note> when He ſaith in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that he is about to <hi>create new heavens, and a new earth;</hi> and that he is about to <hi>create Jeruſalem to be a joy, and her people gladneſs:</hi> The very form of this language, ordered in the Future Tenſe, as you ſee, and thoſe <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which He ſaith he is about to create, do evidently ſhew, that it is not of the firſt creation of the world He intended to ſpeak. So when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that GOD hath created them both</hi> (that is, the Jews and the Gentiles) <hi>in Himſelf into one new man:</hi> This latter word <hi>New,</hi> leaveth no place for doubt, but that he meaneth here, the ſecond Operation of God, by which Jews and Gentiles were united into one onely people; and not of the firſt, whereby they were brought forth into their natural exiſtence: And likewiſe, when he ſaith in the ſame place,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.15, 26.</note> that <hi>we are created in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST unto good works, which GOD hath prepared, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> The perſons of whom he ſpeaketh <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> that is, the faithful, diſtinquiſh'd from other men; and the end of this work of GOD, to wit, <hi>good works;</hi> theſe do ſufficiently clear it, that the <hi>Creation</hi> there meant, is the ſecond, and not the firſt: Nor can any reaſonable man doubt of it. In theſe places, and others like them, if there be any, the word <hi>Create</hi> is ſtill limitted and circumſtantiated. Otherwhere, when it is uſed ſimply and abſolutely, it is not to be taken, but for the firſt Creation; as when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.5. Rev. 4.11.</note> that <hi>GOD hath created the Heavens;</hi> and <hi>S. John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that <hi>the LORD created all things,</hi> and in a multitude of the like places: Neither can there be brought ſo much as one to the contrary. For as to that, which the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries alledge, out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where they pretend, that the Apoſtle's ſaying,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.9.</note> 
                        <hi>GOD created all things by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the ſecond, and not the firſt Creation; in this they do not prove, but preſuppoſe the thing in queſtion; nothing obliging us to depart, in this place, more than in the others, from the common ſignification of the Word. Foraſmuch then as in this Text upon which we are, this term <hi>Create,</hi> is uſed ſimply and indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any limitation or reſtriction, the Apoſtle ſaying, and twice repeating, that <hi>all things were created by the Son of GOD;</hi> nay, adding, to ſhew the extent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50919:39"/>of this ſubject more fully, <hi>both things which are in heaven, and things which are in earth, viſible and inviſible, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities and Powers;</hi> let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it muſt be taken as in other places, where it is couched after the ſame manner ſimply and abſolutely; that is to ſay, taken for the firſt, and not the ſecond Creation. If there be liberty to do otherwiſe, and to give it, any where, the ſenſe we pleaſe, without other reaſon, then that of our own fond imagination, who ſeeth not, but that by ſuch an overture, there will be no longer, any thing certain or aſſured left in Scripture? For as theſe Hereticks, by this cavilling gloſs, would deprive the LORD JESUS of the glory of the firſt Creation; another might bereave the Father of it, by the ſame means; interpreting the paſſages of Scripture, which affirm, that GOD created the world, not of its firſt Production, by which it came out of nothing into being; but mearly of a Reparation, or a Renovation of the Univerſe; and in conſequence hereof pretend, with ſome Philoſophers, that it was ſurely long before it was created; but not in the condition, and the form, it afterward obtained. But GOD forbid, that Chriſtians ſhould ever ſuffer impiety to have ſuch a licence over the Word of GOD. Let us keep religiouſly to the truths which the Scriptures teach us, and receive their language with a candid and and ſincere belief. Let Hereſie riſe in commotion, and be as unquiet as it will, ſince the Apoſtle, the mouth of Heaven, and the trumpet of GOD proclaimeth, <hi>That all things were created by the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> receive we this ſacred Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; believe it and confeſs it, ſo much the rather, for that it is not here alone, but in divers other places beſide, that the Scripture teacheth it us. For, not to repeat here, that which we touch'd afore, out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>That the Father created all things by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> what can be ſaid more expreſly or directly, then that we read in the beginning of S. <hi>John,</hi> where this Divine Author ſpeaking of the Word, which was made fleſh, and whoſe glory himſelf and his Fellow-brethren ſaw, and who was in the beginning with GOD, ſaith aloud, <hi>That all things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made, that was made:</hi> and that <hi>the world was made by Him?</hi> What can be uttered, or conceived more clear, than what we read in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> where the Apoſtle, not content to have ſaid at the entrance, <hi>That the Father made the Worlds by his Son;</hi> doth ſay of the Son a little after, what the Prophet ſingeth, <hi>LORD, thou haſt founded the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of thine hands.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 1.10.</note> Certainly this proof is ſo firm, that all the Devils of Hell ſhall never be able to pluck it from us. And nothing can be imagined more bruitiſh, than that evaſion which deſpair hath here inſpir'd the Hereticks withal; <hi>Though,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the Apoſtle have alledged theſe words of the</hi> Pſalm, <hi>yet his intention was not to apply them to CHRIST, but the following words only,</hi> Thou remaineſt, and art the ſame, and thy years ſhall not fail: For is not this a plain giving the Apoſtle the lye, who directly affirmeth, that it is to the Son: the holy Spirit ſaith, <hi>LORD, in the beginning thou haſt laid the foundations of the earth?</hi> Beſides, if this alledging of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> do infer nothing elſe, but that the Son is permanent, and ſhall not fail, it will be impertinent, and not at all ſuffice for the Apoſtle's deſign in this place. For his aim is to exalt the Son above the Angels; but if the paſſage he brings for this purpoſe, do conclude only, that the Son is immortal, and immutable; who ſees not, that by this reckoning, he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes nothing to Him, but what agreeth to the Angels alſo, whoſe nature is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe incorruptible and immutable. Since then the Scope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew, that JESUS CHRIST hath qualities, which appertain not to the Angels; and ſince on the other ſide, the paſſage he alledgeth doth repreſent nothing of that kind, but the creating of the world, it muſt of neceſſity be acknowledged, that it is the holy Apoſtle's intention to apply to the LORD principally, this firſt part of the place, wherein is ſaid, <hi>That He hath founded the earth,</hi> and that <hi>the heavens are the work of His hands.</hi> And ſo you ſee, that the Supreme Wiſdom, begotten of the Father before all Ages, which neither is, nor can be any other than the LORD JESUS, doth proteſt in the Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> that it was with GOD, its Eternal Father,
<note place="margin">Prov. 3.</note> when He created the World; to ſhew us, that it was the Governeſs and Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of that great work. And <hi>Moſes</hi> repreſents it to us in the beginning of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi> as far as the nature of the time, and of the Old Teſtament would ſuffer. For
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50919:40"/>he reporteth GOD, not creating any thing, but by his Word, He ſheweth Him ſpeaking at every part of His Work. <hi>GOD ſaid, Let there be light. GOD ſaid, Let there be a Firmament. GOD ſaid, Let the waters be divided, and let the day land ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> and ſo in all the reſt. Whence comes it, that ſo ſage a Writer, makes this Supreme and unſpeakable Nature ſpeak thus, for the creating of each of His Works. Let the Jew toil himſelf to the utmoſt, he will never be able to give us a good and pertinent reaſon of it,
<note place="margin">John 1.1.</note> ſuch as may content our minds. But S. <hi>John</hi> calling the Son of GOD the Word, unvails this ſecret to us; ſhewing us, that it is by this His Word the Father did create the world. And <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſignifie it myſtically, and in ſuch ſort as became that time, repreſents GOD not creating ought, but by ſpeaking. Be it then concluded, againſt the obſtinate fury of Hereticks, that the LORD JESUS is the Creator of all things.</p>
                     <p>And this is ſo clear, that the moſt part of thoſe very men that deny His Eternal Divinity, have not refuſed to acknowledge it: as they in particular, who after the name of their old Leader, are commonly called <hi>Arrians:</hi> theſe avouching, that it is by Him the Father created the Univerſe at the beginning; yet forbear not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that He is Eternal GOD, of the ſame Eſſence with the Father. Wherein, as I confeſs, they ſhew more modeſty than the reſt; not having the forehead to reject, what the Scripture doth ſo clearly exhibite: So I muſt needs ſay, they diſcover leſs perceivance and acuteneſs; admitting a truth, incompatible with the error which they hold. For if the LORD JESUS did create the world, as they ſay, in concurrence with the Scripture, do confeſs, it muſt of neceſſity be granted, that He is very JEHOVAH, whom in time paſt Iſrael did adore; which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the thing that they oppoſe. This conſequence appears, firſt, from what we noted afore, That the Scripture never aſcribes the action of <hi>Creating</hi> to any, but GOD only. Secondly, from that in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the title of <hi>Creator</hi> is given to the true GOD, to diſtinguiſh Him from creatures, as being incommunicable to any other beſides Him.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.5. &amp; 45.12. &amp; 48.13. &amp; 51.13.</note> 
                        <hi>It is I</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>who have made the earth, and who have ſtretched out the Heavens.</hi> Finally, the thing ſpeaks of it ſelf. For the Power requiſite for the creating the world (that is, to make it of nothing) is ſo great and ſo infinite, that the Philoſophers, with all the light of their Reaſon, could not comprehend it; but were ſo far from attributing it to any Creature, that they deny'd it unto GOD Himſelf. Whence it follows, that if there be any part of Divine Glory proper and eſſential unto GOD, it is this ſame without all doubt. Seeing then it is found in the LORD JESUS, we muſt neceſſarily confeſs, that He is in truth the Great GOD, moſt High, Eternal, and Bleſſed for ever above all things. As for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction they advance to cover their error, alledging, that the Son was but the Inſtrument and Miniſter of the Father in the work of Creation; not the firſt and principal cauſe, it is vain and frivilous. For this creative vertue being infinite, it cannot be but in an Infinite ſubject, and in a Soveraign and principal Agent. It cannot be communicated to an Inſtrument, ſeeing that every Inſtrument being finite, is conſequently uncapable of receiving, and containing an Infinite ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; ſo as, ſince it is in the perſon of the Son, it unavoidably follows, that He is not the inſtrumental, as they ſay; but the firſt and the principal cauſe in the work of Creation.
<note place="margin">Rev. 1.</note> And S. <hi>John</hi> clearly ſhews it in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>That He is Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt;</hi> a thing that cannot be ſaid of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental cauſe, which hath neceſſarily above it another Agent of a diverſe nature. The Apoſtle alſo clearly refuteth this gloſs, when he appropiates that to JESUS CHRIST, which the Prophet uttered evidently of the firſt, the principal and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme cauſe of the Creation; <hi>LORD, thou haſt founded the earth at the beginning and the Heavens are the works of thy hands:</hi> An Application, which would be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe and impertinent, if JESUS CHRIST were only the inſtrmental cauſe of the Creation. The obſervation upon which they pretend to ground this diſtinction, is no whit more ſolid, to wit, that the Scripture ſaith indeed, the world was created by the Son; but not that the Son did create the world. For firſt, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in expreſs terms, that the Son founded the earth, and though he had not ſaid it, who ſees not, but that the one and the other do amount to the ſame thing? and that His ſaving, <hi>All things were created by the Son,</hi> is all one, as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50919:40"/>if he had ſaid, <hi>That the Son created all things:</hi> But if this form of Speech would infer, that the Son is not the firſt and principal Efficient of the Creation, the ſame muſt be concluded alſo of the Father, ſince S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of Him, ſaith in like manner, <hi>That All things are of Him, and by Him, and for Him.</hi> But that which he ſaith here of JESUS CHRIST, in the ſecond place, <hi>That all things were created for Him,</hi> doth further demonſtrate the ſame truth very clearly. For theſe words do ſignifie, that the Son is the laſt and ſupreme end of the Creation of things; a matter which pertaineth only to the principal cauſe, and not to the inſtrument it uſeth for the effecting of its work. Sure it is clear, that it's the true GOD, who is the ultimate end for which all things were created, that the glory of His Divine Vertues might be manifeſted, ſo as He might be known and ſerved as He is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. This falls not under conteſt. Since therefore it is for the Son, that all things were created, it muſt be acknowledged, that He is the true Eternal GOD; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not poſſible that a Creature ſhould be the end, for which all things were created. From thence the Apoſtle concludes in the third place, <hi>That JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is before all things.</hi> For ſince He created them all, it muſt of neceſſity be, that He ſhould ſubſiſt, before they were. And he noteth it expreſly, that none might ſuſpect Him of novelty, as if he He had not been, but ſince <hi>Moſes,</hi> under colour of His having not been manifeſted, till the fulneſs of time.
<note place="margin">John 8.</note> He is not only before <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> (as Himſelf ſaith in S. <hi>John</hi>) but before all things, from the beginning, before there was any thing created, before the mountains were ſettled,
<note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> and before the hills. As ſaith Wiſdom, that is, the Son himſelf, in the Book of the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> But the Apoſtle, after having thus given to the LORD JESUS, the glory of creating all things, paſſeth on further, and attributeth to Him the preſervation of them. <hi>All things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſubſiſt by him.</hi> It's this, which he expreſſeth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in other terms, when he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.3.</note> 
                        <hi>That he ſuſtaineth all things by His powerful word:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>He preſerves them by His Providence, as He created them by His vertue;</hi> their being, their life, and their motion, ſo depending on Him, that when He hideth His face they are troubled, and fail utterly, and return unto their duſt, or their nothing, as the Prophet ſingeth. Whence yet again appears,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.29.</note> that He is the true GOD, the Eternal one, bleſſed for ever, with the Father; foraſmuch as this preſervation of the Univerſe, is one of the higheſt and moſt incommunicable glories of the Deity.</p>
                     <p>Let us now conſider, what are thoſe things, whoſe Creation and Conſervation the Apoſtle doth attribute to the Son of GOD: <hi>All things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were created by Him; thoſe that are in heaven, and thoſe that are in earth; viſible and inviſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers.</hi> He leaves not any Creature, of higher, or of middle, or of lower rank, without the reach of his aſſertion; and for the encloſing of them all within it, he makes uſe firſt of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion taken from their elements, I mean, the places where their natural abode is, ſaying, <hi>Things in heaven, and things in earth.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaketh often of them, in the ſame manner. As when we are forbidden in the Decalogue, to make Religious uſe of any Image, or the likeneſs of any thing whatever, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make thee</hi> (ſaith the LORD) <hi>any image, of things that are in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth.</hi> By <hi>Heaven</hi> he meaneth, not only that vaſt Region, where we ſee the Sun and the other Stars to be lifted up: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Paradiſe, the Habitation of Angels, and of the ſouls of Saints above: and this void ſpace, where the Fowls do fly, and where the Showers, and the Thunders, and the other Meteors, are formed below. By <hi>Earth,</hi> he meaneth this whole Globe wherein we live, with the waters that run in ſtream, or do float here. There being then no creature, but is in one of theſe two places; it is evident, he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them all, by ſaying, <hi>The things that are in heaven, and thoſe that are in earth.</hi> But he addeth yet another diviſion no leſs general, taken from the quality of the things themſelves; which all are, either viſible, as the Heavens, the Elements, the Plants; and the living Creatures; or inviſible, as the Devils, and the Angels, and the ſouls of men. And to the end none might imagine that the good Angels, by reaſon of the excellency of their admirable nature, were excepted from this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Apoſtle makes expreſſeſt mention of them, giving a touch at the falſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50919:41"/>Teachers thereby, who taught the worſhipping of Angels, as he will ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. To refute this error, he ranketh them by name, among the things that were created by JESUS CHRIST, and that depend on Him, and were made for Him. For there is no doubt, but they are the holy Angels, whom he calleth here <hi>Thrones,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom 8.37. Epheſ. 1.21.</note> 
                        <hi>Dominions, Principalities and Powers:</hi> And he uſeth theſe words ſo often in this ſenſe, as in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and elſewhere, that I wonder not a little at ſome Expoſitors, who give them here another refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. There is great likelihood that this diverſity of names doth ſignifie a great difference among the Angels. Indeed, there is no ſort of Creatures in the whole Univerſe, but an admirable variety is found among them; that Soveraign Wiſdom which hath formed them, having pleaſed to ſet forth the infinite riches of His power and underſtanding, in the diverſity of thoſe ranks, qualities and functions by which He hath diſtinguiſh'd things, which are otherwiſe of a like, yea, of the ſame nature. To paſs by the reſt, who can reckon up the differences of eſtates, of conditions, of temperaments and inclinations, which are obſerved among men? All of them have the ſame nature, none have the ſame form, nor the ſame counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. We may not doubt, but that there is ſomthing ſemblable among the Angels, and that in their intelligible World, there is ſome image of that variety, which renders our viſible one ſo beautiful, and ſo mervellous. The Apoſtle to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this difference of their Orders, uſeth the names of thoſe divers degrees which are found in the States and Polities of the world; where are <hi>Thrones;</hi> that is, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs and Kings; <hi>Dominions,</hi> that is, Dignities, which though very high, yet art beneath Kings, as Dukes and Archdukes; then <hi>Principalities,</hi> as the Governors of Cities and Provinces; and laſtly, <hi>Powers,</hi> ſuch as inferior Magiſtrates are, whom the Latines in the Apoſtle's time, did call by the very name that we read here, and it is yet in uſe

Laying aſide therefore, beloved Brethren, the empty and vain Authorities of an humane ſpirit, let us content our ſelves with what the Apoſtle hath told us in this ſubject, and let us diligently make our profit of His Divine inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>Let us learn from them firſt, to adore the LORD JESUS as Creator of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; and to acknowledge by this work of His, His true and eternal Divinity. Let no objection, or carnal difficulty; let no Heretical ſubtilty, ever pluck up this ſacred truth out of our hearts. Let us oppoſe the Apoſtl's Authority, againſt all that men and Devils can ſay or invent to the contrary. And admire we conſtantly, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the wiſdom of the Father, who gave us ſuch a Saviour as our neceſſity did require. For none was able to repair us, but He that firſt made us; and the hand alone which created us, could reſtore us to that bleſſed ſtate, from whence we had fallen by ſin. And ſince GOD hath given us for Mediator, and the Prince of our Salvation, the ſame whom this great frame had for its Creator, let us embrace Him with a firm belief. Be we content with His fulneſs, and regard none beſide Him, in heaven or in earth. The Angels, how ſublime ſoever their nature and their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50919:41"/>dignity be, after all, are but creatures: not to ſpeak of men, who beſide the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their being, were all conceiv'd in ſin. But it is not enough to confeſs, that the LORD JESUS is the Creator of all things, and to acknowledge Him for our only Saviour and Mediator; this Faith muſt work and fructifie in us, it muſt ſpread it ſelf into all the parts of our life, muſt ſanctifie our affections and actions, arm us againſt all the temptations of the enemy, comfort us in affliction, and aſſure us againſt every fear. For ſince JESUS hath created this grand Univerſe; ſince Thrones and Dominions are the work of His hands; ſince it is by His Providence, that this All ſubſiſteth in the ſtate it is; who ſeeth not, with what Devotion we ſhould ſerve ſo Puiſſant a Monarch? This earth, that beareth you; this air, that you breath; theſe heavens, that ſhine on you; theſe plants, and theſe living creatures, that nouriſh or refreſh you; and theſe Celeſtial Powers, which encamp about you; all theſe things are productions of His power, and preſents from His bounty. In like manner, your own nature; this body ſo skilfully compoſed, and that ſoul which enliveneth it, are works of His Providence, which neither were created, nor do now ſubſiſt, but by Him. Is it not reaſonable, that you ſhould conſecrate to His glory, what you do hold only from His Grace? Remember alſo what the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>That as all things were created by Him, ſo they were made for him.</hi> Do not fruſtrate your Creator of His intentions. Live for His glory, ſince it was for it you were created. For if the Heavens and the Elements, and the Winds, and the Meteors, and the Plants, things deaf, and dumb, and inanimate, do preach and celebrate the wonders of their LORD, all of them obeying His voyce, and faithfully ſerving His deſigns; what will our ingratitude be, if with theſe ſenſes, and this excellent reaſon He hath given us, we alone of all His creatures, ſhould croſs His counſels, and diſhonor His Name, inſtead of glorifying it? The glory He requireth of us, is only that we walk in His Commandments; that we abound in good, and holy works; that we depart from all evil, and live in ſuch manner, as may oblige our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to acknowledge, that this JESUS whom we ſerve, is truly a great GOD. Acquit we us then faithfully of theſe duties; and aſſure our ſelves, that if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance His glory, He will provide for our bliſs, and guard us from all that oppoſeth the ſame. For ſince all things, Celeſtial and Terreſtrial; viſible and inviſible, were created, and do ſtill ſubſiſt by Him, there is nothing in the whole world, that ſhould make us afraid: All the Armies of Heaven, of the Elements, and of Nature, are in our Maſters pay, and neither war nor work, but for His intereſts, and by His order. Theſe very <hi>Thrones,</hi> theſe <hi>Principalities,</hi> theſe <hi>Powers,</hi> and theſe <hi>Dominions,</hi> which He hath exalted above all His other creatures, do not employ the mightineſs, and the glory of their nature, but for Him, and for thoſe that fear Him. They are miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to ſerve for their ſakes, that ſhall receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Salvation. They keep us in all our ways. They defend us in life, they aſſiſt us at death, and convey us up into the boſom of our true <hi>Abraham.</hi> Let us live in aſſurance, under the protection of ſo good, and ſo great a LORD, that we may one day receive at His hand bliſsful Immortality, the great and laſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native His Benignity conferreth. <hi>To Him with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, the true GOD, bleſſed over all things, be for ever Honor, Glory, and Praiſe.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>IT is not without juſt cauſe, Beloved Brethren, that the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the union of JESUS CHRIST, and His Church, which was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented at the beginning of the world,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.32.</note> by the marriage of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> doth pronounce it aloud, to be a great ſecret. For in effect, there is nothing in this myſterie, which way ſoever you take it, but is very great, and worthy the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, and Angels. Firſt, if you weigh the thing it ſelf, is it not wonderful ſtrange, and unheard of in the world, that the Creator ſhould unite Himſelf with the creature? The LORD of glory, with worms? The King of Heaven, with duſt, and aſhes? The Saint of Saints, with ſinners? Then again, if you conſider, the foundation of this Union; what can be conceived of a more raviſhing nature, than the birth, and the death of the Son of GOD, upon which this Divine allia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e was contracted, this myſtical Spouſe having had ſo vehement a paſſion for the Church, that to make her His, He made Himſelf a man like us, and ſhed out all His blood upon a Croſs? If you contemplate the form, and manner of this Union; it is ſo ſtrict, and intimate, that it perfectly mingleth together the parties, whom it doth unite, and makes them one only body, one fleſh, and one Spirit; joyning both their perſons, and their affairs, and in ſuch manner confounding their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, that JESUS CHRIST is wholly His Churches, and the Church wholly Her CHRIST's. The firmneſs of this Union is no leſs admirable; being ſuch, as all the powers of the Earth, of Hell, or of Heaven, are not able to diſſolve it; and whereas Nature hath bound nothing, in the whole Univerſe, but time doth loſe it in the end; the ſacred claſps of this, the Churches eternal Union with her LORD, ſhall never be undone, either in this world, or in that which is to come, by any of thoſe innumerable ages, that ſhall roul forth. Finally, if you reſpect the effects of it; what can be mentioned of more glorious, and ſaving import, than the fruits, this Union doth produce? It filleth our underſtanding with light; it purifies our affections; it ſanctifies our hearts; it keepeth the peace of GOD in them; it changeth ſlaves of Devils, into Children of the moſt High; it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth Earth into Heaven; and inſtead of that death, and curſe, which we deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it giveth us eternity, and glory. For 'tis from it alone, that all thoſe Divine graces do flow down, which we enjoy in this world, and all the advantages, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities, we hope for, in the other. It need be no wonder therefore, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth make uſe of ſo many different reſemblances, to figure out to us ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and ſo rich a ſubject, there being to be found, no one ſo accompliſhed, as might ſingly ſuffice to repreſent us all the marveils of it. For this cauſe it borroweth, to expreſs this ſame one, all the unions that nature, or art, or humane ſociety doth afford us; comparing it ſometimes, to the Union of a Vine, with its branches, or of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50919:42"/>an Olive, with the graffs, that are ſet into its ſlock: ſometimes to the knitting of a Foundation, with the building, which it beareth; or of a corner ſtone, with the two walls, which it binds together; ſometimes to the conjunction of a Prince, with His ſubjects, or of an elder brother, with the younger, or of an husband with his wife. But among all theſe ſacred pictures of our union with the LORD, there is hardly any more proper, or more genuine, than the two ſimilitudes, which the LORD, my Brethren, now ſets before you; the one, in thoſe words of His Apoſtle, which we have read to you; and the other, on that ſacred Table, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are invited to the feaſt of His Lamb. The firſt is drawn, from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral union of the head, with its members; and the ſecond, from the union of bread, and drink, with the bodies, which are nouriſhed thereby. By reaſon of the one, CHRIST is our head, and we His body. By reaſon of the other, He is called our bread, our meat, and our drink, and we the creatures, whom He feedeth, and quickneth. And though in other reſpects, theſe two images be very different, yet in this particular, they agree: that they excellently repreſent to us, both our union with the LORD, and the life, which is thence derived to us: it being clear, that as well the head, as the food, doth, each of them, give life, to the bodies, with which they are united. This hath induced me to believe, that the meditation of this Text will be uſeful, for the Sacrament of the LORD's Supper; for which we prepare our ſelves; ſince for the main, it ſets before our eyes, though under a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſemblance, that ſame myſterie of our union with the LORD, which is repreſented, and communicated to us, at His holy Table. For the Apoſtle, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his deſign, and fully ſhew us the infinite excellence, and dignity of JESUS CHRIST our Saviour; after He hath told us, what He is, in regard of the Father, namely, <hi>the image of the inviſible GOD;</hi> and what, in regard of the works of the firſt Creation, to wit, <hi>the firſt-born</hi> (that is, the Prince, and Maſter) <hi>of all the Creatures,</hi> as having <hi>created them all,</hi> made, and formed them, from the very loweſt, to the higheſt of them: the Apoſtle, I ſay, after this diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conſiders Him finally, in regard of the new Creatures that be, that is to ſay, the Church; and informs us, that <hi>He is the head thereof, and the Church His body:</hi> and for the greater illuſtration of it, adds moreover, that <hi>He is the beginning,</hi> and the <hi>firſt-born from the dead;</hi> whence he deduceth this concluſion, that ſo <hi>He hath the firſt place in all things.</hi> Theſe are the three points, which we purpoſe, the Grace of GOD aſſiſting, to treat of, in this action, for the expoſition of this Text, and your edification; The firſt, that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the head of the body of the Church.</hi> The ſecond, that <hi>He is the beginning, and the firſt-born from the dead;</hi> and the third, and laſt, that <hi>He hath the firſt place in all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the firſt of theſe three points; it is not here alone, that the Apoſtle calleth JESUS CHRIST, <hi>the head of the Church.</hi> He uſeth the ſame language, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe other places of His Epiſtles; as in that, he writes to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1.22, 23.</note> where he ſaith, that <hi>the Father hath ſet His Son above all things, to be head of the Church; which is His body, the fulneſs of Him that filleth all in all;</hi> and elſewhere again, that <hi>CHRIST is the head, from whom the whole body fitly joyned together,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Col. 1.24.</note> ſpeaking to the faithful, <hi>You are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the body of CHRIST,</hi> and members, each one on his part. In truth, it is a figure very common in all languages, to call him, the <hi>Head of a Society,</hi> who guideth, and governeth it; or who at leaſt, poſſeſſeth the firſt place in it. As you ſee, that every one calls a King, the Head of His Eſtate; and a General, the Head of the Army, wherein he commandeth; and thoſe, the Heads of their Regiments, or Companies, who have the leading of them. Whence comes our vulgar word Captain, which, according to its derivation, ſignifies nought elſe, but the Head. The maſter of an houſhold, is in like manner termed the Head of it; and ſo in all other ſocieties of what nature ſoever they be. But this manner of ſpeaking is exceedingly familiar with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as you may ſee in very many places of the Old Teſtament, where every thing, that hath the firſt place, whether i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:50919:43"/>be for its authority, or for its excellency, or even for its birth, and meer precedency in time, is called the head of other things of the ſame kind. And the reaſon of this figure is evident. For the head ſtanding higheſt, of all the parts of the body of man; and having the conduct of it; becauſe it is the ſeat of the eyes, and other ſenſes, upon which the directing of our life dependeth; the name thereof is very juſty uſed, to ſignifie, by way of ſimilitude, whatſoever holdeth the firſt place in any ſociety, and which conſequently hath, in this reſpect, a manifeſt reſemblance of the Head, properly ſo called. It need not therefore be thought ſtrange, that this holy Apoſtle, makes uſe of this figure, to expreſs the ſuperiority, the dignity, and imperial power, which JESUS CHRIST hath over the Church, ſaying, that <hi>He is the Head thereof.</hi> And ſure if there be a ſuperiour in the whole univerſe, who may, and ought to be called, head of the ſociety which is under him, JESUS CHRIST doth merit it infinitely beyond any other; there being none at all, in whom the reaſons, and reſpects, which are neceſſary for the founding of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, are ſo clearly found, as in Him. For all the qualities, actions, and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proper to the head of the body of man; which give it its name, and dignity, JESUS CHRIST hath, and doth exerciſe them much more nobly, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently, than any General in reference to His army, or any Monarch in reference to His State. The firſt, and moſt known office, which the head doth the members, is that it directs, and guides them in their operations; and governs their motion, and their reſt, by the light of its eyes, and the perceptions of its other ſenſes, Now Princes, and Captains have ſome ſhadow of this perfection, in that, they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and obſerve, and ſent at diſtance, the things that concern thoſe bodies, over which they preſide, watching, and viewing all, that reſpects their intereſts; while their people, mean time, quietly labour, each of them in his own employment. But JESUS CHRIST doth theſe offices to His Church much better, and more perfectly. For it's in Him, that all the light of this myſtical body doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. He conſidereth, not only its intereſts in general; He knoweth all, that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the leaſt of His members. He never ſlumbereth, nor ſleepeth. He hath eyes, and ſenſes alwayes open. He ſeeth all the parts of this His State; and diſcerneth the poſture, and diſpoſition of all, that is its friend, or foe, be it neerer hand, or further off. He charily preſerves it, by this Providence of His; governing it ſo prudently, that there is no danger, from which He doth not deliver it; nor any difficulty, but He ſurmounteth it. It is He that ordereth His people warrs, and over-ruleth their fights, and diſpenſeth their truces, and will one day give them an entire, and eternal peace. The ſecond duty, the Head performs to the body, is, that it influxeth into all the members of it, all the motion, and ſenſation, that they have, by means of the animal ſpirits, which from the head, as from their ſpring, do ſpread themſelves through the whole body, flowing in the nerves, as in ſo many channels, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath cut out, and laid forth for the maintaining of this communication. And I acknowledge, that the authority, and powers, which a Prince diſtributeth into all the parts of His State, and which cauſe His ſubjects to act diverſly, each one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree; they receive thereof, I acknowledge; I ſay, this is a very good reſemblance of the way of the heads governing the body. But it is far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, what we find in the LORD JESUS His conduct, towards His Church. For He enliveneth all the members of it, from the greateſt, even to the leaſt; and gives them, not the power, and authority only, as Princes give their ſubjects; but the very ſtrength, and ability to act; communicating to each of His faithful ones, ſuch a meaſure of His Spirit, as is neceſſary for ſenſation, and motion, and all the other functions of heavenly life: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and more at large in the Firſt to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 1 Cor. 12.</note> Moreover, the Head hath this advantage, above the reſt of the body, that it is of a more exquiſite conſtitution, and temper, than the other members, according to the rule, that nature prudently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in general, which is, to frame thoſe things beſt, that are deſigned to the choi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſt employments. Kings, and Captains do deſerve alſo the name of Heads, in this reſpect, their dignity being very high-raiſed, above their ſubjects. But their advantage, in this particular, is nothing, in compariſon of that, which JESUS CHRIST hath, above His Church; not only, by His being incomparably more
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50919:43"/>holy, more wiſe, and more powerful, than any of all the faithful: but eſpecially, in that He is GOD bleſſed for ever. Finally, as you ſee, the Head is placed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the body of man; this ſcituation being neceſſary, for its commodious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the functions of its government; a thing, that Kings, and Princes imitate, dwelling ordinarily in Palaces, and ſitting on Thrones, raiſed above the houſes, and ſeats of their ſubjects: ſo JESUS CHRIST hath this advantage, but in a far greater degree; ſitting on high, in the Heavens, upon the Throne of GOD, above the whole Church, both militant, and triumphant. And whereas He converſed ſometime on earth, that was only for a while, and by diſpenſation, for the good of His body, which obliged Him to do it: even as the head boweth down it ſelf ſomtimes, when the neceſſity of any of its members doth require it. But the proper, and natural place of JESUS CHRIST is that lofty Sanctuary of immortality, where He now appears in higheſt glory; from thence governing, by His Spirit, all the parts of this myſtical body of the Church, both thoſe that are in Heaven, and thoſe that are yet on earth. Thus, My Brethren, you ſee, wherein this dignity of our LORD JESUS doth conſiſt, and with how much reaſon, St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it here, and otherwhere, by ſaying, that <hi>He is the head of the Church.</hi> Whence evidently follows, what the Apoſtle alſo evidently ſays, that <hi>the Church is the body of CHRIST.</hi> For if JESUS CHRIST be call'd the Head thereof, for having, and exerciſing towards it, all the functions, and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of a natural Head towards its members; it is clear, that the Church muſt alſo be called His body: ſince this whole Divine ſociety depends on JESUS CHRIST and receives of Him all the light, all the aptitude, all the ſenſe, and motion that it hath.</p>
                     <p>Upon this doctrine of the Apoſtle, we have divers things to conſider, before we paſs any further. Firſt, by fixing this poſition, he timely fortifies the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> againſt that errour, which we ſhall find Him expreſly oppoſing hereafter; the errour of thoſe, that would ſubject the faithful to Angels, and to <hi>Moſes,</hi> introducing into the Church, the worſhipping of the one, and the Pedagogy of the other. For ſince the Son of GOD is the Head of this ſacred ſociety, who ſeeth not, that it ought to depend on Him alone? that 'tis to Him, it oweth its obedience, and ſervice? and of Him, it ought to receive, its diſcipline, and guidance? But it muſt alſo be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Apoſtle giveth this title to JESUS CHRIST, with a deſign to glorifie Him, enroling it among the other praiſes of His Soveraign dignity. Indeed, ſince the Church is the moſt Divine ſociety in the world; ſince it is acompany of Kings, of Prieſts, and of Prophets; the Aſſembly of the firſt-fruits, and a new world much more excellent than the old, a world immortal, and incorruptible; it is evident, that to be the Head thereof, is a quality more ſublime, then to have been the Creator, and Prince of the Univerſe at firſt. Whereby you ſee, in the third place, how unrighteous (to ſay no more) the raſhneſs of thoſe is, who give this name to another, beſide JESUS CHRIST acknowledging a mortal man for the true Head of the univerſal Church. Let them colour this uſurpation, how they will; they ſhall not be able to juſtifie it. This is evidently to deſpoil JESUS CHRIST of His royal robe, and to take the Diadem from Him, which none but He can bear. They alledge, that the Scripture verily communicates to others, beſide JESUS CHRIST, the names of <hi>Paſtor,</hi> of <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and of <hi>Teacher,</hi> and of <hi>Light,</hi> and ſuch others. It is true; but it never gives that of <hi>Head of the Church</hi> to any but Him, And the difference of theſe titles is evident; the former ſignifying charges, whereof the faithful do exerciſe ſome portion, and ſome ſhadow; whereas that, of <hi>Head of the Church</hi> ſignifies, the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which is incommunicable to any other, but the Son of GOD. As you ſee, that in a State, the name of Prince, and of Governour, and Captain, and others of like ſort, are not given to the King only; they pertain to others alſo: But no other may be called the Soveraign, or the Head of the State, beſides Him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incurring the guilt of Sacriledge, or Treaſon. Yet they endeavour to excuſe them, and ſay, they make the Pope but the miniſterial, and ſubordiate Head, not an eſſential, and ſoveraign one. But this is nothing, but words ariſing from their intereſt, and not founded in the truth of things. There is no Prince, that would be ſatisfied with ſuch language, if any one of his ſubjects, that had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the head, and Monarch of His State, ſhould alledge for his excuſe, that he had
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50919:44"/>no intention, ſave to paſs for a miniſterial head. In the nature of men, whence this ſimilitude is taken, we ſee no bodies, that have two heads of a different rank: and if any ſuch be found at any time, they are accounted for monſters; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid of the Church, the moſt perfect maſter-piece, of all the works of GOD. In a word, it is not enough to ſay, that the Pope is the miniſterial head of the Church; it muſt be proved. We plainly read in Scripture, that JESUS CHRIST is Head of the Church. Let us believe it, and adore Him under that quality. But that there is another head in the Church, be he viſible, or inviſible, be he miniſterial, or ſoveraign; this we meet not with at all, in the writings of the Apoſtles; not to ſay, that we meet with divers things in them, wherewith ſuch a doctrine is incompatible. <hi>Faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of GOD.</hi> Let it therefore be permitted us, to ſuſpend our believing this other pretended head of the Church, ſince we have heard nothing of it, in the word of GOD. But that, which the Apoſtle addeth, namely, that <hi>the Church is the body of CHRIST,</hi> this further clearly ſheweth, that none but CHRIST is the Head of it. For if the Pope, for example, were head of it, the univerſal Church, ſhould be the Popes body, as it is the LORD's. But where is the Chriſtian ear, that doth not tingle at ſo ſtrange, ſo unheard of, and ſo profane language? And ſo we ſee, how vehement, and inordinate ſoever the paſſion of men hath been, for this title of <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> no man hath ever hitherto called the Church <hi>His body;</hi> every one confeſſing, that it is no ones body, but JESUS CHRIST's alone. They ſhould then grant in like manner, that none is its Head, but He only, Since it cannot have any for Head, but Him, whoſe body it is. In the next place, note I pray, in oppoſition to another error of the ſame adverſaries of ours, that CHRIST His being <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> doth not at all infer, that the Church toucheth Him corporeally, or that the bodies of the faithful are properly, and ſubſtantially joyned to Him; as the members of a natural body are joyned to their head: Every one confeſſeth, that this muſt be underſtood figuratively, and myſtically; and after the ſame manner, all men take the other expreſſions for the moſt part, by which our union with the LORD is repreſented; as when He is called <hi>the Foundation of the Church, the corner ſtone, the vine-ſtock of the Faithful,</hi> and <hi>their raiment.</hi> No one concludeth, that it is neceſſary, for the verifying of theſe paſſages, our bodies ſhould really touch His ſubſtance. Why then will they infer it, from other places, where, to ſet forth the ſame myſterie, it is ſaid, that <hi>He is our bread, our meat, and our drink?</hi> If He be our <hi>Head,</hi> if He be our <hi>Raiment,</hi> if He govern, and clothe us, without touching our bodies with His; why may not He be our bread, and nouriſh us, without real entring into our bodily throat, and ſtomach? If the one be myſtically, and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively underſtood; why will you force me, to take the other corporally, and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally? I ſay the ſame, upon the Apoſtles expreſs declaring, that <hi>the Church is the body of CHRIST.</hi> Our adverſaries do conclude no Tranſubſtantion from hence; and they confeſs, that for ſalving the truth of theſe words, there is no need, that either the Church ſhould loſe its own ſubſtance, and nature; or be really changed into the ſubſtance of the body of CHRIST. Nevertheleſs, they will by all means have it, that the ſame words, when the Goſpel ſaith of the bread, which our LORD took, that it is the <hi>body of CHRIST.</hi> As if it were not rational, and eaſie to ſay, that the bread, as well as the Church, is the body of CHRIST figuratively, and in a myſtical way. If they admit this ſenſe, in one of theſe places, why do they reject it in the other; where the nature of things themſelves, and the truth of heavenly doctrine doth no leſs neceſſarily require it? In fine, not to make any longer ſtay here, St. <hi>Paul</hi> cleareth up to us, in two words, another queſtion, which the paſſion of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſo horribly embroyled, in theſe latter times, namely, what is the nature, and the true definition of the Church. <hi>The Church is,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the body of CHRIST.</hi> Theſe two words overthrow, all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophizing of our adverſaries, about this ſubject, in order, either to the ſtraitning, or enlarging, the Communion of the Church, beyond what ought to be. I ſay, the ſtraitning; For they admit to the poſſeſſing of this name, thoſe only, that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> alloweth it to all thoſe that belong to JESUS CHRIST; and that have His Spirit; no one of theſe, but being of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50919:44"/>His body, and by conſequent of His Church, in whatever place, and under whatever Paſtors, he live. I ſay alſo, the enlarging it: For theſe Doctors, who are ſo ſevere on one hand, as that they give the name of the Church, only to the Roman Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; are ſo looſe, and ſo very indulgent on the other hand, as they yield it up to the moſt deſperate, and prophane Hypocrites that are, provided, they addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Pope; not requiring, as they affirm,

There is no communion between CHRIST, and Belial. The body, and the members of the one, cannot be the body, and members of the other. Foraſmuch as the Church is the body of CHRIST, it muſt of neceſſity be concluded, that theſe people, of whom our adverſaries compoſe their Church, which have not, as they ſay, any piety, or internal vertue, and by conſequence are members of <hi>Belial,</hi> may well be, ſince they will have it ſo, true members of the Roman, but aſſuredly not of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church; And if the Pope do own them for his ſheep; we are very certain, that the LORD JESUS will never avouch them for His.</p>
                     <p>But it is time, to come to the two other titles, which the Apoſtle here giveth, in the next place, to our LORD JESUS CHRIST, adding, that <hi>He is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or the principle, and this firſt-born from the dead.</hi> Even as, when he had ſaid before, that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is, the firſt-born,</hi> (that is, the Lord) <hi>of every creature,</hi> he preſently brought the reaſon of it, taken from thence, that all things were created by Him. In like manner now, having ſaid, that <hi>He is the Head of the Church,</hi> he foundeth this truth upon His being, the author of the Church; He that formed, and conſtituted it, and the Prince of this new generation, He that will give it the true, and utmoſt perfection of its being. For the word, which we have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, the <hi>beginning,</hi> ſignifies alſo, the <hi>principle,</hi> that is to ſay, the cauſe, and origine of a thing; and <hi>firſt-born</hi> denoteth likewiſe, both Him, who is born before the reſt, and him who is the Maſter, or the Prince of the reſt: he ſaith therefore firſt, that <hi>the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S is the beginning, or the principle.</hi> Certainly this appertaineth unto Him, upon the account of the firſt creation, inaſmuch as He is the Author of it; the <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> which did produce the Univerſe; and it may be, 'tis in this ſenſe that He calleth Himſelf, in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 3.14. &amp; 1.8 &amp; 21.6. &amp; 22.13.</note> 
                        <hi>the beginning of the creation of GOD;</hi> and elſewhere in the ſame Book, <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega, the beginning, and the end.</hi> But ſpeech here, being of the Church, and the reſurrection; the word, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> muſt be reſtrained to this matter; and we are preciſely to underſtand, that He is the beginning of this ſecond work of GOD. JESUS CHRIST, the eternal wiſdom, may ſay in reſpect of this ſecond creation, what it ſaith of the firſt, <hi>that the Father poſſeſſed Him in the begining of His ways:</hi> and that it is the ſame wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that projected, prepared, and executed, all this great deſign of the renovation of the world. Firſt, it is the Son of GOD, who intervening, at the beginning, in the counſel of the Father, took upon Him the expiating of Sin; without which, it was not poſſible to found this ſecond Frame; And though he actually did it not, till the fulneſs of time; yet His engaging His word for it, being once accepted of the Father; it had as much efficacy, as if the thing it ſelf had been then already executed, and performed; which makes the Apoſtle elſewhere ſay, that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the ſame, both yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> He hath the ſame efficacy always; as well before, as after His manifeſtation. Without this not a man could have been called into the ſtate of Grace. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in another place, that GOD hath choſen us in JESUS CHRIST; conſidering Him, as the foundation of our election, becauſe out of Him there could not be ſalvation, or happineſs for any one of us. He is therefore truly the beginning of this work; ſince His merit is the foundation of the counſel, GOD hath taken, to make, and form it: as St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo obſerves, when ſpeaking of the redemption wrought by the blood of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> he ſaith expreſly; that <hi>He was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world.</hi> But
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50919:45"/>beſide the merit of His Croſs, which was, from all time, preſent in the counſel of GOD, He is further, <hi>the beginning or the principle of the Church,</hi> another way; even by the operation, and efficacy of His power, having called unto GOD all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that ever were. It's He, that brought <hi>Abraham,</hi> out of <hi>Chaldea:</hi> It's He, that appeared to the Patriarchs, and that led <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the deſert, and that inſpired the Prophets.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.1.</note> Whence it comes, that <hi>David</hi> calls Him, his LORD. He builded, and kept up, that whole ancient Church, as well as the latter, by the vertue of His word, and Spirit. But He is again, the beginning of the Church, in the quality of a pattern, and an exemplary cauſe; the faithful of all ages, having all been, as it were, caſt into His mould, as the Apoſtle teacheth, at the eighth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> ſaying, <hi>that all thoſe whom GOD hath fore-known, He hath predeſtinated to be conformed to the image of His Son.</hi> And it's to no purpoſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; that this cannot be ſaid of that time, when He had not yet aſſumed that humane nature, tempted on earth, and crowned in Heaven, unto which we are conformed: For to this, I anſwer, firſt, that though that nature were not really yet in being, it is enough, that its idea, and image was in the mind of GOD, for the aſſimilating, and conforming His work thereto. This ſufficeth, to ſhew, that He is the beginning, and principle of it. But I adjoyn in the ſecond place, that this work, the Church, may be conſidered two wayes: either in its beginnings, while it is yet but forming; or in its perfection, as finiſhed; when it hath all the touches requiſite to ſet it in the higheſt degree of excellency, which it muſt abide in. I confeſs, the Church, under the firſt conſideration, had its being before the Son of GOD was made man, and raiſed up to Heaven: But if you take it under the ſecond, it is evident, that in this reſpect, He is truly the beginning of this Divine work. For no one was perfect before Him. He is, if I may ſo ſay, the firſt piece fully ended, that ever came out of the Fathers hand, and His own. No one of the reſt is abſolutely completed. Their bodies are yet under the power of Death, the laſt of our enemies. CHRIST is the only one, that hath altogether broken its bonds, and raiſed up His body from the grave, and clothed it with glorious immortality. He is the firſt man of the new world, that the univerſe ever ſaw; and it's in Him, hath been ſhewed us the true form of that ſecond nature, which we hope for in the time to come; but which none hath, or ſhall have for the preſent, ſave JESUS CHRIST alone. It ſeems to be this properly, that the Apoſtle here intendeth, when he calleth Him the beginning, or principle; becauſe he addeth, <hi>the firſt-born from the dead:</hi> which words, as you ſee, do evidently correſpond, with this ſenſe. St. <hi>John</hi> alſo giveth this quality to the LORD.

CHRIST the firſt-fruits; afterwards they that are CHRIST's.</hi> And otherwhere yet,
<note place="margin">Act. 26.23.</note> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it was neceſſary, that CHRIST ſhould be the firſt that roſe from the dead, who might ſhew light to the people.</hi> From all theſe places, doth ſufficiently appear, what the Apoſtle ſignifieth, when he ſaith, <hi>that JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the beginning, and the firſt-born from the dead:</hi> to wit, that He is the firſt of all mankind, who was raiſed from the ſtate of the dead, and ſetled in glorious immortality; that He is the firſt ear of this bleſſed harveſt, that was carryed up into the Sanctuary, and offered in due ſeaſon to the eternal Father, untill the reſt do become ripe. This truth is throughly evident. For of what other man, but the Lord JESUS, was it ever heard ſay, that he aroſe from the dead, and aſcended into Heaven? I know, the Scripture telleth us, of ſome dead, that were raiſed before the reſurrection of the LORD; But this deprives Him not at all of the glory, which the Apoſtle here giveth Him. For, that I may not alledge, that thoſe perſons were raiſed from the grave, not by their own force, and vertue, as JESUS CHRIST, but by the touching, or prayer of <hi>Eliah,</hi> and <hi>Eliſhah,</hi> and by GOD's command; I ſay, that the reſurrection which St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtandeth, is the riſing again unto glory, and immortality. It's a being born again, not to the former life, which is terrene, and fading: but to the other, which is celeſtial, and incorruptible. Who ſeeth not,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50919:45"/>that in this ſence, there never was, nor yet is any raiſed again, except the LORD JESUS alone? For the Son of the <hi>Shunamite, Lazarus,</hi> and the others of like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, at their coming forth of the grave, did reaſſume that ſame natural, and periſhing life, which they had laid down; a life ſubject to the ſame infirmities, and to the ſame neceſſity of dying; and indeed, they dyed after they had lived again awhile. Their death was rather deferred, than aboliſhed. Their bodies did corrupt, and in the end, return to that duſt, from which they were preſerved for ſome years. But with JESUS CHRIST it is not ſo. He in coming forth from the dead, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took not the life He had quitted, that is the life of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that infirm, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and earthly life, a life ſtill ſubject unto death. He left it in the Sepulchre, where it muſt remain, as in eternal oblivion. He put on a new life, and nature; ſuch as is ſpiritual, and celeſtial, as the Apoſtle elſewhere termeth it; a life wholly full of ſtrength, and glory; that is not ſubject, either to the uſe of meat, or ſleep: not ſubject to dolour, or death; a life appropriate to the ſecond world, and not to the firſt; a nature peculiar to the future age, not to the preſent. Accordingly you ſee, that being veſted therewith, he remained not on the earth; This is the old <hi>Adam</hi>'s element; the habitation of corruption, and death: But having only ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there fourty days, ſo long as was needful, to aſſure His Apoſtles, of the truth of His reſurrection, and to ſhew them, in His own perſon, the firſt-fruits of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Canaan;</hi> He aſcended up above the Heavens, to the true element of the new man, and the Sanctuary of eternity. Conclude we then, that <hi>He is truly, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the firſt-born from the dead;</hi> ſince He is the firſt of all the dead, that was born, and raiſed again in incorruption. But theſe titles ſignifie yet another thing, namely, that it ſhall be He, who ſhall raiſe again all the members of the Church in like glory; that He is the maſter, and the Lord of the dead, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting them one day, in their order, with a nature reſembling His own; according to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere ſaith, that <hi>He will make our vile body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>like unto His own glorious body.</hi> For He would not be, the firſt-born from the dead; if He did not communicate the priviledge, and the poſſeſſion of this ſecond birth, to all His bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that is to ſay, all the faithful. The Apoſtle adds, <hi>to the end, that He might have the firſt place in all things.</hi> Thoſe, that are well verſed, in the reading of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Books, do know, that the word, <hi>to the end that,</hi> is often put in them, for <hi>ſo as that,</hi> or <hi>in ſuch a ſort as;</hi> even to ſignifie the event, and conſequence of an action, rather than the intention, or deſign of the agent; I account, that it muſt be ſo taken in this place. For the intention of our LORD, in being made Head of the Church, and the beginning of the new life, was rather to Save us, and glorifie His Father; then to obtain unto Himſelf, the firſt place in all things. Yet true it is, that ſuch was the ſucceſs of this His undertaking, as He actually hath the firſt place in all things. For there are but two ſorts of things, one of thoſe that pert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>o the firſt world, and its creation: the other of thoſe that are of the ſecond world, and of the regeneration. CHRIST therefore being already the Maſter and Creator of the former, it is evident, that having been alſo eſtabliſhed, <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> (which is the State, that conſiſts of the latter) <hi>and the beginning, and firſt-born of the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> He doth obtain, by this means, the firſt place in all things, that is to ſay, both in thoſe of the firſt creation, whereof He is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; and in thoſe of the ſecond, whereof He is the Head. This is the concluſion, which the Apoſtle deduceth, from his whole precedent diſcourſe; there he ſaid, <hi>that the LORD is the image of the inviſible GOD, the firſt-born of every creature, the Creator of the Elements, and the Angels: and moreover the Head of the Church, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and the firſt-fruits of the new Creation;</hi> now he addeth, ſo as <hi>He hath the firſt place in all things.</hi> This being, as ſeems to me, from hence, clear enough, there is no neceſſity, we ſhould make any longer ſtay upon the expoſition of this Text.</p>
                     <p>It remains, that, to conclude, we do briefly touch at, the duties, to which the doctrine of the Apoſtle doth oblige us; and the comforts, which it doth afford us. JESUS CHRIST (ſaith he) <hi>is the head of the body of the Church.</hi> Theſe few words, if we meditate them, as we ought, will teach us all that we owe, both of obedience to the LORD, and of charity to our brethren, and of care, and reſpect to our ſelves. As for the LORD, ſince He hath vouchſafed to become our Head,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50919:46"/>it is evident, we ought to honour Him, with utmoſt devotion, and ſubmit all the actions of our life, to His conduct. See, with what promptitude, the body obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the head, and with how abſolute a ſubmiſſion it follows all its movings. The body neither ſtirreth, nor reſteth, but as the head ordereth. It depends entirely, on its guidance, and never croſſeth its orders, or reſiſteth its commands. The head hath no ſooner conceived a thing, but the ſpirits forthwith preſent themſelves at the place, it deſireth, and each of the members employeth all the vigor, and ſtrength it hath, to execute its will. This is an image of that obedience which the LORD, our myſtical Head, demands of us: and this is that, which the Apoſtle meaneth elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.24.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>that the Church is ſubject to Him.</hi> It's in vain therefore, that they boaſt themſelves, to be the Church, who do contrary to what the LORD ordaineth; who are ſubject to another, beſide Him, and inſtead of His orders, follow the will of a mortal man; owning another head, adoring another oracle, keeping, what He hath forbidden. Bleſſed be His Name, for that He hath granted us, to diſclaim their errour, and to hang all our religion upon His ſacred lips, believing only that truth, which He hath revealed to us, in His Goſpel, and engraven in our hearts by His Spirit. But what will it profit us, to follow Him in our faith, if we reſiſt, in our manners? How can he avouch for His Church, a body ſubject to Mammon, to pleaſure, to ambition, and other idols of the world? a body wholly bended down to the earth, whereas this divine Head is lift up above the Heavens? Dear Brethren, let us not deceive our ſelves. We cannot be the Church of CHRIST, except we be His body; and we cannot be His body, except we depend abſolutely on Him: except we caſt out of our members, the ſpirit of the Fleſh, and of the world, and take in His, to follow it's light, and obey it's movings. Henceforth then let us ſo compoſe our life, that it do not contradict our profeſſion. Let the LORD JESUS be, truly our Head; let Him be ſtill above us; let Him preſide in all our deſigns; let Him conduct our ſteps, and govern all our motions, and inſpire into us all the ſentiments we have, Let there appear nothing in our words, in our affections, or our works, but what is His.</p>
                     <p>But this leſſon of the Apoſtles, doth no leſs recommend to us, charity towards our neighbour, than ſubmiſſion towards JESUS CHRIST. For ſince the Church is a body, and even the body of CHRIST: that is, the faireſt, and moſt perfect body, in the world; judge ye, what ought to be the union, and the love of all the faithful, that compoſe it? Look upon the body of man, from which this reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance is taken; how great is the zeal of all the parts, for the conſervation of the whole? How do they love it, and conſpire for it's good; how do they do, and ſuffer all things: and each in it's rank, expoſe their life, and being for it? Such, ye Faithful, ought to be your affection for the Church; this Divine body of the LORD, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you are members. Its peace, its preſervation, and its glory, ſhould be the object of your higheſt, and moſt urgent defires. There is nothing, that ſhould not be cheerfully employed in ſo brave a deſign. Wo to them, that have no feeling of the wounds of this ſacred body; that are not affected with its bruiſes, and look upon the breaches of it, unmoved; who are ſo far from groaning at them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to repair them: that themſelves make more; rending with extream impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inhumanity, the moſt innocent body in the world, and moſt beloved of GOD; the body of His Son, which He hath redeemed, at the price of His own Blood. But beſides the affection, we ought to have, for the Church in general, this ſimilitude advertiſeth us alſo, to love ardently each of the faithful in particular. St. <hi>Paul</hi> toucheth at, and treateth of this advice expreſly, in another place; <hi>There is no diviſion in the body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.25, 26.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>the members have a mutual care one of another; and if one of the members ſuffer any thing, all the members ſuffer with it: or if one of the members be honoured, all the members rejoyce together in it. Now ye are the body of CHRIST, and His members each one on his part.</hi> O GOD! how great would be our happineſs, and our glory, if the union, and concord of our flock did anſwer this fair, and rich picture? if knit together by an holy, and inviolable love, and having but one heart, and one ſoul, as we have, but one Head, we did amiably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe together, tenderly reſenting the good, and evil of each other, and each of us putting forth his power to conſerve, and encreaſe the good of our brethren, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50919:46"/>to comfort, and cure their evils? But alas! inſtead of this ſweet, and grateful ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, which would raviſh heaven and earth, we behold nothing among us, but quarrels, and coldneſs, and hatred, and animofities. The welfare of our brethren diſpleaſeth us, and their ill caſe toucheth us not at all. The former raiſeth our envy, and the latter ſtirreth not our compaſſion. Vanity, and the love of our ſelves, make us either diſdain, or hate all others. There are no bonds, which our fierceneſs doth not break; it equally violates, both thoſe of nature, and thoſe of grace. Is this that great name, of the body of CHRIST, which we glory to be called by? CHRIST is nothing but ſweetneſs, and love. He hath laid down His life for His enemies. How are we His, we that hate, and perſecute our brethren? And how are we His body, ſince we rend one another? Were ever the members of the ſame body, ſeen at war together, the hand aſſaulting the foot, and the teeth falling on the hand? If any ſuch thing appear, is it not taken for the effect of an extream rage, or for an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible prodigy? Oh! how ordinary is this rage, and this prodigy among us? who being members of the ſame body, and (which infinitely augmenteth our ſhame) of the body of CHRIST, the Saviour of the world, have yet no horrour at the biting, and conſuming of one another, as if we were an herd of <hi>Canibals,</hi> and not the flock of the Lord JESUS. I well know, we do not want plauſible reaſons, to palliate each of us our faults, paſſion it ſelf making us witty, in the defence of this bad cauſe. But let our own conſcience be our judge, let it remember, it hath to do with JESUS CHRIST, and not with men: if it beguile us, it cannot deceive GOD. Renounce we then unfeignedly, all this kind of vices; and cordially loving our Brethren, ſuccouring the afflicted, aſſiſting the poor, comforting the ſick, and living in concord with all, let us truly be, as we ſay we are, the body of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. It's this in particular, that the bread, and the wine, of our LORD, the ſacred embleme of our myſtical union, do require of us: they mind us, that we are but one bread, and one body, as the Apoſtle repreſents it,
<note place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, this doctrine further ſheweth us, with what purity, and ſanctity, we ought to keep our own perſons, ſince all being the body of CHRIST, we are, each one, members of Him. Againſt every temptation, that ſin ſhall let fly at us, let us take up this conſideration, for our ſuccour: ſay, ſhall I take the members of CHRIST, to make of them members of Satan? Shall I defile that body, in the ordure of incontinency, or of drunkenneſs, or any other debauches, which the Son of GOD hath cleanſed with His blood? which He hath united, and joyned to Himſelf? and whereof He is become their Head? Far be it from me, to commit ſo vile a fact. It's thus, My Brethren, that we ought to regulate our whole life, for the being truly, the body of CHRIST. And if we ſo be, this Divine Head (doubt it not) will love us, and tenderly preſerve us. For no one ever yet hated his own fleſh; He will feed us, and ſet us at His own Table, and give us the bread, and wine of Heaven; and after the combats, and trials of this life, will clothe us with His own glory, and immortality, as being <hi>the firſt-born from the dead.</hi> To Him with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, the true GOD, bleſſed for ever, be honour, and glory to ages, of ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>EVen as in the frame of Nature, GOD hath ſet up one only principle of light, namely the Sun, and hath united, in the body of this admirable luminary, all the brightneſs, that was ſpred through the univerſe, that it might enlighten the Heavens, and the earth, and that from it, as from a common ſource, might ſtream forth into all things, all the flame, and warmth they do receive: ſo likewiſe in the Kingdom of Grace, the ſame GOD hath given us one JESUS CHRIST alone, the true Sun of righteouſneſs, whom He hath filled, with all the treaſures of wiſdom, and life, that He might be as an exceeding abundant, and inexhauſtible fountain of joy, and immortality; whence are diffuſed, upon all the parts of the new world, which is created in righteouſneſs, and in holineſs, all the ſpiritual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and benedictions they have. This is that, Dear Brethren, which the Apoſtle divinely teacheth us, in the Text, you have now heard: wherein, ſpeaking of the LORD JESUS, he ſaith, <hi>it was the good pleaſure of the Father, that in Him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> He repreſented to us, in the precedent words, the excellency of the Lord JESUS's perſon; in that He is the Image of GOD, the Lord, and the Creator of all things, viſible, and inviſible; then next, His dignity, in that He is the Head of the Church, the beginning, and the firſt-born from the dead; concluding, that He hath the firſt place in all things. The Apoſtle now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the reaſon of it, taken from the decree, and will of the Eternal Father. For <hi>it was His good pleaſure,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that in Him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> And that we might diſcern, the wiſdom of the Father, in this diſpoſal of the thing, he ſets before us, in the words following, the work, for the effecting whereof, He defigned, and ſent His Son, a work ſo great, and ſo wonderful, as it is evident, that without this fulneſs, which He cauſed to dwell in Him, it was not poſſible, it ſhould be brought to an end. For it is by Him, that He purpoſed to reconcile, and actually did reconcile all things in Himſelf, as well thoſe, that are in Heaven; as thoſe, that are in earth. And for the more full diſcovery, of the greatneſs of this Divine maſter-piece, he toucheth alſo at the means, by which it was accompliſhed, to wit, <hi>Peace,</hi> which he made by the blood of His Son's Croſs. It was not poſſible, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite Heaven, and Earth, and reconcile theſe parts of the Univerſe, that were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded each from other, but by making peace, by extinguiſhing their hate, and removing the cauſe of their enmities; Neither was it any more poſſible, to procure this peace, otherways, then by the ſhedding of a Divine blood, and the offering up a ſacrifice of infinite worth, and by the intervention of a Mediator, who ſhould have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50919:47"/>in him, all the perfections, and excellencies of the parties, that were to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. The greatneſs of the work, ſhews us the quality of the means, that was requiſite to finiſh it; and the quality of the means, doth regulate the faculties, and nature of the perſon, that was neceſſary to do it. To reconcile earthly, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things in GOD, there was need to make peace; To make peace, there was need of a blood, and a ſacrifice of infinite value; To offer ſuch a ſacrifice, there was need of a perſon, in whom all fulneſs dwelt; that is, who had in Him fully and perfectly, all the graces, and excellencies of Heaven, and Earth. Certainly then, it was an order highly reaſonable, and moſt worthy of the Divine wiſdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make all fulneſs dwell in His CHRIST for the reconciling of Heaven, and earth by making peace through the blood of His croſs. That we may have the fuller view of it, for His glory, and our own conſolation, we will conſider, by His grace, in this action, thoſe three points, that are diſtinctly propoſed us, in the Apoſtles Text. Firſt, <hi>the good pleaſure of the Father, that all fulneſs ſhould dwell in CHRIST.</hi> Secondly, the work He hath wrought, by the hand of His CHRIST thus furniſhed; namely, <hi>the reconciling of all things in Himſelf, as well thoſe, that are in earth, as thoſe, that are in Heaven;</hi> and finally, the means, by which He hath executed this great deſign, to wit, <hi>making peace, by the blood of the croſs of His well-beloved Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a right underſtanding of the firſt of theſe three points, we muſt enquire, at our entrance, what this fulneſs is, which the good pleaſure of the Father hath made, to dwell wholly in CHRIST; eſpecially ſeeing that Interpreters do not well accord, about it. Some referring it, to the Divinity of our LORD: others, to the graces which were accumulated on Him, after His manifeſtation in our fleſh. It is certain, that the word, Fulneſs, is variouſly taken in the Scripture; and not to ſpeak of other ſenſes it hath, which are beſide our purpoſe, it is ſomtimes referred to the greatneſs of things, and ſignifies, their juſt; their whole, and due meaſure. As when it is ſaid, <hi>that</hi> Saul <hi>fell on the earth, to the fulneſs of his ſtature;</hi> that is, all along,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> ſo as his whole body lay ſtretcht out on the ground; and it is very likely, that it is thus, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Church, <hi>the fulneſs, or the compleatneſs of CHRIST;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1.23,</note> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as being His body, 'tis in it, that His juſt, and due magnitude conſiſteth. Without the Church, He would be an Head without a body, that is, withot a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, and a ſtature proportionate to His ſupereminent Majeſty. It ſeemeth, we might ſo take, the Fulneſs, mentioned in this Text; even, as ſignifying all the graces, and excellencies requiſite to the full, and entire greatneſs, that becomes the CHRIST of GOD; but the word, <hi>Dwell,</hi> which is annexed to it, doth not comport with it. For it would be an harſh phraſe, and without example in any language, to ſay, that a man's ſtature dwelleth in him. Upon the ſame conſideration, I exclude hence another ſence, which elſe would ſute not ill, with the matter; I mean that, which the term fulneſs hath, when it is put for a full, and whole meaſure, and ſuch as wanteth nothing. We are to obſerve therefore, beſide what hath been ſaid, that the word, <hi>fulneſs,</hi> doth very commonly, in Scripture, ſet forth that, which filleth any thing; as when one Prophet calleth men, and other creatures, which the earth is full of, <hi>the fulneſs of the earth;</hi> and another, <hi>the fulneſs of a City,</hi> all the people,

Its in this ſence, that the Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> gives the name of, <hi>the Fulneſs of CHRIST,</hi> to that total abundance of perfections, and divine graces, which dwelt in Him, His wiſdom, His juſtice, His ſanctification, and His redemption, when he ſaith, that <hi>of His fulneſs, we all have received.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 1.16.</note> And it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50919:48"/>is after the ſame manner, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> hereafter, <hi>by the fulneſs of the Godhead,</hi> meaneth all the qualities or properties of the Divine Nature; its Underſtanding, its Wiſdom, its Omnipotency, it's Goodneſs, and Infinite Juſtice, ſaying, <hi>That in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 2.9.</note> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this ſenſe alſo, as ſeems to me, that we muſt take the word <hi>Fulneſs</hi> in this Text; referring it to the things whereof the Apoſtle had even now ſpoken, when he affirmed, <hi>That JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the Image of the inviſible GOD; the Firſt-born of every creature, by whom all things were created, and do ſubſiſt; the Head of the Church, the Beginning, and the Firſt-born from the dead, holding the firſt place in all things.</hi> For theſe qualities, as you ſee, are the perfections and excellencies partly of the Divine Nature, and partly of the Humane; the former, namely, <hi>His being the Image of GOD,</hi> and the Maſter and Author of the Creatures, pertaining to the Divine; the latter, to wit, <hi>His being the Head of the Church, and the Firſt-born from the dead,</hi> to the Humane; ſo as when the Apoſtle, after theſe things, addeth now, <hi>For it was the good pleaſure of the Father, that in Him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> it is as much as if He had ſaid, For it was the Fathers will, that there ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in His CHRIST a rich, and a compleat abundance of all? Divine and Humane perfections; all the beauty, dignity and excellency that repleniſheth heaven and earth, that adorneth the nature of GOD, and of men. And ſo the queſtion which Interpreters debate, whether this <hi>Fulneſs</hi> ſhould be referred to the Divinity, or to the Humanity of our LORD, is cleared; for this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition comprizeth them both, the eternal Wiſdom and Power of the one, with all its attributes; the Sanctity and Charity of the other, with all the graces which have been given it, without meaſure. This is the All-fulneſs that dwelleth in JESUS CHRIST. And the word <hi>Dwelleth,</hi> hath here a great deal of Emphaſis. For in the ſtile of Scripture, it ſignifies an abode, not tranſient, and for a time only; but ſuch as is firm, conſtant and durable: So that the Apoſtle ſaying, <hi>That all fulneſs dwelleth in CHRIST,</hi> doth thereby ſhew us, that this rich abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all Divine and Humane perfections, ſhall eternally be in Him; not as the Divine Glory and Majeſtie erewhile, was in the Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> where it lodg'd but for a ſpace; not as the irradiations of the Deity in the ſouls of the Prophets, which they fill'd but for ſome hours; finally, not as the graces and perfections, that do for ſome years only, enrich the bodies and ſpirits of mortal men, old age, and a thouſand other accidents, and in the end death it ſelf, quickly deſpoiling them of the ſame; which makes the ſacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſay, that the comlineſs of fleſh, and the faſhion of this world paſſeth away, and that it is like to flowers and herbs, in whom beauty tarrieth but a few days; time, without delay, plucking it from them, and defacing all the lineaments of it. Our CHRIST is an eternal Temple, which the Glory of GOD filleth both continually, and for ever. It doth not meerly lodge there; it dwelleth there as in its true and incorruptible Sanctuary. Never ſhall the ſame be void of it. This <hi>Fulneſs</hi> ſhall abide eternally in Him. But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That it was the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Father, that this fulneſs ſhould dwell in Him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By the good pleaſure of the Father,</hi> he meaneth, according to the ordinary ſtile of Scripture, the determination and order of the Eternal wiſdom of GOD. For CHRIST did not violently ſnatch up this glory, nor did He aſſume it to Him of Himſelf. He receiv'd it by the will of the Father, who gave Him, and ſent Him into the world, pouring into Him all the treaſures of His graces, that we might draw from His fulneſs, all the good we need for our happineſs: But further, it muſt be remembred, that the Apoſtle conſidereth the LORD JESUS here, as CHRIST, and Mediator, and not ſimply as the Son of GOD; he conſidereth Him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of His Office, and not in reſpect to His firſt and original nature; for if you look upon Him this ſecond way, it is clear, that being GOD Eternal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, He receiv'd of Him His Divine Eſſence, with all its fulneſs, not by any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of His will, or of His good pleaſure, but by a natural communication, that is to ſay, by an Eternal, Ineffable, and Incomprehenſible generation. The Creation of the world, is a work of the good pleaſure of GOD; the Generation of the Son is a natural act of the Perſon of the Father. The firſt was done in time, the other
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50919:48"/>is before all time. The world, which is the effect of Creation, had a beginning of being; the Son, who is the fruit of the foreſaid Generation, is Eternal, without beginning, as well as without end of days. But this Son, who is GOD by nature, is CHRIST by the will of the Father, for the name CHRIST, ſignifies an Office, and not ſtrictly an Eſſence, or a Nature. Originally, this Office was not faſtned to the Perſon of the Son. He might have been the Son, without being our Mediator; and had ſubſiſted ſo indeed, if the ſin of man had not intervened; or if the Juſtice of GOD had left us in the miſery, whereinto ſin had precipitated us: But this good and gracious LORD having had compaſſion on us, and reſolved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to bring us up from thoſe deeps of death in which we lay, did ordain a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator who might effect this great work; and inveſted Him with all the qualities and perfections that were neceſſary for this end. It's therefore preciſely under this reſpect, that the Apoſtle conſiders JESUS CHRIST here, when he ſaith, <hi>It was the good pleaſure of the Father, that in Him ſhould all fulneſs dwell:</hi> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by meaneth, it was the Fathers will, that in this Sacred Perſon of the Mediator, who was eſtabliſhed and deſtinated for our ſalvation, all perfection, richneſs, grace, and excellency, ſhould meet together; Divinity and Humanity, filled with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite aboundance of all the qualities and properties, that pertain to them, concur. Such being His good pleaſure, He choſe His Son, GOD co-eternal, and co-eſſential with Himſelf, who uniting all the riches of His Deity, with the Humane nature He aſſumed, conſtituteth one only perſon; in the boſom of which, dwelleth all this fulneſs that is neceſſary for the charge of Mediator. Whence it appears, how vain the cavil of Hereticks is, who conclude from this paſſage, that the Deity of the Son is not Eternal, and co-eſſential with the,

                           </gap>.</note> Fathers, but created, and made, by the will and good pleaſure of the Father. For the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak here, of the original of the perfections that are found in CHRIST, but of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united and met together in one and the ſame ſubject. I acknowledge, it is by the good pleaſure of the Father, and by the order of His will, that the Godhead of the Son dwelleth in the Mediator. But it thence follows, that this Godhead of His, is an effect of the Fathers will. It was, before it filled the Mediator. The ſame Father, who by His will, united it to our fleſh, for the making up, together with that fleſh, the perſon of CHRIST, had communicated it to His Son from all Eternity, by a natural act of His Eternal underſtanding, that is to ſay, by a Divine Generation. Now it is not in vain, that the Apoſtle here advanceth this aſſertion, <hi>That it was the good pleaſure of the Father, all fulneſs ſhould dwell in HIS CHRIST:</hi> But he doth it, with deſign to
<note n="*" place="margin">Or ſettle.</note> confirm our Conſciences, in the Religion of the LORD JESUS only. For theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> (as we ſhall ſee hereafter) were tamper'd with by Seducers, who mingled the Moſaical Ceremonies with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the worſhipping of Angels, with the ſervice of the LORD; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle therefore, doth here timely fortifie theſe Believers againſt this error; and that by two excellent Reaſons; the firſt taken from <hi>the dwelling of all fulneſs in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> Poor men, ſaith he, what ſeek you for, either in <hi>Moſes</hi> or in Angels? we have all in JESUS CHRIST. There is no good, no perfection, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, either in GOD, or in the Creature, but dwelleth in this Soveraign LORD. Having Him, we have no need at all to go unto others; ſince in Him we find all. The other Reaſon is taken from the Will of GOD, the ſupreme rule of Religion; the only thing that is ſufficient to ſettle the agitation, and natural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of our Conſciences. As for JESUS CHRIST (ſaith he) <hi>it was the good pleaſure of GOD, that in Him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> The Father hath ſet up Him, to be the ſpring of our ſalvation. But as for <hi>Moſes</hi> and Angels, we do not ſee, that ever it was the will of the Father to give them ſuch a dignity. Dear Brethren, now that our faith is fought againſt with the like errors, let us arm it alſo with the ſame reaſons. If the Adverſary ſend us to Angels and Saints; let us anſwer him, that the LORD JESUS ſufficeth us; that having Him, we can want nothing; ſince all fulneſs dwelleth in Him. I will not enquire for the preſent, what theſe Angels and Saints are, whom you recommend to me; whether they have indeed that merit, and that righteouſneſs, and that authority which I need for the expiation of my ſin, and for opening the houſe of GOD to me.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50919:49"/>How rich, and how abounding ſoever you repreſent them to me, I may let paſs their ſtore; this CHRIST, whom I embrace, having all fulneſs dwelling in Him. Let them be all that you pleaſe, they will want however ſome part of that infinite plentifulneſs, which overfloweth in our CHRIST, And how zealous ſoever you be for their glory, yet you durſt not preſume to ſay, that all fulneſs dwelleth in them. How great is your imprudence, to go hither and thither a groping in pits and ciſterns, while you have near you ſuch a living and inexhauſtible foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? Grant, that the worſhipping of Saints is not criminal (which yet it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is) it is notwithſtanding ſuperfluous; foraſmuch as it hath nothing in it, but we find the ſame better in the fulneſs of JESUS CHRIST. But the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration which the Apoſtle ſets before us here, is of no leſs force, <hi>That it was the good pleaſure of the Father, all fulneſs ſhould dwell in His CHRIST.</hi> My Faith, yea our Adverſaries attends on the will of GOD. This will is its object, and its rule. I cannot relliſh either Doctrine or Service, that is not conform thereto. Tell me, how you know it is the good pleaſure of GOD, that this fulneſs of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and power, which you aſcribe ſomtimes to Saints departed, ſomtimes to your Pope and his Miniſters, doth indeed dwell in them? As for the LORD JESUS, whom I adore, and in whom I ſeek all my bliſs, the Father hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from Heaven, <hi>That He is His welbeloved Son;</hi> His Scriptures declare, <hi>That He hath committed all judgment to Him;</hi> and, <hi>That all fulneſs dwelleth in Him.</hi> But as for thoſe others, whom you have taken for objects of your Devotion, and to whom you have recourſe for your ſalvation; you cannot ſhew me any thing ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable of them. Certainly then, it muſt be vouched, that all your Devotion in this behalf, is but a Will-worſhip, founded only on your own paſſion, and the fancy of your Leaders, not upon the good pleaſure of the Father. It is ſtrange fire, that hath iſſued out of the earth, and not been kindled from Heaven: Such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without crime, either enter into, or be uſed in the Sanctuary of GOD.</p>
                     <p>But I return to the Apoſtle, who having ſaid, <hi>That it was the good pleaſure of the Father, all fulneſs ſhould dwell in CHRIST;</hi> doth add, <hi>And by Him to reconcile all things in Himſelf; both thoſe that are in Heaven, and thoſe that are in the earth.</hi> This is the great Maſter-piece of the good pleaſure of GOD: the end for which, His will was, that the fulneſs of all Divine and Humane perfections ſhould be ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in CHRIST. And this is that, which the particle, and, uſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, doth ſignifie: It doth not meerly connect the two parts of his diſcourſe; but importeth moreover the conſecution, and the dependance of the latter on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; as if He had ſaid. It was the good pleaſure of the Father, that in JESUS CHRIST ſhould all fulneſs dwell, and ſo reconcile, or to the end that He might reconcile all things by Him. For all this fulneſs, which the Father would that His CHRIST ſhould have dwelling in Him, was neceſſary for His effecting this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. There needed he ſhould have the power, and the holineſs, and the wiſdom of the Divinity; and together with it, the humility, and the obedience, and the meritorious ſufferings of the Humanity, that he might finiſh this deſign: He could not have been able, to re-unite Heaven and Earth with leſs prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſee then what this work is, this <hi>Reconciling,</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>of all things Terreſtrial and Celeſtial, in GOD, by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> It is clear by the Scriptures, that JESUS CHEIST hath, by His death, reconciled men unto GOD, ſo as He hath appeaſed His wrath, and opened to us the Throne of His grace, as the Apoſtle teacheth us in divers places, and particularly in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5.10, 11. 2 Cor. 5.18.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>That we have been reconciled to GOD by the death of His Son,</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>That GOD hath reconciled us to Himſelf by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> But it ſeems, that this is not preciſely that Reconciliation which S. <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth here: Firſt, becauſe the things in heaven, which he expreſly puts among the parties reconciled, have no part therein; the Angels, that dwell in the Heavens, pure and holy as they are, having never fallen into any alienation from GOD. Secondly, becauſe of that Reconciliation the Apoſtle will ſpeak inſtantly, in the words immediately following, in which he ſaith, <hi>Having made peace by the blood of His croſs,</hi> ſo as the former words muſt of neceſſity be referred to ſome other
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50919:49"/>Reconciliation; except we will render the language of this Divine Writer, culpable of a vain and fruitleſs repetition. The truth is, they that underſtand theſe words of Reconciliation with GOD, do find themſelves much intangled in the matter, and have recourſe to divers means, for clearing them of this difficulty. Some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that though the Angels be holy and bleſſed, yet they were not exempt from needing the death of JESUS CHRIST, to merit and obtain their confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perſeverance in the eſtate they had; a bold Doctrine, and ſuch as it is hard to find any foundation for in the Scripture. For by this reckoning, JESUS CHRIST ſhould alſo be the Mediator of Angels; a thing, that ſeems to croſs the end, and the true nature of this Office; Firſt, becauſe a Mediator ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the nature of the parties whom he reconcileth, as you ſee, that JESUS CHRIST, the Mediator between GOD and men, is GOD and man; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as He took not the nature of Angels. Secondly, becauſe every Mediator inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneth between parties that are at difference; whereas the Angels are, and ever were at perfect accord with GOD, holily obeying His will. Laſtly, becauſe the blood of JESUS CHRIST was ſhed, only to waſh away ſin; and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every where repreſents, the people of GOD's Covenant, His redeemed ones, and thoſe whom He hath ſaved, as juſtified and cleanſed from their filth; for which there was no place in the nature of Angels; they being pure and clean from all ſin. For as to that of <hi>Job, That GOD putteth no truſt in His ſervants,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 4.18.</note> 
                        <hi>and doth ſet light by his Angels;</hi> it is evident, and acknowledged by all Chriſtians, that this is not ſaid, to accuſe thoſe bleſſed Spirits, or to ſuggeſt, that if they were tried by the ordinary and legal juſtice of GOD, they would be found guilty, and have need of pardon; but rather to ſignifie, either that the Authority of GOD over His creatures, is ſo great and ſo abſolute, as He oweth nothing to the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how exquiſite ſoever their Sanctity be; the light of glory wherewith He crowns them, being a gift from His own bounty, and not the due reward of their merit; or elſe, that the infinite purity of this Supreme Majeſtie, is ſo ſplendid and ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that the light of the moſt holy Spirits fadeth before Him, and is found dusky and defective, in compariſon of Him: as the ſhining of our lights, and of the Stars themſelves, doth diſappear at the brightneſs of the Sun. Others therefore not able to ſavour (and for juſt cauſe, I think) this Doctrine, that the Angels were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to GOD by JESUS CHRIST; to exclude them from this paſſage, do reſtrain the Apoſtle's words to men only, underſtanding by <hi>the things that are in Heaven,</hi> the already hallowed ſpirits of the faithful, which death had taken out of this world; and by <hi>the things that are on earth,</hi> the faithful that yet live here beneath in fleſh. But, not to diſſemble, this Expoſition ſeemeth both forced and frigid. Forced, becauſe the Scripture, by <hi>things in heaven,</hi> ordinarily meaneth the Angels, whoſe element, and natural habitation (as you know) the heavens are; whereas ſouls ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from their bodies, are receiv'd in and lodged there, by a Supernatural grace and diſpenſation. Frigid, becauſe the ſenſe it attributeth to the Apoſtle, no way anſwers the ſublimity and dignity of his words. For if his aim were to expreſs nothing, but that the faithful are reconciled to GOD, what need was there to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them into two ranks; ſome, that are on the earth; others, that are in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens? Who doubts, but He reconciled theſe, as well as thoſe? But without queſtion, he purpoſed to magnifie this work of GOD by JESUS CHRIST; and to this end, ſaith, that it extendeth not to men alone, that are reconciled to the Father, by the efficacy of the croſs of the LORD; but that it hath effect in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf, re-uniting and reconciling the things that are there. What ſhall we ſay then to theſe difficulties? and in what ſenſe ſhall we take the Apoſtle's words, <hi>That GOD hath reconciled all things in Himſelf, both thoſe that are on earth, and thoſe that are in heaven?</hi> Dear Brethren, we will leave them in their genuine and ordinary ſenſe, and ſay, that theſe expreſſions do ſignifie, the recompoſing and re-uniting of the creatures, both Terreſtrial and Celeſtial; not with GOD, but among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with each other. For as in a State, the Subjects have a twofold union; one with their Prince, on whom thy all depend; another among themſelves, being as members of the ſame Political Body, joyned together by the bond of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50919:50"/>concord, amity and correſpondence: In like manner is it with things Celeſtial and Terreſtrial; the two principal parties of this great State of GOD's, which we cal the Univerſe. Beſides the union they have with GOD, as their Soveraign Monarch, from whoſe bounty they receive the being and the life they enjoy; they have another alliance and conjunction one with the other, as parts of one Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, having been formed and qualified for mutual commerce. It's in this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in this union, that the beauty and perfection of the Univerſe doth conſiſt, when Heaven and earth have amicable entercourſe, and conſpire to one and the ſame end, with an holy, and a reciprocal affection. Sin having broken the firſt union, and ſeparated man from his Creator; by the ſame means diſſolved the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, looſning us from the creatures. For, as again in a ſtate, when one part of the Subjects riſeth againſt the Sovereign, the reſt that remain in their duty, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently break with the Rebels; and inſtead of the commerce they held before with them, do make cruel and implacable war upon them, while they continue in their diſobedience. Such hath the event proved in the world. Man had no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell'd againſt GOD, but heaven, and all that remained in His obedience, brake with man. Whole Nature took up arms againſt this Rebel, and would have even then utterly ruin'd him, if the Counſel of GOD, who would not deſtroy us, had not hindred it. And as from one diſorder, there never fail to ſpring up divers others; this firſt rupture of man with GOD, and the good Creatures, brought forth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others indeed, rending mankind it ſelf into ſeveral pieces; the one, divided from the other by diverſity of Religions, and the averſions and animoſities that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. Such was the ſad and diſmal eſtate of the world; the end whereof could be nothing elſe, but ruine and eternal perdition: Therefore GOD to reſtore its primitive beauty, yea to raiſe it to a perfection higher than that of its firſt original, reconciled all things by His CHRIST, both Terreſtrial and Celeſtial. He took away the wars, the hatreds, and the averſions that divided them; and reduced them all into that union which they ought to have, for His glory, and their own good. As to things on earth, you know what was the enmity, and the ſeparatedneſs of the Jews and Gentiles, whom the Law, as a partition wall, did bar off from the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the people of GOD. CHRIST laid this entercloſe even with the ground, and recalling the Gentiles, aſſociated and rea-allyed them with the Jews, to make them thenceforth one only and the ſame people. He did as much to the diſtinctions that ſeparated, the more Polite Nations, from the Barbarous; the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, from the Greeks; the Eaſt, from the Weſt: the North, from the South. He removed all theſe marks and differences, and united all Nations, Sects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions into one only people, into one only body, namely His Church. It's thus, that things on earth were reconciled. As for <hi>things in heaven,</hi> it was the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Father, to reconcile them alſo by His Son. For the Angels, the true Citizens of heaven, were our foes, after ſin; whereas they are henceforth our Friends, and our Allies, united with us under JESUS CHRIST, our common Head. Aforetime they were armed againſt us with flaming ſword; now they fight for us, and encamp about us. They did drive us off, from the entrance into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe: Now themſelves do bear our ſouls thither, at their departure out of this life. They take part in our intereſts, they are ſad at our diſaſters, and rejoyce at our amendment. And to teſtifie how delightful this Reconciliation is to them, they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the birth of our Lord, who came to make it, with their ſongs and melodies. For it they glorified GOD, and bleſſed and congratulated men. But as the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of our ſin communicated it ſelf to all the parts of the Univerſe, even thoſe that are without life, putting them all in diſorder, and ſubjecting them unto vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo I account, that this bleſſed Reconciliation muſt be extended even to them alſo. The will of GOD was to comprehend them alſo in it, re-uniting the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens with our earth, and all the Elements with us. For heaven, which had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Lightnings and Thunder for us, and that would rather have been reduc'd to nothing, than receive us into its courts, is now liberal towards us of its comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able light, and openeth to us the moſt ſecret Sanctuaries of its glory. Life is at accord with us, Immortality is in good intelligence with our fleſh, the Grave is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50919:50"/>no longer our enemy, the Elements ſhall be ſerviceable to our welfare: they ſhall work no more againſt us. And ſo you ſee, how the will of GOD was, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile things on earth, and things in heaven by His Son; and reduce all the parts of the Univerſe unto good terms, each with other. This great work is begun, the foundations of it are laid, the pledges of it are given us. But it will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accompliſhed until the latter day; when the world, freed from the bondage under which it yet groaneth, ſhall appear entirely changed; its new heavens, and its new earth, and its new elements, with the Angels, and the Saints, and all its other parts, conſpiring together in an eternal concord, and an inviolable correſpondence, to the glory of their common Creator, who ſhall then be <hi>all in all,</hi>

                           </gap>.</note> as the Apoſtle elſewhere ſaith. And it's this, in my opinion, which he meaneth in this place, when he ſaith, <hi>That the Father would reconcile all things in Himſelf</hi> (as the Original preciſely runneth.) For theſe words ſignifie, not the term, but the end and event of this Reconciliation; that is to ſay, that it ſhall be made, not with GOD (as the greater part of Expoſitors have underſtood it) but for the glory of GOD. For it is plain, that heavenly things were not reconciled with GOD; for they never were at odds with Him. But it is no leſs evident, that their Reconciliation with us, in the ſenſe we have explained it, will redound to the glory of GOD, when this whole Univerſe ſhall return entirely to its true and due union. It's this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle intendeth, when he ſaith, <hi>That it is the good pleaſure of the Father to reconcile all things in Himſelf;</hi> that is, for Himſelf.</p>
                     <p>It remains now, that we ſpeak of the means which GOD made uſe of, to bring this great work of the Reconciliation of the world to its end. <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſhews it us, when he addeth, <hi>Having made peace by the blood of the croſs of CHRIST.</hi> The war that man had with GOD, in conſequence of his ſin, was (as we ſaid afore) the true and only cauſe of the bad intelligence we were in with the Angels, and the other parts of the World. Whence it is clear, that to make the latter ceaſe, there needed only an extinguiſhing of the former: that is, to reconcile us with the Creatures, there needed only a recovering us to the favour of the Creator. This is the means that the Father, in His Soveraign Wiſdom, made uſe of. And it's this the Apoſtle meaneth, when he ſaith, <hi>That He made peace;</hi> that is, ours, having pacified His own Juſtice, and quenched all the burning of His wrath againſt us. 'Tis by the Sacrifice that JESUS CHRIST, offer'd on His Croſs, that this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous change was wrought. This precious blood contented the Juſtice of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the odour of this Divine Burnt-offering ſweetned His Spirit, and of ſevere and inexorable as He was, rendred Him propitious and favourable to us. Inſtead of fulminating His avenges, He tenders us the arms of His love; and no man is ſo wretched, but He is ready to receive him, provided he accept the promiſe of His mercy with an humble faith. It is not long ſince, that upon one of the Texts foregoing, we treated of the reality, the worthineſs and neceſſity of this Satisfaction, by which the Lord JESUS made our peace with the Father, through the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of his blood on the Croſs, and the voluntary ſuffering there for us, and in our room, the curſe which our ſins deſerved. Therefore we will diſpenſe with our ſelves, for ſpeaking more of it at this time; and to conclude the Exerciſe, will content our ſelves with the noting briefly, upon each of the three Points explained, the principal heads of Conſolation and Edification which they contain.</p>
                     <p>And here, dear Brethren, which ſhall we moſt admire? the goodneſs of the Father, and the will He had to raiſe us up from our fall, and to reconcile us with the whole Creation, whoſe hatred and averſion we had incurred; or His unſpeakable wiſdom, in the ordering of this great work, and in the means he elected and imploy'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it; or the love of the Son, who for our welfare, ſpared not his own blood? Sinner, approach the Throne of GOD with boldneſs. He is no longer environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with flames, and Lightning flaſhes. He is full of grace and clemency. Fear not His indignation or His ſeverity, Peace is made. Your Rebellions are expiated. your ſins are purged. GOD requires nothing of you but Faith and Repentance, His Juſtice is contented; and doubt not, but the ſatisfaction it hath received is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50919:51"/>He that made it for you, is the Well-beloved of the Father, the Lord of glory, in whom all fulneſs dwelleth. You will find abundantly in Him all the good things that are neceſſary for your felicity; the light of wiſdom, to diſſipate your darkneſs, and illuminate your underſtandings, unto a perfect knowledge of Divine things, a righteouſneſs moſt compleat, and of proof every way, to juſtifie and exempt you from the Curſe of the Law, and to open the entrance of the Tribunal of GOD to you: A moſt efficacious Sanctification, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the luſts of your fleſh, and fill you with Charity, Honeſty and Purity: And a moſt plentiful Redemption, to deliver you from death, and from all the evils that have connexion with it, and put you in Eternal poſſeſſion of Immortality. Make your advantage of this Divine Well of Life. Give no ear to them that call you any otherwhere. You are happy enough, if you poſſeſs the LORD JESUS. He is the only Prince of Salvation, the Way, the Truth, and the Life. And as for Creatures, whether Earthly or Heavenly, fear them not. If you are JESUS CHRIST's they ſhall do you no evil. He hath reconcil'd them all to you. He hath taken out of them, all the will, and all the power they had to hurt you. They deſire your good, and ſecretly favour you, owning you for their Friends and Allies. Heaven looks down on you in peace, and calleth you up into its holy place. The Angels bleſs you, and direct all your ways. This Earth will hold you no longer, than your common LORD ſhall judge expedient, for His own glory, and your ſalvation. But if this general peace which you have now with GOD and the World do rejoyce you, the means by which it was procured, ſhould no leſs raviſh you; even that blood of CHRIST ſhed out upon a Croſs, the grand Miracle of GOD, the price of your Liberty, the Salvation and the Glory of the Univerſe. What, and how ardent was that love, which gave ſo rich, and ſo admirable a Ranſom for you? What will He deny you, who hath not kept back His own blood from you? who to make you happy, abhorred not a Croſs, the moſt infamous of all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? who to raiſe you up to the moſt eminent Contentments, underwent the extremeſt Dolours? the loweſt diſgrace, to bring you unto higheſt glory? the Malidiction of GOD, to communicate to you His Benediction? O over-happy Chriſtians, if you could diſcern your bliſſes! Where is the anguiſh of Spirit, or the trouble of Conſcience, or the loſs, or the ſuffering, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, which the meditation of this love ſhould not conſolate? Who ſhall condemn us, ſince the Son of GOD dyed to merit our Abſolution? Who ſhall accuſe us, ſince His Blood, and His Croſs defend us? Who ſhall take from us the Benevolence of the Father, ſince He hath obtain'd it for us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it towards us? Who ſhall pluck out of our hands a life, He hath given us? a Salvation, that He hath ſo dearly bought? But, dear Brethren, theſe conſiderations, which open to us ſo rich a Source of Conſolation, oblige us alſo to a ſingular Sanctification. For how great will be the hardneſs of our hearts, if theſe great evidences, which GOD hath given us of His love, do not affect us? if they kindle not in us an ardent affection towards a GOD, who hath ſo loved us? a ſacred and inviolable reſpect towards a Redeemer, who hath done ſo much for us? He hath reconciled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united all things in Him, both Terreſtrial and Celeſtial. Let us live then henceforth in ſuch ſort, as may anſwer this happy alliance. Let us no more afflict heaven, no more ſcandalize the earth, by the impurity of our deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Let us labour, in conjunction with all the Creatures, for the ſervice, and to glory of our common LORD. Imitate we the purity, the zeal, and the obſequiouſneſs of thoſe Celeſtial Spirits, into whoſe Society we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, by the benefit of this Reconciliation. Let us be cloathed, as they are, with a beautiful and pleaſing light. Our lot is, to be one day like them, in Immortality; let us be ſo, for the preſent in Sanctity. Our peace is made with GOD. Let us not make war upon Him any more. He hath pardoned
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50919:51"/>us all the exorbitancies and rage of our Rebellion; never turn we to any of them again. He will be our good LORD, and gracious Maſter. Be we His faithful Subjects, and obedient Servants. Let the Blood of CHRIST wipe away both our guilt, and our filth. Faſten we our old man to His Croſs; Let the nails that there pierced His fleſh, pierce alſo the members of ours. Let the Croſs that made Him dye, make to dye all our luſts; and extinguiſh by little and little in us, that earthly, carnal and vicious life, which we derive from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> to regenerate and raiſe us up again with the ſecond, unto a new, an holy, and ſpiritual life, worthy of that Blood, by which he He hath purchas'd it for us, and of that Spirit, by whom He hath communicated the beginnings of it to us, and of that Sanctuary of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, where He will fully finiſh it one day, to His own glory, and our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bleſſedneſs. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>DEar Brethren, It was long ſince obſerved by Philoſophers, and we ſtill find it by experience, that general things do move the ſpirits of men very little. The cauſe is, that being naturally glewed up too cloſe, every one to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſts, they mind only that, which toucheth the ſame, and are not ſollicitous about a common concern, till they are made ſome way ſmartly ſenſible, that themſelves have part in it. The miniſters of the Church therefore, ſhould not content themſelves, with propoſing the maxims of heavenly doctrine, in groſs, and in general only, to the ſouls, whoſe edification is committed to them; that they may get hold of them, and produce ſome good effect upon them, they muſt apply to them in particular, each of thoſe Divine verities. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe example ſhould ſerve for a rule, to all the true ſervants of GOD, takes this courſe in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of His Epiſtles; and particularly, in the Text, we have now read you. For having before repreſented to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> the reconciliation of things on earth, and things in heaven, by means of the peace, which was made through the blood of CHRIST, according to the good pleaſure of the Father; he now deſcendeth from general things to particular caſes, and to excite, in the hearts of theſe faithful perſons, a more lively feeling of this grace of GOD, he puts them by name, in mind of the part they had in it; foraſmuch as the efficacy of this goodneſs of His, had been diſplayed upon them, and drawn them out from perdition, and advanced them to higheſt happineſs. <hi>And you,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who were ſomtime eſtranged from him, and who were His enemies in your underſtanding, in wicked works. Yet now hath He reconciled, in the body of His fleſh, by death, to render you holy, and without ſpot, and unreproveable before Him.</hi> In theſe words (as you ſee) to heighten the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the benefit GOD had done them, he firſt ſets before their eyes, the miſerable eſtate, they were naturally in, before the Goſpel was preached unto them. <hi>You were</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſomtime eſtranged from GOD, and His enemies in your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, in wicked works.</hi> Next, he ſets forth the favour, GOD had ſhewed them in the ſequel, notwithſtanding all their unworthineſs. And <hi>yet now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he hath reconciled you, in the body of His fleſh, by death.</hi> Finally, to ſway them unto the purſuance of an exquiſit ſanctification, he repreſents unto them, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or end of their reconciliation with GOD. <hi>To render you holy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and without ſpot, and unreproveable before Him.</hi> Theſe are the three points, we will handle, (GOD willing) in this action, diſtinctly, one after the other. The firſt,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50919:52"/>and natural eſtate of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> before grace. Their reconciliation with GOD, made in the body of the fleſh of CHRIST, by His death; And the end of this reconciliation, to be holy, and unreproveable before Him.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, ſince the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> corrupted, and infected our nature, there are no men born into the world; but their condition of it ſelf is moſt wretched. Yet their miſery is no where ſo clearly diſcovered, as in the Heathen, who are born and live, without the Covenant of GOD. For as to thoſe, whom He preventeth with His grace, breeding them up in His Church from the beginning of their life, His light, and His goodneſs encompaſſing them from their nativity, do hinder the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſo fully in them, the horrid corruption of our nature. Whereas Heathens, having no other guide, but that nature; in them, its ſtate, and ſtrength is to be manifeſtly ſeen. The <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, were of this rank; Gentiles by extraction, by religion, and in manners, before JESUS CHRIST enlightned them. Let us behold in them, an image of the condition, which we ſhould be in, if GOD had not ſeparated us from the reſt of men, and timely drawn us out of our original miſery. The Apoſtle ſaith, firſt, that <hi>ſomtime,</hi> that is, before their converſion, they were <hi>eſtranged,</hi> alienated; namely, eſtranged from GOD, from His covenant, and from His people; as he explaineth it more largely elſewhere. <hi>Remember,</hi> (ſaith he to the <hi>Epheſians</hi>) <hi>that at that time,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> 
                        <hi>ye were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out CHRIST, having no communion with the common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>being ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the covenants of promiſe, having no hope; and being without GOD in the world.</hi> They had no communion with the true GOD; were ſo far from adoring Him, that they not ſo much as thought on Him; and did deride the only nation in the world, that knew Him, and ſerved Him. This is clear, by the Books of the ancient Heathens, that have remained to our time; as alſo by the ignorance, and idolatry of the modern. But the Apoſtle goes further yet, and adds, that at that time, <hi>they were enemies of GOD;</hi> which comprehends two things; the one, that they hated GOD, and warred againſt Him: the other, that GOD accounted them, and purſued them, as His enemies. For the firſt; St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks it expreſly of the Heathen, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> where among other characters He giveth them, He ſets down this for one; <hi>they are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>full of envy, murder, debate,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1.29, 30.</note> 
                        <hi>deceit, malignity, whiſperers, back-biters, haters of GOD:</hi> upon which a queſtion ariſeth; how it is true, that the heathen hated GOD? For either they knew Him, or they knew Him not. If they knew Him not, how did they hate Him, ſince love, and hatred are two paſſions, which cannot be exerciſed, but towards objects known, it being no more poſſible to hate, than it is to love, what we know not? And if they knew Him; ſeeing He is the cheif good, how is it poſſible they ſhould hate Him; ſince our will is not capable of hating good known? To this I anſwer firſt, that when the Scripture ſays, the Heathen hated GOD, it meaneth not, that GOD was the proper, and formal object of their hatred. For it is certain, that in this ſenſe, the Deity can neither be hated by them, that are ignorant of it; nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by thoſe that know it. But the Holy GHOST thus ſpeaketh, for that theſe wretches do altogether, as if they hated GOD; It's a manner of ſpeaking, familiar enough; to ſay the cauſe, for ſignifying the effect; and the antecedent, for expreſſing of the conſequent. Now theſe people, in their blindneſs, defaced the glory of GOD the moſt they could. They battered down the moſt illuſtrious marks of His GOD-head; They blaſphemed His Providence; They reviled His nature. They robbed Him of the honour of creating, and conſerving the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and gave it to monſters. They deſpiſed His Will, and contraried all His or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They paſſionately loved, what He moſt abhorred; and abhorred, what He is beſt pleaſed with. Are not theſe ordinary, and natural effects of hatred? It's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with much reaſon, that the Scripture, to ſet forth this impiety, and fury of the Heathens, ſaith <hi>that they hated GOD:</hi> ſince they treated Him, in the very ſame manner, as if they had directly hated Him. As when the Wiſe man ſaith ſomwhere,
<note place="margin">Pov. 29.24. &amp; 8.36.</note> that <hi>the wicked hate their own ſoul, or their own life;</hi> it is not to ſignifie, that their will hath properly in it, any averſion for their own life; (on the contrary, they but too much love it) But to declare, that they carry themſelves, juſt as if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly hated it, affecting, and practiſing with an extream vehemency, the things that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50919:53"/>cauſe their ruine; and neglecting, and abhorring thoſe, that would lead them to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Secondly, I ſay, That though the Heathen have ſome knowledge of GOD, yet becauſe they phancy Him quite another, then in effect He is, they may be ſaid, in propriety of ſpeech, <hi>to hate Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> For though it be not poſſible for us to hate good, ſo far as it is good; nevertheleſs it often happens, that error repreſenting things to us, quite otherwiſe, than they are in themſelves, we love, what is indeed worthy of hatred; and we hate, what is in truth, moſt worthy to be loved. From ſuch an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, did the Pagans hatred of GOD ariſe. For imagining Him as a Tyrant, full of cruelty, and injuſtice; or as an idle King, that hath no care of His State; it need not be wondered at, if their underſtanding falſly conceiving Him, under ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous a likeneſs, their will was ſwayed to hate Him, rather than love Him. And thoſe among them, that had a better opinion of Him, yet for all that loved Him not. For by an extream errour of mind, placing their ſupream happineſs in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of pleaſures, and vices; and being not ignorant, that GOD hateth them, and puniſheth them; they conſidered Him as an enemy to their contentment. So the love of vice induced them to hate Him. Whence it followed, that GOD on His ſide, as being ſoverainly good, and juſt, condemned their impiety, and had a will to puniſh it; which is the thing, that the Scripture figuratively calls, GOD's hatred. This is that the Apoſtle meaneth, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> in their Paganiſm were <hi>enemies of GOD.</hi> But to ſhew us, how deeply this enmity was rooted in them, having ſaid, that they were enemies, he addeth, <hi>in their underſtanding.</hi> This is the principal, and higheſt faculty of our ſoul, that moveth, and guideth our wills, and our affections, and is by conſequent, the regent of our whole life. The Apoſtle ſaith therefore that rebellion, and enmity againſt GOD, have taken up their ſeat, in the underſtanding; ſeizing (if we may ſo ſay) on this grand Tower of our nature, and thence continually making war againſt GOD. This war, the Apoſtle intends, when he adjoyneth, <hi>in wicked works.</hi> I ſhould never have done, if I would attempt now to repreſent all the horridneſs of the heathens lives. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth us an Epitome of it, in the firſt chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> he there lays forth the principal fruits of their impiety, their injuſtice, their uncleanneſs, and their abominations; vice being grown to ſuch an height among them, that they did not only commit it; but alſo favour it, and took no ſhame to adore the very perſons, whom they confeſſed to have been extreamly commaculated with it. This diſſoluteneſs, and being given up to wicked works, was a clear conviction of their enmity againſt GOD, which renders them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inexcuſable;
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.32.</note> becauſe how great, and univerſal ſoever their corruption was, yet they were not ignorant, that they that do ſuch things are worthy of <hi>Death,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith there, a little after.</p>
                     <p>This doctrine of his, touching the eſtate of Heathens, deſerves great conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it teacheth us two points, of very much importance; Firſt, the quality, and Secondly, the extent of the corruption of our nature by ſin. As for its quality, you ſee it is, ſo horrible, that it ſets us far from GOD, and makes us ſtrangers to Him, and His enemies: ſo deep, that it hath ſoaked into all the faculties of our ſouls, even the underſtanding it ſelf, the nobleſt of them all; and finally, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, that it infecteth all our works with its venome; none iſſuing forth, but wicked ones. Whence appears, firſt how falſe, and pernicious, the imagination of thoſe is, who place this corruption in the lower part of the ſoul only, in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſenſual appetites, and in their reſiſtance of reaſon; and will have it, that the underſtanding hath remained in its integrity. St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth loudly pronounce the contrary, lodging enmity, and rebellion againſt GOD, in the heathens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: and he elſewhere teſtifies the ſame truth in divers places; as when he ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
                        <hi>that the natural man comprehendeth not the things of the Spirit of GOD; that they are fooliſhneſs unto him, and he cannot comprehend them:</hi> and otherwhere, <hi>that the ſenſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.7. Epheſ. 4.18.</note> 
                        <hi>or wiſdom of the fleſh, is enmity againſt GOD; that it yields it ſelf not ſubject to the Law, nor indeed can.</hi> And in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles have their underſtanding darkned.</hi> Confeſs we then, that this evil is univerſal; that it hath depraved our whole nature, and left nothing ſound, or whole in us, from the ſole of the foot, to the crown of the head. It hath extinguiſhed the light
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50919:53"/>of the underſtanding, and filled it with thickeſt darkneſs. It hath made irregular the motions of the will, and put a dreadful diſorder into all the paſſions, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And ſo palpable is this, that the two Maſters of Pagan Philoſophy have in ſome ſort perceived it, and as it were felt it, while they were groping in their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: they have left in writing; the one of them,

From the ſame ground you may ſee again, how vain the conceit of thoſe is, that aſcribe, I know not what merits of congruity (as they call them) to men, out of the ſtate of grace.

But ſince it is quite contrary, and every body well knoweth, that ſuch carriage is a plain provoking of juſtice, and doth inforce puniſhment; who ſeeth not, that man, while he is in the corruption of his nature, doth merit nothing, either by way of <hi>condignity,</hi> or of <hi>congruity;</hi> but the curſe of GOD, according to what the Apoſtle elſewhere ſaith, even that <hi>by nature we are children of wrath?</hi>

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs you ſee, the Apoſtle involves them here in this univerſal miſery. Whence appears, how much ſome of the ancienteſt writers of Chriſtianity were miſtaken, whom the love of learning, and ſecular erudition, did ſo charm,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Clem. Alexand. Strom.</hi> 6.</note> as they ſtuck not to ſay, that the Gentils, by means of their Philoſophy, might become acceptable to GOD, and attain ſalvation. I grant, they had a very quick underſtanding, as we ſee by their Books, in which they have left us admirable marks of the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their minds; Neither do I deny, but GOD preſented them, both in the nature of this vaſt univerſe, and in its government, with very clear, and moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious arguments of His power, wiſdom, goodneſs, and providence; as St.
<note place="margin">Act. 14. Rom. 1.19, 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere ſaith, <hi>that this ſupream LORD never left Himſelf without witneſs;</hi> and that He hath made manifeſt in His works, what may be known of Him. But all this light doth only ſhew us the greatneſs of their corruption. For they, with all the vivacity of their ſpirits, made no proficiency in the School of Providence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fearing of GOD, and ſerving Him: but became vain in their reaſonings, and miſerably abuſed the gifts of Heaven; ſo as the whole ſucceſs of this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, was nought elſe on their part; but that they were thereby rendred inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Conclude we then, that all men generally, not one excepted, are of their own nature ſuch, as the Apoſtle here deſcribes the <hi>Coloſſians, ſtrangers, and enemies to GOD, in their underſtanding in wicked works.</hi> There is nothing, but the word of the LORD alone, which is able to bring them out of this eſtate; by the ſaving grace of His Spirit, wherewith GOD accompanies it. And this the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth here to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> in the ſecond place. For having minded them of their former condition, he addeth, <hi>Yet now hath GOD reconciled you, by the body of His fleſh,</hi> that is, the fleſh of JESUS CHRIST, by His death.</p>
                     <p>The condition, they were in before, was very miſerable. For what can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined more wretched, than men far from, and ſtrangers to GOD, in whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion alone, all their welfare conſiſteth? men, enemies to Him, without whoſe love, they can have no true good? yet beſides miſery, there was horrour alſo in their caſe. Miſery doth ordinarily ſtir up pity: their's was worthy of abhorring, and hatred. For what is there in the world, that leſs deſerves the compaſſion of GOD, and men; or is more worthy of the execration of Heaven, and Earth, than a Subject that withdraweth from His Soveraign? that hates Him, and Warrs againſt Him? that inſolently violates all His Laws, and abandons himſelf to all the crimes, He hath forbidden? eſpecially, if the Soveraign be gracious, and beneficent, as the LORD is, the only Author of all the being, life, and motion, that we have?
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50919:54"/>Nevertheleſs, Oh ineſtimable, and incomprehenſible goodneſs! GOD, for all this, forbore not to have pity on the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> He ſought to them, when they were ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from Him; He offered them peace, when they made War upon Him; He took them for His friends, and choſe them for His Children, when they ſhewed Him, the greateſt hatred, and enmity. Their wicked works deſerved His curſe; and He beſtowed on them, His grace. Their rebellion deſerved His direful flaſhes, and He ſent them His comfortable light. This oppoſition the Apoſtle indicateth here, when he ſaith, <hi>And yet you hath God reconciled.</hi> A like oppoſition, he expreſſeth elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.8.</note> in the ſame matter, ſaying, <hi>GOD altogether commendeth His love to us-ward, in that while we were but ſinners, CHRIST dyed for us.</hi> For the ſetting forth, of this great grace of GOD, towards theſe faithful people, he ſaith, <hi>that GOD hath reconciled them.</hi> Having ſpoken of their eſtrangement, and of their enmity with GOD, He doth with good reaſon, make uſe of the word, <hi>Reconcile,</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ſetting of them again, in His good liking, and favour. It happens ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in the miſunderſtandings of men, that the averſeneſs, and hatred is, but on one ſide; one of the parties ſeeking the favour of the other. Here, as we have yerſt intimated, the averſion was mutual. For we hated GOD, and He becauſe of our ſins, hated us. It was neceſſary therefore, for the reſtoring of us, that both the one, and the other of theſe two paſſions ſhould be remedied: that is, that the wrath of GOD againſt us, ſhould be appeaſed, and our hatred, and enmity againſt Him, extinguiſhed. The word, <hi>Reconcile,</hi> doth of its ſelf, comprehend both the one, and the other: But in the Apoſtle's writings, it referreth principally to the firſt, that is, the mitigation, and appeaſing of the wrath of GOD. As indeed this is the principal point of our reconciliation. For GOD being our ſoveraign LORD, it would not benefit us at all, to change our will towards Him, if His did not operate otherwiſe towards us: as the repentance, and tears of a ſubject are vain, if his Prince reject them, and remain ſtill angry with Him. Furthermore, the word <hi>Reconcile,</hi> as alſo the moſt part of other words of like form, and nature, is taken, two manner of ways. For either it ſignifies ſimply the action, that hath ſuch vertue as is neceſſary to make reconciliation; or it compriſeth the effect of it alſo. It's in the firſt ſenſe that the Apoſtle uſed it afore, where he ſaid, <hi>that GOD hath reconciled all things, celeſtial and terreſtrial, in Himſelf, or for Himſelf, having made peace, by the blood of the croſs of CHRIST.</hi> For he meaneth ſimply, that GOD hath taken away the cauſes of hatred, and enmity, and opened the way of reconciliation; not that all things are already actually reconciled. It's thus again, that we muſt take,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> what he ſaith elſewhere, <hi>that GOD was in CHRIST, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world unto Himſelf, not imputing unto them their treſpaſſes.</hi> But the Apoſtle takes the word, <hi>Reconcile,</hi> in the ſecond ſenſe, when he ſaith, <hi>that we have obtained reconciliation by CHRIST;</hi> and when he <hi>beſeecheth us to be reconciled to GOD:</hi> it being evident, that in theſe places, he intendeth not the right, and power only; but the very effect, and actual having of reconciliation. It's after this ſecond way, that we muſt take the word, <hi>reconcile,</hi> in the Text. For again, this Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation may be conſidered two ways; firſt, in general, as made by JESUS CHRIST on the Croſs; and ſecondly, in particular, as applyed to each of us by Faith. In the firſt conſideration, it is preſented to all men, as ſufficient for their ſalvation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that doctrine of the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Tit. 2.11. 1 Joh. 2.2.</note> 
                        <hi>that the Grace of GOD is ſaving to all men:</hi> and that alſo of St. <hi>John, that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only; but for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> Under the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, it appertaineth only to the faithful, according to that clauſe of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which declareth, <hi>That the only Son was given to the world, that whoſoever believeth in Him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhould have eternal life.</hi> It's preciſely in this ſenſe, the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>that GOD had reconciled the Coloſſians:</hi> he meaneth not ſimply, that GOD had given them, through the croſs of His Son, that they might be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Him by believing; but alſo, that He had effectively reconciled them to Himſelf, and put them in real poſſeſſion of the benefits, that were purchaſed for us by the merit of CHRIST; embracing them as His children, pardoning them all their ſins, and obliviating all His wrath, and the averſion, their offences had given Him, towards them. But the Apoſtle mentions to them, yet again here,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50919:54"/>the means, by which this reconciliation was effected; as being a thing of infinite importance, both to the glory of GOD, and their edification. <hi>He hath reconciled you,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the body of His fleſh,</hi> (that is to ſay, of the fleſh of His CHRIST) <hi>by His death.</hi> There is no one of theſe words, but is of very great weight. Firſt, mentioning here, <hi>the body of our LORD,</hi> he intimateth to us, the myſterie of His Incarnation. As if he had ſaid, that GOD loved us to ſuch a degree, as He would have His own Son become man, to re-unite, and reconcile us with Himſelf. He would have this Divine perſon, whoſe eſſence is ſpiritual, and infinite, aſſume a viſible, and finite body. He ſhews us alſo, by this word, the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by which the wrath of GOD was appeaſed, and our crimes expiated. For it is properly for this, that the Son of GOD had a body, as the Apoſtle teacheth us, when oppoſing this body of the LORD, to ſacrifices of living creatures, that were unprofitable, and incapable of ſatisfying the Juſtice of the Father, he brings Him in ſaying, <hi>Sacrifice, and burnt-offering, thou wouldſt not have;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10.5, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>but a body haſt thou prepared me;</hi> and adjoyneth, that it is, <hi>by the once offering up of this body, we have been ſanctified.</hi> But the Apoſtle doth not ſay ſimply, <hi>the body of CHRIST:</hi> he addeth, <hi>the body of His fleſh,</hi> that is, according to the ſtile of the <hi>Hebrews, His fleſhy body; His body of fleſh.</hi> At firſt bluſh, you may ſeem, that this addition is needleſs, and to no purpoſe. But it's much otherwiſe. For in the language of Scripture, every Body is not fleſh. It gives this name only to an infirm, a paſſible, and mortal body. He means therefore, that the LORD, to reconcile us, not only aſſumed a body; which yet is very marvelous; but that He took a feeble, and mortal body; a body ſuſtaining it ſelf by meat, and drink; a body like ours, and ſubject to all their meanneſſes, and infirmities. A conſideration, that as you ſee, exceedingly heightens, both the excellency of His love towards us, and the value of the means, by which He reconciled us; it ſo being, that the King of glory, who is the Author and Mediator of this work, veſted Himſelf with poor Fleſh, to compaſs His deſign. And this is the reaſon, why the ſacred writers ſo often uſe this word, to ſignifie our LORD's humane nature; as when they ſay,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. Joh. 2. Heb. 2.14.</note> 
                        <hi>that GOD was manifeſted in the fleſh; that the word was made fleſh; that the Son did partake of fleſh and blood.</hi> Indeed, this qualification of the body of CHRIST, was neceſſary for the expiating of our ſins, ſince this could not be effected, but by ſufferings, of which, only a fleſhy body is capable. Whence it comes, that in the ſixth Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> where Himſelf ſpeaketh of the vertue He hath to quicken us, He alſo uſeth theſe very words, ſaying, <hi>that His fleſh is meat indeed, and His blood drink indeed;</hi> and <hi>that He will give His fleſh for the life of the world.</hi> This word is the cauſe, that I underſtand this paſſage of the natural body of CHRIST, and not of His myſtical body, to which, it ſeems, ſome do refer it. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the LORD receiveth, into the union of His myſtical body, (that is, of His Church) all thoſe, that applying to themſelves the promiſes of His Goſpel, by <hi>Faith,</hi> are effectually reconciled to GOD. Yet this is not the body, the Apoſtle meaneth here; ſince the body, he ſpeaks of, is the body of the Fleſh of the LORD; which cannot be affirmed of His myſtical body. His ſaying therefore, that <hi>GOD hath reconciled us, in His body,</hi> muſt be taken, as if he had ſaid, <hi>by His body.</hi> For as we have often informed you, 'tis ordinary in the ſtile of Scripture, to put <hi>in,</hi> for <hi>by.</hi> And hence appears, how extravagant the imagination of ſome ancient hereticks was, who did dogmatize, that JESUS CHRIST had but a vain, and falſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a body, and not a real, ſolid, and true body, as alſo the errour of thoſe, who confeſſed He had a true body, but held it to be celeſtial, and of a quite other matter, and ſubſtance, than ours are. The Apoſtle confounds theſe fooliſh phancies, by terming the body of our LORD, <hi>the body of His fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, having ſaid, <hi>that we were reconciled by the body of His Fleſh,</hi> the Apoſtle addeth, in the laſt place, <hi>by His death.</hi> It was not enough, oh faithful brethren, that the King of glory, the Prince of life, aſſumed to Himſelf a body, and even a body of fleſh, vile, and infirm, as yours. To reconcile you unto GOD, it was neceſſary He ſhould dye. His fleſh would have profited you nothing, if it had not ſuffered that death, which you deſerved. But of this death of the LORD, and of its neceſſity, and of its efficacy, we have ſpoken largely, upon the Texts fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50919:55"/>Here, we will only remark two things, before we go further. The firſt is, that CHRIST did ſatisfie the Juſtice of His Father for us, ſince it is by His death, that He reconciled us; For except this be aſſerted, it is evident, His death will have contributed nothing to our reconciliation: in reſpect of that, he would have dyed for nought. Grant, that there was need He ſhould dye, for the confirming of His doctrine, and to give us an example of patience; though to ſay true, this reaſon, if there were no other, ſeemeth not ſo neceſſary, that it ſhould have obliged the Son of GOD to dye. Yet ſtill, after this account, His death will have contributed nothing, to our reconciliation with the Father. Him, His own mercy alone, and not any conſideration of this death, would have appeaſed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. And nevertheleſs, the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, we were reconciled by that death, which the LORD ſuffered, in the body of His fleſh. Sure then it muſt be acknowledged, that it quenced the wrath of the Father, that is to ſay, ſatisfied His juſtice for us. The other particular, which I would remark here, is, that the body of the LORD made propitiation of our ſins, only as it was infirm fleſh, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death. Every one confeſſeth, that now He dyeth no more; yea, that He is inveſted with a ſoveraign glory, having for ever put off the infirmity, and mortality of the fleſh. Certainly then it is vainly, and without reaſon, that ſome do imagine. His body is offered ſtill to this day, for the reconciling of ſinners unto GOD. <hi>It's by death,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom 6.9.</note> 
                        <hi>that He hath reconciled us,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> And being now <hi>raiſed from the dead, He dyeth no more,</hi> ſaith he elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>But I come to the third, and laſt article of our Text, wherein the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that it is to make us holy, and without ſpot, and unreprovable before Him, that GOD hath reconciled us, by the death of His Son.</hi> It is ſtrictly in the original, <hi>to preſent us,</hi> or <hi>to make us ſtand,</hi> and <hi>appear,</hi> before Him holy, without ſpot, and unrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable; which hath given occaſion to ſome of our Expoſitors to referr theſe words alſo, to our Juſtification before GOD; as if the Apoſtle meant, that He made our peace, and aboliſhed the enmity, to the end that being purified by the vertue of the Sacrifice of His Son, and clothed with His righteouſneſs, by faith, we might appear before the Tribunal of His grace, without condemnation, and without confuſion. But nothing compelleth us to pitch on this: It is much better, in my judgment, to underſtand it of our ſanctification, than of our Juſtification. Firſt, becauſe the words themſelves agree much better with it; the Scripture (as you know) ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily expreſſing, the gift of Regeneration, by the word, Holineſs; whereas it uſeth the word, Juſtifie, or pardon of our ſins, and not imputing them unto us, when it would ſignifie the firſt benefit of GOD, which we obtain, by the imputation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of CHRIST. Secondly, becauſe the Apoſtle having already repreſented it unto us, in thoſe words, <hi>that GOD hath reconciled us, by the body of the fleſh of His Son, by death,</hi> which do ſignifie, that He hath received us into favour, pardoning us all our ſins, as we have explained them; it ſeems needleſs, to repeat the ſame thing again. In fine, becauſe both St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other ſacred writers, are wont, to joyn thoſe two gifts of GOD, our Juſtification, and our Sanctification, together, as two graces, that are inſeparable, and never go, one without the other; ſo as having ſpoken to us of the one, it was not only convenient, but alſo in ſome ſort neceſſary,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30. 1 Cor. 6.11.</note> he ſhould annex the other; juſt as elſewhere, having ſaid, that <hi>CHRIST is made unto us righteouſneſs,</hi> he immediately adds, and <hi>ſanctification;</hi> and again in another place, where having touched the filthineſs of the former life of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> as here that of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>But ye are waſhed; but ye are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi> Here the Apoſtle doth not only knit theſe two graces together: but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſheweth us, the order, and relation which they have, the one to the other; that the ſecond, to wit, <hi>Sanctification,</hi> is the end of the former, that is, of <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He hath reconciled us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the death of His Son, to render us holy, without ſpot, and unrebukable before Him.</hi> The Scripture teacheth us the ſame thing in divers other places; as in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> where <hi>Zachary</hi> ſaith, <hi>that GOD ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us mercy, and delivereth us out of the hand of our enemies, that we might ſerve Him without fear, in holineſs, and righteouſneſs, before Him.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle.
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.74, 75. 1 Pet. 2.24.</note> 
                        <hi>CHRIST,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath born our ſins, in His own body, on the tree, that we being dead to ſin, might live unto righteouſneſs.</hi> And our St. <hi>Paul,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50919:55"/>that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST dyed for all, that they which live,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.15.</note> 
                        <hi>might not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto Him, who dyed, and was raiſed again, for them;</hi> and elſewhere again, <hi>that CHRIST gave Himſelf for us,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> 
                        <hi>that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie us, to be unto Him, a peculiar people, addicted to good works;</hi> and in another paſſage, altogether like that, which we are upon.
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.5.</note> 
                        <hi>He loved the Church,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and gave Himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie it, have cleanſed it, by the waſhing of water, by the word; and might preſent it to Himſelf a glorious Church, having neither ſpot, nor wrinkle, nor other ſuch thing: but that it might be holy, and unreprovable.</hi> I inſiſt upon this point; becauſe it is of exceeding great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Firſt, you ſee by it, what the dignity of Holineſs is. For ſince the end, of neceſſity, is always more excellent, than the means, which are uſed to compaſs it; it is clear, than ſanctification, being the laſt end, of all the things, that the LORD employs for our ſalvation, is the greateſt, and moſt excellent, of all His graces. And ſo you know, St. <hi>Paul</hi> poſitively declares, that Charity (which is for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, no other thing but ſanctity) is more excellent, than either, faith, or hope; and he proves it, becauſe neither the one, nor the other of theſe two vertues ſhall have any place in Heaven, as being but means, and helps, for our conducting thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereas Charity, as the laſt, and higheſt perfection of our being, ſhall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally remain. Secondly, from hence appears, how much carnal Chriſtians do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves; who pretend to ſalvation, without ſanctification. Wretched men, what do you? Your pretention is a vain <hi>Chimera.</hi> You purſue an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. For that ſalvation, which you do deſire, is nothing for the main, but that very holineſs, which you do refuſe. Both that faith, and thoſe other qualities, which, as you ſay, you have, ſerve only to ſanctifie men; Without this they are unprofitable things. Suppoſe then that you have them; if they do not change you; if they do not fill your heart, with love to GOD, and with charity towards your neighbour; in a word, if they render you not, holy, they will advantage you nothing. So far will they be, from giving you immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; that they will aggravate your miſery; and ſink you deeper into the abyſs of death. Never believe, that GOD gave us His own Son, clothed Him with a body of fleſh, delivered Him up to the death of the Croſs, that He reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us by ſuch precious blood, and wrought all theſe grand wonders, which raviſh Heaven, and Earth, that He might acquire us the priviledge to ſin freely; For, far be it from ſo wiſe, and ſo holy a Deity, to be thought to have ever had, ſuch an extravagant, and infamous a deſign. He hath laid forth all the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of grace, and love upon us, that He might reſtore His own image in our nature; that He might aboliſh ſin out of it, and transform us into new creatures, pure, and holy, and in ſome ſort like Himſelf, and His Son, in this reſpect. I confeſs, the deſcription, which the Apoſtle here giveth us, of this grace of GOD in us, is high, and magnifique; and that it ſeems, to ſurmount the reach of believers, while they are in the preſent life. For of which of them, can it be truly ſaid, while he remains in this world, that he is Holy, and without ſpot, and unreprovable before GOD? But to this I anſwer, firſt, that neither doth the Apoſtle affirm, that this great work of the LORD's in us, is compleated in this life; He ſheweth us only what His purpoſe is; and what the end of His grace; and how good, and glorious, that holineſs is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with He will cloath us. For if we be truly His, He will not leave us, till He hath made us ſuch, as the Apoſtle's Text importeth, <hi>even holy, without ſpot, and unreprovable.</hi> Secondly, I ſay, that though the higheſt degree of ſanctification, in this life, be much beneath that, which ſhall adorn us in the next; and that in compariſon of it, the ſame is defective, yet it fails not of being true, and of having all its parts, though in a weak degree. It is ſincere, and without hypocriſie, and ſuch in ſumm, as the words of the Apoſtle, in ſome ſort, agree to. For true believers, while here below, do put off the habitudes of vices, and put on thoſe of Chriſtian vertues; by reaſon whereof, they are juſtly called holy; though, through infirmity, there ſlip from them ſomtimes, ſome actions contrary thereto. They are waſhed, from thoſe foule and ugly ſpots, that yerwhile deformed their
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50919:56"/>whole life; and an adverſary connot note, or reprehend ought in their deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is contrary to the profeſſion they make of the Covenant of grace. As for what the Apoſtle addeth, that they are ſuch, <hi>before GOD,</hi> it is only to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that their piety is true, and real, not feigned, nor diſſembled; that it is not a mask, which cheateth the eyes of men: but a diſpoſition of heart, which GOD diſcerns within them, as men do behold, the evidences of it without, upon them; in the ſame ſenſe, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaid of <hi>Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, that they were both righteous before GOD.</hi> Lo there, Beloved Brethren, what we had to ſay to you, upon this Text.</p>
                     <p>The rigour of the ſeaſon obliging us, to conclude this action; I will only touch at, in a word or two, the uſes we ſhould deduce from it, for our edification; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it to your diligence, to dilate each of them; and above all, to reduce them carefully into practice. Remember, firſt, the miſerable eſtate, wherein you were, before GOD prevented you by His grace; and think, that it is to you alſo, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ye were ſomtime eſtranged, and enemies in your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings in wicked works.</hi> For our anceſters, before the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhone on theſe countries, were in ſuch a condition, as the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> or rather a worſe. Our Fathers were Hittites, and our Mothers Amorites, living in the darkneſs of Paganiſm, ſerving an <hi>Heſus,</hi> and a <hi>Belenus,</hi> and a <hi>Tautates,</hi> and I know not what other vanities; ſacrificing men to them, and weltring in the filth of the moſt infamous vices. Being, by the great benignity of GOD, drawn out of this gulf; we were yet caſt into another; in which, under other names, we committed the like crimes; adoring an inſenſible, and inanimate thing; and bending down our ſelves before wood, and ſtone, and dumb images, and giving to a mortal man, the glorious names, which belong only to the Son of GOD: being corrupted, both in our thoughts, and in our deeds. Theſe faults were ſo much worſe, than the former, by how much leſs ignorant we were of our maſter's will, than we had yerſt been. Admire next, the goodneſs of GOD, who ſeeing us in this abyſs, though our ingratitude, and rebellion merited His heavieſt avenges; yet had pity on us, and viſiting us in His infinite mercies, hath recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled us, by the body of the fleſh of His Son, through His death. He hath ſent to us <hi>Epaphras</hi>'s, as He did to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Miniſters of His word, who have made the voice of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the other Apoſtles to reſound among us. He hath purified us, and waſhed all our filth in the blood of His CHRIST. He hath bedewed our hearts therewith, and aboliſhed the enmity, and extinguiſhed the hatred, and re-united us unto Himſelf; communicating to us the Divine body of His Son, nailed for us to the Croſs, the ſource of our ſalvation, and the treaſury of all the good things of Heaven. His death hath been our life; and His malediction our benediction. Acknowledge we this great goodneſs of our GOD, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found gratitude. Give we Him the glory of all the good that may be in us. If there be any light in our underſtandings, any peace in our conſciences, any pureneſs in our affections, any rectitude in our ways, bleſs we the kindneſs of this Soveraign LORD, who hath vouchſafed to illuminate us, to reconcile us, and to cleanſe us. Without this favourable beaming forth of His grace, we ſhould be yet ſtrangers, and enemies, in the bondage, and darkneſs of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or under the yoke and in the captivity of <hi>Chaldea.</hi> Make we uſe now of the benefits, He hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on us. Let us abide faſtned to Him, ſo as nothing may ſet us at diſtance from Him. Love we Him fervently, and ſerve Him diligently, leſt we become yet again His enemies. Let thoſe underſtandings, which were ſomtime the heads of that wicked war, we made againſt Him, religiouſly maintain that holy, and happy Peace, which He hath vouchſafed to conclude with us. Baniſh we thence all thoughts of rebellion. Have we ſtill before our eyes, that ſacred fleſh, which the King of glory was clothed with, for us; the blood, wherewith He purchaſed our peace; the death He underwent, to bring us in again, with GOD His Father. Let us not prophane a bleſſing, that coſt Him ſo dear. Imitate we alſo His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Treat we our neighbours, as He treated us; If they avoid us, let us ſeek to them. For we alſo were enemies to GOD, and warred againſt Him, when He
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50919:56"/>called us to the communion of His grace. Above all, remember we, that the end of all the miracles, GOD hath done, on our behalf, is to make us holy, without ſpot, and unreprovable before Him. Let not us betray ſo admirable, and ſo reaſonable a deſign. Let us not fruſtrate ſo good, and ſo merciful a LORD, of His intentions. Dear Brethren, I might here make large complaint of the profaneneſs of ſome, of the looſneſs of others, and of the faltrings of us all, who labour after nothing leſs, than that high, and accompliſhed ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to which GOD calleth us: but I had much rather end with entreaties, than with complaints, and do conjure you in the Name of the LORD, and by your own ſalvation, that you would judge your ſelves, and that renouncing all the faults of the time paſt, all the impieties, and luſts of this world, ye would live henceforth ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly; and keep your ſelves holy, pure, and unreprovable, to the glory of GOD, the edification of men, and your own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>OUr LORD JESUS CHRIST, in the Goſpel according to S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> telleth us of two ſorts of people, which hear His Doctrine, and frequent His School; the one, they that put His words in practiſe, that is, thoſe, who embracing the Goſpel with a true and lively faith, do render Him the obedience He demandeth of them; the other, they that hear, but put not in practice what He ſaith unto them, that is, thoſe, who giving but little or no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to His Divine truth, take no care to perform what He commands, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with a vain outſide Profeſſion, and are not inwardly affected and changed, as they ought to be. He compares the former, to a wiſe and prudent man, that hath built his houſe upon a Rock; and when the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, it fell not for all this; for it was founded upon a Rock. But on the contrary, he compares the ſecond ſort, to a fooliſh man, that built upon the ſand; <hi>And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when the rain fell, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and ſmote upon this houſe, it fell, and the fall thereof was great.</hi> Dear Brethren, this is an excellent Parable, and worthy to be deeply engraven on the hearts of the truly faithful. For it ſhews us, firſt, That to have part in the LORD's ſalvation, it is not enough to call Him our Maſter, and make Profeſſion of His Diſcipline. They that have but this, will fall ſooner or later, and be infallibly ruin'd. Secondly, It further teacheth us, That it ſufficeth not to have begun, except a man do preſevere to the end, without ever giving back. And laſtly, It declares to us, what the cauſe is, both of the perſeverance of ſome, and of the revolting and fall of others; thoſe that are founded on the rock, do ſtand firm, and reſiſt the ſcandals, with which the Devil and the world do combate the truth; thoſe that are built only on the ſand, are eaſily born down, even at the firſt aſſaults which the adverſe powers make upon them. This Doctrine S. <hi>Paul</hi> yerſt repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> in the Text, we have now read to you. In the words foregoing, as you heard in its place, he did ſet before their eyes, the wonders of the love of GOD, which had been gloriouſly ſhewed upon them by JESUS CHRIST their Saviour, who had called them to His Communion, and of ſtrangers and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as they were, made them friends of His Father, reconciling them by the body of His fleſh, through His death, to render them holy, without ſpot, and unreprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able before Him. But the Apoſtle knowing, there were Seducers and deceitful workers among them, who laboured to <hi>turn them away from the purity and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpel;</hi> that they might be preſerv'd from thoſe mens poyſons, he now advertiſeth them, that this great ſalvation whereof he had ſpoken, could not be
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50919:57"/>aſſured to them without perſeverance. For qualifying, and in ſome ſort, correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His ſimple and abſolute aſſertion, <hi>That GOD had reconciled them to Himſelf;</hi> he addeth the condition, upon which this Divine grace was promis'd them. <hi>If indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you continue in the faith, being founded and firm,</hi> &amp;c.—This Leſſon, my Brethren, is no leſs neceſſary for us, than it was erewhile, for the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> ſince the floods, the winds and ſtorms, that were then raiſed againſt the Edifice of their faith, do in like manner at this day, beat upon ours; divers deceitful workers, both without and within, endeavouring to overthrow it. Take we therefore this ſacred Preſervative againſt their malice, which the Apoſtle here giveth us; and that we may the better make our profit of it, let us meditate in order, the three particulars which his Inſtruction containeth. For, to confirm the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, he ſheweth them, firſt, The neceſſity, and the manner of it, in thoſe words, <hi>If indeed you continue in the faith, being founded and firm, and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel which you have heard.</hi> Secondly, He ſets before them an excellent Argument, of the truth of that Goſpel which they had heard; to wit, <hi>That it was preached in all the world.</hi> And laſtly, He further alledgeth a ſecond proof of its verity, taken from his own Miniſtry; <hi>of which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have been made a Miniſter.</hi> Theſe are three points we will handle, if it pleaſe GOD, in this action; noting briefly upon each of them, what we ſhall judge moſt proper for our Edification and Conſolation.</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt, the Apoſtle explains himſelf about it in thoſe terms, <hi>If indeed ye continue,</hi> &amp;c.—Where you ſee, he lays down firſt,
<note place="margin">[As Above.]</note> That Faith is the means by which we enter into poſſeſſion, and uſe of the good things of OOD, which He promiſeth us in His Son. The old Covenant had alſo its good things; but the condition, which it required of men, for their obtaining the ſame, was quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. For it demanded of them an exact and perfect obeying of the Law, and upon any failure of an entire accompliſhing of the ſame, threatned a curſe, leaving the ſinner no hope of life at all: according to that dreadful clauſe, <hi>Do theſe things, and thou ſhalt live;</hi> and, <hi>Curſed is every one that doth them not.</hi> But the Goſpel, beſide that the good things which it ſets before us, are much greater, and more Divine than thoſe of the Law, differs moreover from the Law, in this eſpecially, that it demands of men, for their having them, nothing but Faith
<note n="*" place="margin">Only. 1</note> alone; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſentence of our LORD, <hi>GOD ſo loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoſoever believeth in Him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> This the Apoſtle ſheweth us here with much clearneſs; when having ſaid, <hi>That GOD hath reconciled us to Himſelf, by the body of the fleſh of His Son, to render us ſpotleſs and unreproveable;</hi> he addeth, <hi>If indeed ye continue in the faith.</hi> This Connexion of the two parts of his Diſcourſe, doth evidently infer, that it is Faith, which makes us to have part, in the Reconciliation and Peace of GOD, and in the holineſs which is by the Goſpel. So likewiſe you know, that in a multitude of other places, the Scripture informeth us expreſly, that it is by Faith we are juſtified, and have peace with GOD; and that it is by Faith, our hearts are purified. Faith is the means of our union with GOD; it is the root of our Charity, and the Source of our comfort; and in a word, the only cauſe of our felicity. For as a Medicine, how excellent and healthful ſoever it be, does no good, ſave to thoſe that take it. So the LORD's Redemption, and the vertue of His Sacrifice, how great and infinite ſoever, though able to heal all our ſins, and to give us Eternity, yea, not us alone, but to all the men in the world; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, will communicate none of thoſe benefits to us, except we receive it by Faith. It is Faith that applies it to us, and ſheds abroad the efficacy of it, into all the parts of our nature. But becauſe very many deceive themſelves in this matter, and take that for true Faith, which hath but the ſhadow and name of Faith; the Apoſtle telleth us, that to have part in the ſalvation of JESUS CHRIST, our faith muſt be conſtant, and ſuch as we do abide, and perſevere in. For as in Games and Combates for Prizes, none are crowned but they that hold out to the end: So in the heavenly Liſts or Race, GOD glorifieth them only, which run with conſtancy, home to the mark. Thoſe that turn aſide, or ſtop in the midſt of the courſe, loſe their labour; according to that the LORD
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50919:58"/>did declare, <hi>Whoever ſhall perſevere to the end, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle in another place, aſſuring himſelf of the Crown, among other cauſes on which he grounded this aſſurance,

Firſt, all the rebellious and unbelieving, that give no faith to the Promiſes and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the bounty of GOD; as our Saviour ſaid, <hi>He that ſhall not believe, ſhall be condemned;
<note place="margin">Mark 16.16. John 3.36.</note> He that diſobeyeth the Son, ſhall not ſee life: but the wrath of GOD abideth on him.</hi> Secondly, they that believe, but it is for a time only; ſuch as abide not in the faith, but having receiv'd it at the beginning, afterwards quit and reject it. Whether it be, that the ſcorching heat of perſecution doth dry up and conſume the tender bud: or the overflowing irruption of pleaſures, or of worldly affairs, doth carry it away: Whether it be, that the cares of covetouſneſs or ambition do ſuffocate it; or the deceitfulneſs of error, and the hand of falſe Teachers, do pluck it up out of their heart. The Apoſtle therefore requires of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that to the end they might partake of the ſalvation of GOD, they not only have faith, but do perſevere in it. <hi>If indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you continue in the faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet this is not all; he willeth moreover, <hi>That they be founded and firm.</hi> I grant, it ſeldom happens, that this vain and feeble faith, which conſiſts only in a naked profeſſion, and ſome ſlight movings of heart, doth endure to the end in thoſe that have it. Scandal or tentation moſt commonly plucketh off their mask, and openly carrieth them out of the fellowſhip of the Church. Yet it ſeemeth not impoſſible, but they may continue, even to the laſt, in this eſtate. As a little chaff may abide in the floor, if the wind blow not: So there is ſome probability, that theſe ſame perſons, in like manner, may remain mingled with the truly faithful even until death, if perſecution or offence do not faſten on them. But ſuppoſe that this do happen, for all that, they ſhall not be ſaved; becauſe the faith they have, and in which they will have perſiſted, is a nullity; to which GOD hath promis'd nothing; its the ſhadow, and the Idol; not the ſubſtance and reality of faith. Whence it follows, that as chaff, though it remain in the floor, yet is not lock'd up in the Granary with the Wheat, but left out or burned, as an uſeleſs thing. So likewiſe theſe people, that have but this vain faith, ſuppoſe they do abide in GOD's floor, that is, in the external Communion of the Church unto the end; yet ſhall not for all this, enter into His heavenly Garner, that is, His Kingdom; but be excluded thence, and rejected, as having no lot or portion with true Believers. They will think it fair to alledge, that they have lived in the Church of CHRIST, that they have, perhaps, even propheſied and caſt out Devils, and done wonderful works in His Name; the LORD will openly tell them, <hi>I never knew you, Depart from me, ye that make a trade of iniquity.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 7.22.23.</note> The Apoſtle therefore, to ſhew that he ſpeaks of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, not in this vain ſhadow of faith, but in true faith, doth not ſimply ſay, <hi>If ye continue in the faith,</hi> but addeth, <hi>being founded and firm.</hi> If the Hypocrite, or the Temporary, do continue in the Profeſſion, or in the rudiments of Piety; it is not, becauſe they are founded, but becauſe they are not tempted; as a woman that remaineth chaſte, only for not having been ſollicited to evil. They ow their perſeverance to the enemies favourableneſs, and not to their own firmneſs. This falſe conſtancy may deceive a man, who ſeeth but the outſide, and the event of things. But it cannot deceive GOD, who knoweth the inſide of it, and who ſoundeth hearts, and judgeth of things, by what they are; not by what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, or by the events they have. The Apoſtle therefore willeth, that for partaking of His ſalvation, we have true perſeverance; and do continue in the faith, not ſimply, and in any ſort whatever; but through, <hi>being founded in it, and firm.</hi> GOD doth ſave ſuch only. It is but for them, that He hath prepared His Kingdom. The former of theſe two words, here uſed by the Apoſtle, is taken from build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which being founded deep in the earth upon a rock, are firm and ſolid, and of proof againſt time and ſtorms; whereas buildings which have no foundation, or but on ſand, are feeble and unable to reſiſt the ſhock. The LORD made uſe of this ſame compariſon in the Parable we touched, at the beginning; and He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ects on it too in that famous promiſe, which He made S. <hi>Peter,</hi> of building His
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50919:58"/>Church, in ſuch manner, on the ſtone, that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. The other word which the Apoſtle uſeth, hath the ſame meaning, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifies in the Original, a thing in ſuch a ſettlement, as 'tis difficult to move and ſtagger it: A thing that is fixedly ſeated and placed, and neither branleth nor changeth. This is the ſettlement of true Believers, who ſhall have part in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of GOD. Their faith founded on the Eternal Rock, JESUS CHRIST their Lord, ſeated and placed upon this immovable Baſis, abideth firm, and not to be ſhaken. The torrents and the winds do ſhock it in vain; the tempeſts and the floods may beat upon it, they cannot overthrow it.</p>
                     <p>Upon this Doctrine of the Apoſtle, we ſhall raiſe two Obſervations. The firſt is, That the faith of thoſe who perſevere in the ſenſe he intendeth, doth differ from the faith of them, who revolt, not only in the event, for that the one faileth, and the other perſiſteth and abideth: but alſo in the nature of the thing it ſelf. For the one are founded and firm; and the others are not ſo. Who ſees not, that there is a great difference, between a houſe which is well founded, and an houſe which is but built upon the ſand. JESUS CHRIST and His Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declare, that ſuch as ſtand are founded; and that ſuch as fall, are not. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then, the faith of the former is quite different from the faith of the latter; and this different ſucceſs of the one, and the others, in that the one do fall, and the others bear up, doth indeed diſcover to us the difference which is between them, but doth not make it. It is the effect of it, not the cauſe; an argument of it, not the original. The ſame thing appears alſo, from the comparing of the one elſwhere to wheat, and the others to chaff, The wheat is not wheat, becauſe it abideth in the floor: but clean contrary, it abideth in the floor, becauſe it is wheat; and in like manner, the chaff becomes not chaff, becauſe it goeth out of the floor; but on the contrary, it goes out thence, becauſe it was chaff. This diverſity of events, doth evidence the weightineſs and firmneſs of the one; and the levity of the other. Even ſuch is the caſe of true Believers, and ſuch as are but temporary. Perſecution and offence do not make the difference which is ſeen between them, when the former do retain the Goſpel, and the others quit it. This event only ſheweth, that the one were GOD's wheat, and the others but chaff; according to what S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith of Apoſtates, <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John 2.19.</note> 
                        <hi>that it might be made manifeſt, that all are not of us.</hi> The ſame is to be further ſeen evidently in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Sower, where the LORD ſaith expreſly,
<note place="margin">Mat. 13.13, 19, 21.</note> that he that perſevereth had heard the word, and underſtood it, and receiv'd it in an honeſt and good heart. Whereas He ſaith of them who do revolt, that one heard, but underſtood it not; another had no root in himſelf: An evident ſign, that their diſpoſition was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent at firſt, before the perſeverance of the one, and the fall of the others. Whence appears, how impertinent the Argument is, which our Adverſaries draw from the Apoſtacy of the latter, to prove that the faith of the former may fail; and on the contrary. For if the wind carry away the chaff, it doth not therefore follow, that it ſhall alſo bear away the corn; and if the ſtorm beat down an houſe that's planted on two or three ſtakes, it is not to be ſaid, it may do as much to an Houſe that's founded on a rock. If the blade that ſhoots forth, and grows up ſuddenly in the ſand, without any bottom, happen to wither at the firſt extreme heat that ſmites it; this implieth not, that the like may betide the corn which is deeply rooted in a good and fertile ſoil. The other point which we have to obſerve is, the aſſurance of true faith, excellently repreſented here by the Apoſtle in theſe words, which are full of a ſingular Emphaſis, <hi>If you continue in the faith, being founded and firm;</hi> contrary to what is taught in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that faith is in a continual agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſo as a Believer can have no aſſurance, that he is for preſent in the ſtate of Grace, and much leſs yet that he ſhall perſevere in it for the future. In Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, can it be ſaid of theſe people, as the Apoſtle ſaith here of the LORD's true Diſciples, that they are firm and founded? How may it be, ſeeing they inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly float in doubt and uncertainty? and are miſerablely in ſuſpence between the hope of heaven, and the fear of bell? I paſs by that other error of theirs, which is yet more contrary to the Apoſtle's Doctrine, namely, their maintaining that the choiceſt faith may fail. If it be thus, how can it be affirm'd, that thoſe that have it, are founded and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50919:59"/>firm? Let us then hold faſt the truth that's taught us here, and in divers other places of Scripture, to wit, that true faith abideth always; and being founded on the Merit, and the Death, and the Interceſſion of JESUS CHRIST, doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail. The wind makes but the chaff to fly away: it prevails not upon good grain. It overthrows only the trees that are feeble, and ill grounded. It leaveth in their place, thoſe that ſtand upon good and deep grown roots. And as an Ancient ſometime ſaid,
<note place="margin">Tertul. de Paerſc.</note> 
                        <hi>We may not account them prudent or faithful, whom He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie hath been able to change. None is a Chriſtian, but he that perſevereth to the end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I return to the Apoſtle, who for the fuller Explication of this firm, and not to be ſhaken faith which he requireth in us, for the obtaining of ſalvation, addeth further, <hi>And if ye be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel.</hi> Juſtly doth he joyn Hope unto Faith, theſe two virtues being ſo ſtraitly link'd together, that they mutually ſuccour each other, and one cannot be had or loſt without the other. For firſt, Hope is the ſuit of faith, expecting with aſſurance, the fruition of the the things that we believe; ſo as when the perſwaſion that we have of them, comes to totter, it is not poſſible, but the hope which was founded on it, muſt come to ruine. Again, in the combats which we ſuſtain for the faith, hope is one of our principal ſupports: while it is firm and vigorus in us, it repelleth without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, all the ſtrokes of the Enemy, oppoſing to the fear of the evils, wherewith he threatneth us, and to deſire of the good he promiſeth us, the incomparable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the glory and felicity which we look for in the other world. He that hopes for heaven, cannot be tempted by the paintings and appearances of the earth. For this cauſe, the Apoſtle in another place, compares hope to an Anchor, which penetrating within the vail, faſtned and grounded in Heaven, holdeth our veſſel firm and ſteady, amid the waves and agitations of this tempeſtuous Sea, whereon we ſail here below. And it's this, in my opinion, which the Apoſtle aims at here, that the faithful might be eſtabliſhed in the faith, he willeth them, to have ſtill in their hearts, the hope of heavenly bliſs, and never to ſuffer this Sacred and Divine Anchor to be taken from them. They are in ſafety, while it holds them faſt. But for the better expreſſing it, he calleth it peculiarly, <hi>The hope of the Goſpel;</hi> that is, the hope which the Goſpel hath wrought in us: the expectation of thoſe good things which it promiſeth. And ſo, you ſee, he referreth Hope to the Goſpel, as to its true and genuine object. All the hopes that we conceive from other grounds, are vain and failing. There are none but thoſe which embrace the promiſes of JESUS CHRIST, that are firm and ſolid; and ſuch as never confound them that wait for them. The Goſpel promiſeth us, firſt, the entire expiation of our ſins, and the peace of GOD in JESUS CHRIST His Son. They therefore that ſeek this benefit in the Ceremonies and Shadows of the Law, as the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſomtime did, and the falſe Teachers, who would have ſeduced the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> or that ſeek it in their own merits, and the merits of Creatures; they all, I ſay, and all that are like them, let themſelves be carried away from the hope of the Goſpel. Then again, the Goſpel promiſeth us eternal life in the heavens, by the grace of GOD in His Son. Thoſe therefore quit the hope thereof alſo, who ſeek their felicity either in the, earth or in heaven otherways, than by the ſole mercy of the LORD. Whereby it doth appear, how very pertinently S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth recommend this hope of the Goſpel unto the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> For in the combat wherein they were engaged, it was ſufficient to preſerve them from all the attempts of the Impoſtors. What have I to do (ſaith this Hope) with the obſervation of your Diſciplines, or the quirks of your Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; ſince I abundantly have in my Goſpel, all the good things which you vainly promiſe me? But becauſe it is ordinary with falſe Teachers, to abuſe the name of the Goſpel, and to give it to the Fopperies and Vanities which they preach; S. <hi>Paul</hi> to put the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> out of all doubt and ambiguity, indicateth expreſly to them, what this Goſpel is of which he ſpeaketh, <hi>That</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which you have heard,</hi> namely, of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who had preached it among them, and to whom he gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an excellent Teſtimonial for fidelity and ſincerity. I mean (ſaith he) the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel which you receiv'd at the beginning, from the mouth of true Servants of GOD, and not theſe vain and dangerous Doctrines, which evil workers would make to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50919:59"/>paſs with you for the Goſpel of CHRIST, though they be nothing leſs then ſo. But to confirm them the more in the faith, he ſets before them in the ſecond place, an excellent encomium of the Goſpel, which containeth a clear proof of its truth, ſaying, <hi>That it is the Goſpel which was preached to every creature under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> It is not the Doctrine which theſe falſe Apoſtles ſowed here and there in ſome out quarters, whiſpering, and privily advancing the ſame among light and unſtable ſpirits. It is the true Word of the Son of GOD, which had been proclaimed through the whole Univerſe, by His command, and according to the Oracles of His ancient Prophets: That Word, which going forth from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did ſpread its ſelf every way in a very little time; and being accompanied with the power of its Author, made it ſelf be heard and believed in all the Provinces of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable earth, in ſpight of the contradictions of Hell and the world. His aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Goſpel was <hi>preached to every creature which is under heaven,</hi> may be expounded two manner of ways; but both of them amounting to the ſame ſenſe. Firſt, by a Figure, very common in Divine and Humane ſpeech, the word <hi>Creature</hi> may be taken for Man, the nobleſt and moſt excellent of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And the LORD had ſo uſed the word before in the ſame matter, when He commanded His Apoſtles to do what S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth <hi>magnifie</hi> in this place. <hi>Go ye forth</hi> (ſaid He to them) <hi>into all the world, and preach the Goſpel unto every creature:</hi> Where it is evident, that by <hi>every creature,</hi> He underſtandeth men, who alone are capable of hearing and receiving what is preached. In this ſenſe, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the Goſpel was preached to every creature;</hi> it is as much as if he had ſaid, to all mankind, and among all ſorts of men; agreeably to what he ſaith here a little after, ſpeaking of himſelf, that <hi>he admoniſheth every man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 1.28.</note> 
                        <hi>and teacheth every man in all wiſdom.</hi> Secondly, theſe words, <hi>To every creature,</hi> may in my opinion, be taken alſo, as ſignifying, in all the world; and this the rather, becauſe it is literally in the Original, <hi>in all the creature,</hi> with the Article <hi>the,</hi> and not ſimply, <hi>to every creature.</hi> Now that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes uſeth this term, <hi>the creature,</hi> to ſignifie the world, this great body and collection of all things which GOD hath created: this is manifeſtly to be ſeen in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.19, 20, 21.</note> 
                        <hi>That the great and ardent deſire of the creature waiteth for the manifeſtation of the children of GOD;</hi> and again, <hi>That the creature was made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to vanity;</hi> and more a little after, <hi>That all the creature groaneth and travelleth in pain together until now,</hi> where it is clear and confeſſed by the greateſt part of Interpreters, that <hi>the creature,</hi> ſignifies the world; and our Bibles to make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it the better, do change the ſingular number into the plural, rendring it (<hi>les creatures,</hi> and <hi>toutes les creatures</hi>) the creatures, and all the creatures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Original readeth ſimply, <hi>the creature,</hi> and <hi>all the creature.</hi> Taking it thus therefore in this place, when the Apoſtle ſaith, the <hi>Goſpel was preached in all the creature which is under heaven,</hi> he meaneth, in all the world wherein we dwell; wherein GOD hath ſeated mankind beneath the heavens. I will make no ſtay here now, to ſhew you how it might be truly ſaid in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of our LORD was then preached to all mankind, or in all the habitable world; or how this event is a clear and ſolid proof of its truth. We have already heretofore handled, both the one and the other of theſe two particulars, in expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if you remember) the ſixth Verſe of this Chapter, which affirmed, that the Goſpel was come unto all the world. Upon that Text, which ſignifies no other thing than what the Apoſtle ſaith here, namely, that the Goſpel hath been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>all the creature which is under heaven:</hi> We ſhewed firſt, by good and irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable teſtimonies of Ancient Writers, both Chriſtian and Pagan, that the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word had been preached within the Apoſtles days, in all Countreys then known either to Greeks or Romans, and receiv'd for the moſt part with fruit; ſo as taking the word <hi>World</hi> (according to the ſtile of all Languages) not ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely for all the parts of the Terreſtrial Globe, but only for thoſe which at that time were known to men, and which they underſtood to be inhabited; it might be ſaid with truth, and without any over-reaching Hyperbole, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth here, that <hi>the Goſpel had been preached in all the creature which is under heaven,</hi> that is, in all the world. And in the ſecond place we proved, both by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50919:60"/>the importance of the thing it ſelf, and by the reſpect it hath to the Oracles of the Old Teſtament, which had predicted it many ages before its event, that this ſo ſwift, ſo ſudden, and ſo admirable running of the Goſpel through all the world, in ſo few years, is a certain and infallible evidence, of the verity and divinity of this holy Doctrine, obliging conſequently, both the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> heretofore, and us at preſent, to hold faſt, and perſevere in the faith which we have given to it, without ſuffering our ſelves to be ever mov'd away from it, either by the cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arts of falſe Teachers, and their crafty Seducements, or by the Threatnings and Perſecutions of the world. Theſe things having been heretofore largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and opened to you, leſt the repition of them ſhould be irkſome, I will paſs to the third head of our Text, wherein the Apoſtle ſets before the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> another Character of true Chriſtian Doctrine, to wit, that it is the Word, the Miniſtery whereof was committed to him. <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Goſpel, of which I Paul have been made a Miniſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He oppoſeth his heavenly call, to the temerity of the falſe Teachers, who ran without having been ſent; and preached not what Heaven commanded them, but what earth inſpir'd them with; their impulſions and inſtructions being from fleſh and blood, and not from the LORD JESUS. It was otherwiſe with <hi>Paul;</hi> all the faithful knew him to have been called from heaven, and ſuddenly changed by the efficacy of Divine power from a Wolf into a Paſtor; made an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald and witneſs of the Goſpel, immediately by the LORD JESUS, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in His miraculous School, illuminated and conſecrated by His Spirit. Who could doubt, but that it was from the mouth of this holy man, that the Myſteries of GOD ſhould be learned; and that what was contrary to His Doctrine, ought to be judged falſe and vain. I confeſs, his Miſſion was extraordinary and miraculous, and is not to be made a precedent for others. Yet notwithſtanding what he here ſaith of it, affordeth us two Inſtructions, which reach all Paſtors generally. The firſt is, that they ſhould never intrude themſelves into this Sacred Office, if GOD call them not; ſo as they may ſay with good conſcience, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth in this place, that they have been made Miniſters of the Goſpel. It is true, JESUS CHRIST now ſpeaketh not to men from heaven, as He yerſt did to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to call them unto His work. But ſo much He doth, that He maketh us perceive His will; firſt, by the moving of His Spirit within us, which never faileth to incite us to His work, when GOD calleth us thereto: and ſecondly, by the voyce and authority of His Church, that is to ſay, of His faithful people, to the Body and Community of whom, He hath given the power to apply the right of this Miniſtry to ſuch as they diſcern meet for it; as the examples of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, regiſtred in the Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and elſwhere do ſhew us. And as for Ordination (as it is called) which is done by the Impoſition of the hands of other Miniſters already eſtabliſhed, I confeſs it alſo ought to intervene for the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crowning of the call; accordingly you ſee it is ſeriouſly practiſed among us: But I add, that it is not yet ſo abſolutely requiſite, but that in caſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and invincible neceſſity, as in places and times, when there are no true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of JESUS CHRIST found to give it, the call of the Church, that is, of a body of faithful people, may ſuffice to a valid inſtituting of a Paſtor; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuppoſed, to have the ability and inclination requiſite for ſuch a charge. The other particular that we have to learn here is, That all Paſtors, of what rank ſoever they may be, are Miniſters, and not Maſters of the Goſpel. It's the title which the Apoſtle here aſſumeth, according to the Declaration he makes elſwhere, that <hi>he hath no dominion over the faith of believers;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.24.</note> but is <hi>an helper of their joy.</hi> The duty of a Miniſter is to propoſe, what hath been committed to Him; what he hath received of the Maſter. If he go beyond it, and will have his own will, and his private imaginations bear ſway, he is no longer a Miniſter; he doth the act of a Maſter; and conſequently ſets up a tyranny, ſince the Church neither hath, nor can have any lawful Maſter, but JESUS CHRIST.

And bleſſed be GOD, who hitherto ſo ſettled you in the belief of His Word, that neither the forcible attempts of open Enemies, nor the fraud of falſe friends, hath been able to remove you at all.

To this purpoſe, let us continually read and meditate that heavenly Word, whence we have drawn it. Let us fill our ſouls with this Divine wiſdom, and render it familiar to us. Let us inſtruct our youth in it. Let us make it to abound on all hands among us.

                        <q>The reading of the holy Scriptures is an excellent and an aſſured Preſervative, to keep us from falling into ſin; and ignorance of the Scriptures is an huge Precipice, a deep gulf of Perdition.</q> In the deſign of our perſeverance, let us particularly make uſe of the two means which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here furniſheth us withal: The one, that the Goſpel which we have heard, hath been preach'd in the whole world; the other, that it is the ſame which was committed to our Apoſtle. It's in the belief of this Goſpel, that he would have us abide firm. It's to this faith, that he promiſeth the peace of GOD, His Favour, and His Eternity. <hi>GOD</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath reconciled you to Himſelf, that He might preſent you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without ſpot, and unreproveable; if indeed you continue firm in the faith, and are not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel.</hi> From whence it follows, that if we have this Goſpel among us, we may certainly aſſure our ſelves, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, we ſhall obtain the peace, and the Salvation of GOD. The only queſtion therefore is, Whether the Doctrine which we have embraced be truly this Goſpel or no? If it be, I have no further ſearch to make. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have found what is ſufficient for me, that I may appear before my GOD without confuſion, and receive of Him life everlaſting. But that the Doctrine whereof we make profeſſion, is the ſame Goſpel that <hi>Paul</hi> preached; the ſame that he and the other Apoſtles ſowed in the world, and which the world, overcome by the force of its truth, did in the end receive and adore: This, I ſay, is ſo clear, that I do not think the Devil himſelf, as hardned in impudence as he is, can deny it. For the GOD whom we ſerve; and the CHRIST, whom we adore; and His Merit, in which we truſt; and the Worſhip we give Him in Spirit, and in truth; and the Heaven, we hope for; and the Sacraments we celebrate, and all the other Articles of our Religion, do they not every where appear, in the Books of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? Are they not to be ſeen in all the Monuments of theſe great men, as well in their Writings, as alſo in the Churches which they planted through the earth? Let us therefore, my Brethren, abide firm in this faith, ſince it moſt aſſuredly is the Goſpel which was heretofore preached in all the world, and was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s miniſtring. And if thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> do alledge to us their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50919:61"/>and Traditions; let us boldly tell them, that if thoſe things were any part of the Goſpel, they would appear in what the Apoſtles preached; to whom JESUS CHRIST gave the Miniſtry thereof. And in the mean time, there is not found any one of them in the Sacred Volumes, which they have left us, to be the rule of our faith. Neither the adoration of the Hoaſt, nor the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Images, nor the invocation of Saints departed; nor the other points for which they have Excommunicated us. And herein their Head doth evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover, how Apoſtolical he is; to baniſh thoſe from his Communion, whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> here expreſly declares, to be at peace with GOD, holy and unreprovable before Him. For, to have this happineſs, he doth not oblige us to believe or practice this pretended Goſpel of <hi>Rome.</hi> He requireth us, only abide firm in the belief of his, the Goſpel which he preached to the faithful, and left in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. In them our Religion is to be ſeen, full and whole. But not one Article of that which <hi>Rome</hi> would by all means conſtrain us to receive. But there is no need we ſhould make further ſtay upon this matter; the truth of that Doctrine which we embrace being ſo clear, that no man who underſtands Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and owns the Divinity of it, can call it into queſtion: And on the other hand, the abſurdity of the Doctrine we reject, is ſo palpable, and ſo rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beats againſt the foundations of Reaſon and Scripture, that it s very difficult for a man, who hath had any taſte of the Goſpel, ever to yield up his conſent to the errors we conteſt; except GOD have blinded him in puniſhment of his ingratitude. The great combate which we have moſt cauſe to fear, is that of the paſſions of our fleſh. It's theſe properly that enfeeble faith, that darken its light, that hide the truth from its view, and paint up error. Theſe are the true cauſes of their change, who deſert us; and of the offence of many, that are infirm among us. Experience ſhews it us daily. And accordingly you ſee,
<note place="margin">Matth. 13.21, 22.</note> our Saviour hath advertis'd us of it; having ſaid in one of His Parables, that it is either the fear of perſecution, or the cares of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches, that makes the ſeed of heaven unfruitful in the hearts of men, and obſtructs their perſeverance. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſomwhere imformeth us,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.19.</note> that they that reject a good conſcience, make ſhipwrack alſo in reſpect of faith. When a man is once ſold over to pleaſure, or avarice, or ambition, it is no wonder, if in the ſequel, he diſguſt the truth, and fall into error. The paſſage is eaſie from the one to the other. Beſides, the ſlaves of ſin, not finding the contentation of their paſſions, in the profeſſion of Truth, which is for the moſt part under the croſs; their intereſt carries them to ſeek their ſatisfaction in the world: this gives an huge ſhake to their minds, and brings them by degres to reliſh the worlds ſide and party; as it is natural to us, to believe eaſily the things we deſire. Here therefore it is, dear Brethren, that we muſt put to our might, and fight in good earneſt, if we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue firm in the faith. Give me a man, that embracing JESUS CHRIST, hath caſt off the luſts of the fleſh, and of the world, and I will be ſecure of his perſeverance. Take me away the colours, wherewith avarice, and ambition, and vanity, do paint-over error, in the thoughts of the worldly-minded, and I will not fear its ſeducing of any. Cleanſe your Conſcience, and your Faith will be out of danger. The Devil, without doubt, made uſe of his beſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons againſt our LORD; and you know, that having repreſented to Him, the hunger, and the neceſſity he was in, he omitted not to ſpread before His eyes the pomp of the Grandeurs, and riches of the world. It is a wile he ſtill puts in practiſe; and his Miniſters do not forget this piece of his play: they fail not to tell ſuch, as they would deſtroy, that they will give them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Faithful Brethren, let us fence our ſelves ſeaſonably againſt this tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Mortifie we in us all the luſts of Fleſh and Earth, accuſtom our ſelves to a not-dreading the Croſs, and the ſufferings of our LORD; ſuffer not the world to dazle our eyes. Look we upon it, as a deceitful ſhew, unable to content its own adorers. To the falſe goods, wherewith it feedeth its bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50919:61"/>let us oppoſe the true ones, which the Goſpel promiſeth. Let the ſweet and noble hope of theſe, enflame our ſouls with an ardent deſire of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and its immortality. Let it ſweeten all the bitterneſs that attends our profeſſion, and make execrable to us, all that tendeth to turn us away from ſo bleſſed a deſign. Courage, Chriſtian; yet a little patience, and you have overcome. Your faith, if you abide firm in it, will open in your heart for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, a living ſpring of ſuch joy, as is a thouſand times ſweeter than all the pleaſures of Worldings: And it ſhall be crowned one day, with that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent and immortal glory, which the Goſpel that you have believed, doth promiſe to all thoſe, which ſhall conſtantly perſevere in the Vocation of the LORD JESUS. <hi>To whom with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, the true and only GOD, bleſſed for ever, be all honor, and praiſe to ages of ages.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>THE Goſpel of the LORD JESUS hath many admirable evidences of its divinity, and among them, the ſufferings of its Confeſſors, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs are, in my opinion, not the leaſt illuſtrious. For if you ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them, you will find, that there never was any doctrine in the world, that drew more perſecutions upon its followers; or that inſpired them, with ſo much courage, and reſolution to undergo the ſame; or was, in effect, ſealed with ſuch a deal of blood and patience. Other religions, as being ſprung from the earth, are welcome there; and the world that well knoweth its own blood, and its own ſpirit, ſhews them kindneſs, and receives them gladly. The alliance alſo which there is between them, being all of them fruits and productions of the fleſh, makes them mutually bear with one another. And if ſome jealouſy at any time, do raiſe in any of them, ſome averſion for the reſt, this paſſion ſeldom carries them ſo far, as to an open perſecution. But as ſoon as Chriſtianity appeared, they all turned their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and their violence againſt it, as againſt a Religion, that was a ſtranger, and of a quite different original and extraction from theirs. Who is able to report the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exceſſes of the world againſt this innocent diſcipline? and the horrid calamities, to which it condemned the profeſſors of it, baniſhing them out of all its countries, ſtripping them of all its honours and poſſeſſions; burning them, and maſſacring them and mercileſly employing its brute creatures, and its elements, againſt them? Yet theſe cruelties did not aſtoniſh the faithful; They bore them generouſly, and would rather loſe all that was dear to them, even to their very blood and life it ſelf, than renounce JESUS CHRIST. Of ſo many falſe religions, as were up in the wind among men heretofore, in the time of Paganiſm, name but one that was conſecrated in ſuch a manner. Of all the ſects of Philoſophy, which <hi>Greece</hi> yer-while brought forth, and the old ſages ſo haughtily boaſted of, ſhew me one, that gave its diſciples the courage to ſuffer for it; or was watered with their blood. Indeed I will not deny, but that ſome perſons have been, and ſtill are found to ſuffer for falſe religions. But Firſt, this happens not, ſave when long uſe, and the ſuperſtition of many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have authoriſed the belief of them; whereas the faithful ſuffered for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, at the firſt ſpringing forth of it, before that the conſent of people, or the authority of Princes had ſtrengthn'd it, or any other of ſuch humane conſiderations made it plauſible. Then again, thoſe ſufferings for error are very rare, they be the ſufferings of ſome few perſons only, one here, and another there, whom vanity or melancholy may puſh on ſo far; Whereas Chriſtians ſuffered by thouſands, of all ages, of each ſex, of every rank and condition, ſo as their reſolution can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to no other motive but their religion. Who can doubt, but Mahometiſm, and Paganiſm would have been immediately extinct, if they had been expoſed to the like trials? Whereas Chriſtianity was eſtabliſhed by them: it flouriſhed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50919:62"/>in the flames; and the ruder ſhocks that perſecution gave it, the deeper root it took. And this Character is ſo eſſential, to this Divine diſcipline, that in the time of our fathers, when GOD cauſed it to come forth, once again into publick light, it eſcaped not the ſame treatment that it antiently had; nor did it fail to make proof of its truth by the ſame ſufferings, confeſſions, and martyrdoms which had accompanied its firſt birth. Hereto I further add, that the ſufferings of other religions, when any be, are with conſtraint and fear, or mixed with pride, and obſtinate ferocity, whereas, in thoſe of the Goſpel, there ſhine forth humilty, and modeſty; charity, and ſweetneſs; coeleſtial conſolation, and joy. Such, at the erecting of Chriſtianity, were the ſufferings of the Apoſtles, and of their Diſciples. For which cauſe, S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions his, here to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> in purſuance of the deſign he had to confirm their faith. <hi>I now rejoyce</hi> (ſaith he to them) <hi>in my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for you,</hi> &amp;c. — To keep the faith of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> in its purity, and to ſecure it from the leaven, which the ſeducers would mix with it, he repreſented to them (if you remember) in the precedent Text, two ſtrong arguments of the truth of the Goſpel. One taken from its extention, for that it had been preached through all the world in a very little time; whereas the new doctrine, wherewith there was endeavour to infect them, had been heard but here and there in ſome by corners. The other drawn from the miracles of his own call: for that it was the doctrine, the miniſtration whereof, our Saviour had authentically and magnificently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him; Whereas He had given no perſon any order, to preach thoſe traditions, wherewith ſome would burthen them. But becauſe this was a matter of great importance, he ſpends the reſt of this chapter, in grounding and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſhewing by divers means, the truth of His Heavenly call. And firſt, he confirms it in this verſe, by the ſufferings which he chearfully and willingly bore, to anſwer that call; ſecretly oppoſing this condition of his, to the condition of the falſe teachers, who were exempted from the croſs, by the profeſſion they made of obſerving <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law. That I (ſaith he) am ſent of GOD, and a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of His, theſe great combats which I ſuſtein, and the afflictions which I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſuffer, do evidently ſhew you. For inſteed of fearing them, or being aſham'd of them, I rejoyce in them; and it highly contents me to confirm my preaching, with this divine ſeal of JESUS CHRIST's, even the cheerful bearing of His croſs; becauſe I am not ignorant, how neceſſary this deportment is in His School, where no one lives without ſuffering; and how profitable it is for His myſtical body, that is to ſay, the Church whom He hath united with Himſelf, and of whom He hath made me a Miniſter. This is the ſumm of what the Apoſtle delivers to us here, in the matter of his afflictions; and that we may the better underſtand it, we will conſider, Firſt, the manner how he bore them, which he expreſſeth in theſe words. <hi>I now rejoyce in my ſufferings for you;</hi> and next in order, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this his rejoycing, taken from the nature of thoſe afflictions, which were the reſt of the ſufferings of CHRIST, which I do fill up (ſaith he) in my fleſh: and finally the object, or the uſe of them, in that he ſuffered them, for the body of CHRIST, which is the Church. Theſe are the three points, that we will explain, the grace of GOD aſſiſting in this action. The Apoſtles joy in the nature of his ſufferings; and the end or utility of them: we will eſtabliſh and make good the truth of his ſentiments, and refute the attempts that error makes, to force out ſome advantage from his words; the whole, with as much perſpicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and brevity, as we may.</p>
                     <p>Although it be true in general, that all thoſe who will live godly in CHRIST JESUS, do ſuffer perſecution; yet this is particularly verified in the Miniſters of the Goſpel; who not content with the ſingle embracement of this profeſſion, do undertake to draw others to it, and guide them in it. This charge expoſeth them, more than the reſt of the faithful, to the hatred, and violence of the world. S. <hi>Pauls</hi>'s hiſtory doth clearly evince it. For he had no ſooner received this ſacred Miniſtry; but he ſaw the Jews, and the Heathen riſe againſt him, as by common agreement. His whole life from that moment was nothing but a Series of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the Spirit of Him, who had called him, did fortify him in ſuch a manner, that he ſuſteined them all, not only patiently, and conſtantly, but even cheerfully,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50919:63"/>and there was not one of them, of which it might not be ſaid, but that he rejoyced in ſuffering it. Nevertheleſs it is evident, that in this place, he ſpeaks of one of his afflictions in particular, and not of them all in general. For his ſaying, I now rejoyce in my afflictions, doth intimate that he meaneth his preſent ſufferings, thoſe he was in when he wrote this Epiſtle, and not others that were paſt. Every one knows the eſtate he was then in; that he lay a priſoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> bound in a chain for the Goſpel. It is therefore of this perſecution that we muſt underſtand him. It is this priſon, and this chain, and the inconveniences, pain and ignominy that attended them in reſpect of the fleſh, which he ſignifies by his afflictions. But the queſtion is, how he ſaith, that it is for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> he was afflicted? <hi>I rejoyce</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in my ſufferings for you.</hi> It appears not in the hiſtory of this perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his, which we have at large in the book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that theſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people had contributed ought thereto; that they had been either the cauſe, or the occaſion of it. To this I anſwer, that if you exactly conſider this ſacred hiſtory, you will eaſily find wherewith to reſolve this difficulty. For it is evident, that the hatred of the <hi>Jews</hi> his accuſers and perſecuters, who raiſed up this long affliction upon him, was principally cauſed by that commerce, which this holy man ordinarily had with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he imparting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to them, and receiving them into the communion of the people of GOD, without obliging them to obſerve the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> It was this that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly kindled their paſſion againſt S. <hi>Paul.</hi> They ſuffered S. <hi>James,</hi> and divers others of the Diſciples, who exerciſed their Miniſtry among thoſe of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, as you ſee in the <hi>Acts.</hi> But as for S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who taught the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and freely communicated the myſteries of GOD to them, him they could not bear; They cry out as ſoon as they ſee him,
<note place="margin">Acts 21.28, 29.</note> Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> help. Behold the man, that teacheth all men every where againſt the people, and the law, and this place. And they add in particular, that he had brought <hi>Greeks</hi> into the Temple, and polluted that holy place: imagining, he had cauſed a Diſciple of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Trophimus,</hi> to enter in there; becauſe they had ſeen him in the City. Hereupon the Apoſtle was made priſoner, by the Captain of the Citadel, and from thence ſent to <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> and two years after to <hi>Rome.</hi> So you ſee, that the commerce he had with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the care he took of their converſion, according to the charge given him concerning it from on high, was the true cauſe that brought all this tedious, and terrible tempeſt upon him: Since therefore the <hi>Colloſſians</hi> were of the number of <hi>Gentiles;</hi> conſidering them here under this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, he had reaſon to ſay, that it was for them he ſuffered; it being evident, that he incurred the trouble, he was at that time under; for having opened, by his ſacred Miniſtry, the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to them, and others of their quality. And thus he explains himſelf about it, in another place, where ſpeaking of the ſame perſecution that is in queſtion here,
<note place="margin">Eph 3.1.</note> I <hi>Paul,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>am the Priſoner of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, for the</hi> Gentiles. He expreſly nameth, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under which the <hi>Epheſians</hi> had a part in his bonds, to wit, as they were <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The truth is, he was not impriſoned, on the occaſion of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> or the <hi>Colloſſians</hi> in particular; but in general, becauſe of the ſervice he did to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> converting them, and admitting them to the communion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD. And let none object, that he had never preached in perſon to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> Some doubt it. But ſuppoſe, he had not; it ſufficeth, that thoſe, who had converted them, as <hi>Epaphras,</hi> and others, had done it by his order, and after his example, and under his authority, he being the perſon who had preaching to the uncircumciſion committed to him; and to whom the LORD from Heaven had given the charge to go unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 26.17, 18.</note> for the opening of their eyes, and for converting them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD, that they might receive the remiſſion of their ſins, and inheritance among them, which are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith. Hereafter we ſhall find him declaring, yet more plainly to thoſe faithful people, that they, and the reſt of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were the occaſion of his ſufferings; <hi>I would</hi> (ſaith he to them) <hi>that ye knew, what great conflict I have for you, and for them at</hi> Laodicea, <hi>and for as many as have not ſeen my face in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50919:63"/>the Fleſh.</hi> In all which the holy prudence of the Apoſtle doth appear; who, to win the hearts of theſe believers, and thereupon diſpoſe them, to the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of his inſtructions, beſides the authority of his Office, which he ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, doth expreſly intimate to them, the affection he bore them, and the zeal he had for their ſalvation: both ſuch, as to gain them unto GOD, he ſtuck not, to be caſt into ſo long, and ſo grievous a perſecution, and far from repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he ſtill rejoyced in it to that very hour: an evident ſign, that if it were to commence again; the conſideration of that hard priſon, ſhould not with-hold him at all, from exerciſing his miniſtry towards them, and the other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in the ſame manner he had done. It is thus, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> took all the afflictions, wherein the Goſpel, and the edification of men did engage him.
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.10.</note> 
                        <hi>I ſuffer all things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the elects ſake, that they alſo may obtain the ſalvation, which is in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> And to them that would have deverted him,

For I am ready, not only to be bound, but alſo to dye at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for the name of the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> He faithfully makes good, what he had promiſed them. He generouſly undergoes his bonds. The tumult, and fury, of an enraged people, did not daunt him. The conſpiracy of his enemies, the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of his judges, the perils of the Sea, did not mollify him, at all. The tediouſneſs of a long impriſonment, did not change him at all. Behold him, how he yet proteſteth, that he rejoyceth in his afflictions. He is as freſh, and as vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as if he were but now entring upon them. Indeed it is thus, that we ought to ſuffer for JESUS CHRIST. It is not enough, to afford it patience; there muſt be joy in it. It is not enough, to go forth under the Croſs, without murmuring. There muſt be marching on with alacrity. He that follows His Captain weeping is but a ſorry ſouldier; The men of valour, do deport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves gladſomly, on ſuch occaſions. S. <hi>Paul</hi> goes yet further.
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.3.</note> He would have us to glory in ſuch kind of tribulations, and triumph, becauſe of them. So did the Apoſtles; who having been ignominiouſly whipt, by the decree of the Council of the <hi>Jews, rejoyced</hi> (ſaith the Holy Hiſtory,) <hi>that they were counted worthy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 5.41.</note> 
                        <hi>to ſuffer ſhame for the name of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> I confeſs ſuch joy, in occurrences, that would poſſeſs all other men with ſhame, and ſadneſs, is ſtrange; I confeſs it is contrary to the ſentiments of nature, and doth exceed its ſtrength. Yet I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it is juſt; and for all that it is above the reach of our reaſon, will be found a very rational joy.</p>
                     <p>That this may the better appear, let us now conſider the two reaſons of it, which the Apoſtle alledgeth here, when he addeth, <hi>And I do fill up the reſt of the afflictions of CHRIST, in my fleſh, for His body, which is the Church.</hi> The word (and,) which knitteth theſe words, with the foregoing, is put here, as in many other places of Scripture, for one of thoſe particles, which hey call cauſal. <hi>I rejoyce in my ſufferings for you, and do fill up the reſt of the afflictions,</hi> &amp;c. that is foraſmuch as I fill up, or becauſe I do fill up what remaineth of the afflictions of CHRIST; as ſome of the beſt, and moſt learned interpreters have well obſerved. The firſt of theſe two reaſons, which induced the Apoſtle, to receive the ſufferings of the Goſpel with joy, is taken (as you ſee) from hence, even that by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going them, he did fill up the reſt of the afflictions of CHRIST, in his fleſh. Firſt, it is clear, that by the afflictions of CHRIST, he doth not mean the troubles, which the LORD JESUS himſelf did ſuffer, in His own perſon, during the days of His fleſh, whereof His death on the Croſs was the laſt, and the chief; the end and crowning of them all. For neither S. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any of the writers of the New Teſtament, doth ever uſe the term, affliction, to expreſs thoſe ſufferings of our LORD. They are alwaies termed, either His paſſion, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or His tentations; as in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 2.9. 1 Pet. 1.11.</note> 
                        <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S was made a little lower than the Angels, through the paſſion of His death;</hi> And in S. <hi>Peter;</hi> The Spirit declared the ſufferings, that ſhould afterward come upon CHRIST; and ſo elſewhere. Secondly, the afflictions of CHRIST, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks in this place, were not finiſhed; there remained ſtill ſome part of them to be filled up; whereas the LORDS's perſonal ſufferings, were perfectly
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50919:64"/>compleated on the Croſs; ſo as in this behalf, there remained nothing more, for Him to ſuffer; according to what Himſelf teſtified, when he cryed, with a loud voice, before he gave up the ghoſt. It is finiſhed; and according to what the Apoſtle teacheth,
<note place="margin">Rom 6.9.10. Heb. 9.28.</note> in divers places; namely, <hi>that CHRIST dyed for ſin once; that henceforth He dyeth no more; but liveth unto GOD; and that He was once offered, to take away the ſins of many.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> do confeſs it, and even complain, that they ſhould be charged, with having other thoughts in the matter; they acknowledge it would be groſs blaſphemy, to ſay, that the ſufferings of the LORD JESUS, by which He expiated our ſins on the Croſs, do want any thing, that ſhould be ſupplied, either by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other man. What then are theſe afflictions of CHRIST which are ſpoken of here? Dear Brethren, they are thoſe, that the Apoſtle ſuffered, for the name of the LORD, and in His communion, and by reaſon of the miniſtry, wherewith He had honoured him. For it is the ſtile of theſe divine men, to give this title, to all that the faithful ſuffer,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.5.</note> for this holy, and glorious cauſe. <hi>As the ſufferings of CHRIST abound in us,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſo by CHRIST, doth our conſolation abound.</hi> Where you clearly ſee, is ſignified, by the ſufferings of CHRIST, not that, which the LORD ſuffered in His own perſon, but that which the Apoſtle ſuffered for Him.
<note place="margin">Phil. 3, 10.</note> And elſewhere again when he ſaith, that he deſired to be found in CHRIST, to the end he might know the fellowſhip of his ſufferings; that is, thoſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, by which all His faithful ones are conſecrated, after His example. The ſame,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.8. 2 Cor. 15.</note> he elſewhere calleth, the afflictions of the Goſpel: and in the ſame manner, the dying of the LORD JESUS, which he ſaith he beareth about in his body; juſt as he ſaith here, that he filleth up the afflictions of CHRIST, in his fleſh. And, in my judgement, it is the ſame, that he meaneth, at the end of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he glorieth of bearing in his body, the brandings of the LORD JESUS,
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.17.</note> becauſe afflictions are as it were, the mark, that JESUS CHRIST imprinteth in the fleſh of His ſervants, the ſeal and badge of His houſe. So in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he termeth, the low and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful condition, the afflictions and incommodities of the people of GOD, <hi>the reproach of CHRIST;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11.26.</note> ſaying, <hi>that</hi> Moſes <hi>eſteemed the reproach of CHRIST, greater riches, than the treaſures of</hi> Egypt.</p>
                     <p>If you now ask me the reaſon of this kind of ſpeech, it is not difficult to be found. For firſt, Since it is for the name of the LORD, for His cauſe, and in his ſuit, that the faithful are afflicted; <hi>ſuffering</hi> (according to S. <hi>Peters</hi> advice) <hi>not as murtherers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.15.16.</note> 
                        <hi>or thieves, or evil-doers, or buſy in other mens matters, but as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi> all the wounds that they receive upon this account, are juſtly called the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of CHRIST. Since He is the cauſe, and the true occaſion of them; it is reaſon to attribute them to Him, and to ſay, that they are His. Secondly, There is ſo ſtrict an union, between the LORD, and all His true members, that they with Him, make up but one body, as the Apoſtle will preſently tell us. And by vertue of this conjunction, we have part both in His glory, and, in ſome ſort, in His very Name; as the Apoſtle intimateth, when he compareth this myſtical body to a natural body,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12.</note> and ſaith, <hi>that As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body: ſo likewiſe is CHRIST.</hi> Under the Name of CHRIST there, S. <hi>Paul</hi> compriſeth, not only the perſon of the LORD JESUS, but with Him, the whole multitude of His faithful ones. And conſidering them, as united together; He gives the Name CHRIST to this whole body, which is compoſed of the LORD, as the head, and of the faithful, as members. Whereby it appears, that all that the faithful do ſuffer, each for his ſhare, doth make up part of the afflictions of CHRIST. As you know we call thoſe hurts ours, which we receive, in any one of our members, whether the hand or the foot. <hi>Paul</hi> is the hand of CHRIST, as one of the members of His body, yea one of the moſt excellent. Surely then, all that he ſuffereth partaineth to CHRIST. It's His affliction, and His hurt. None of the wounds of His ſervant is alien to Him. And you ſee, even among men; it's an offending a Prince, to offend His Miniſter; it's an affronting the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to injure the wife: to fall upon the ſervant, is to make battery on the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50919:64"/>Maſter. Though the union of theſe ranks of perſons be nothing ſo ſtrict, or ſo intimate, as that of JESUS CHRIST, and the faithful; yet it ſufficeth to denominate thoſe outrages and injuries, the Prince's, the Husbands, or the Maſters injuries, which are done to the perſons, that appertain to them under that relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Accordingly you ſee, in the courſe of civil affairs, men intereſs themſelves as much in ſuch kind of cauſes, and take as heinouſly, or more the outrages done to perſons depending on them, and dear to them, than thoſe that are directly aimed at themſelves. Thus in the Heavenly State of the Church, JESUS CHRIST owneth, both the good, and the evil, that is done to His faithful ones. He ſaith of thoſe that viſit, that comfort, and feed His poor members; that they viſit, and comfort, and feed Himſelf. Of thoſe that refuſe them theſe good offices, He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that they have denied them to Him. And <hi>Paul</hi> had learned this leſſon from His own mouth. For when, in the darkneſs of his ignorance, he, agitated with the fury of his zeal without knowledge, perſecuted the Diſciples. JESUS had cryed to him from Heaven: <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 9.4.</note> It is me thou outrageſt, in the perſon of thoſe faithful people, whom thou purpoſeſt to bind, and impriſon. Thou dealeſt them never a blow, but reacheth me. I miſs not, by being in Heaven, to bear a part in all, that they ſuffer one earth. The blood, thou draweſt from them, is mine; and as their perſons belong to me, ſo all their afflictions, and torments are mine. The Apoſtle inſtructed by this Divine oracle, boldly calleth afflictions of CHRIST, all that which he ſuffered, after he had the honour to be His.</p>
                     <p>But he doth not barely ſay here, that he ſuffereth the afflictions of CHRIST. He ſaith, he fills up the reſt, or that which is behind, that, which was yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. To underſtand it aright, we muſt remember, what he teacheth us elſewhere, to wit, <hi>that whom GOD hath foreknown,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> 
                        <hi>He hath alſo predeſtinated to be conformed to the image of His Son; that He might be the firſt born among many brethren;</hi> And that one of the principal parts of this conformity, is their ſuffering here below, and their partaking of the croſs of CHRIST, according to the conſtant advertiſement He giveth us, in Scripture; as, that if any one will follow Him, he do take up his Croſs; that ſuch, as will live godly in Him, ſhall ſuffer perſecution; and that it is by many afflictions, GOD leadeth us into His Kingdom. Now as the wiſdom, and underſtanding of the LORD, is infinite, He hath not only ordeined this, in general: but hath defined, and decreed in His eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal counſel, both what the whole body of the Church ſhall bear in groſs, and what each of the faithful, of whom this body is compoſed, ſhall ſuffer in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; through what trials he ſhall paſs; where his exerciſes ſhall begin, and where they ſhall end. And as His hand,
<note place="margin">Acts 4.28. 1 Pet. 1.20.</note> and His counſel had before determined all, that the LORD JESUS ſuffered, in His own perſon; by reaſon whereof S. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth Him, <hi>the Lamb, that was pre-ordeined before the foundations of the world:</hi> So likewiſe hath He reſolved upon, and formed, in the light of His eternal Providence, the whole lot of each one of the faithful; all the parts, and paſſes of their combat. The caſe of the head, and of the members is alike. There doth not any thing betide them, by meer chance. The procedure, and proportion of their whole laborious courſe, is cut out, and faſhioned before all ages. According to this holy, and veritable doctrine, the Apoſtle doubted not, but that His task was ordained, in the counſel of His GOD, and the number of his ſufferings determined, and the quality of them regulated. Having then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſpatched a good part of them, he meaneth here, that which remained for him yet to finiſh according to the counſel of GOD. I accompliſh (ſaith he) in my preſent ſufferings, <hi>the remainder of the afflictions of CHRIST.</hi> I diſpatch my task by little and little, and what I now ſuffer, makes up a part of it. It is one draught of the cup, which the LORD hath ordained for me; a portion of the afflictions, which I am to paſs through, for His CHRIST's ſake, and cauſe. It's one of the conflicts, which I muſt endure, for the conſummating of my whole courſe. But it may not be omitted, that the word here uſed, and which we have rendred, <hi>I do fill up,</hi> is in the Original very emphatical; and ſignifies, not ſimply to <hi>fill up,</hi> or to finiſh, but to fill up in ones turn, in conſequence of, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50919:65"/>with, ſome other. I reckon, that there is repreſented by it, a ſecret oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, between what JESUS CHRIST had ſuffered, for the Apoſtle, and what the Apoſtle at that time was ſuffering for JESUS CHRIST. The LORD (ſaith he) hath, in his rank, compleated all the ſufferings, that were neceſſary for my redemption: I now, in my turn, fill up all the afflictions, that are uſeful for His glory. He did the work, which the Father had given Him to do on earth; and I after Him, and after His example, do that, which He hath charged me with. He hath ſuffered for me; I ſuffer for Him. He hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſalvation, by His croſs: I advance His Kingdom, by my combats. His blood hath redeemed the Church; my impriſonment, and my bonds do edify it. For you ſee, My Brethren, that the conformity, which is between JESUS CHRIST, and each one of the faithful, doth require, that there be ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between His ſufferings, and ours. And this is that, which the Apoſtle intends, by the word here uſed. Hitherto we muſt alſo referr, his ſaying particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, <hi>that he fills up the remainder of the afflictions of CHRIST, in his fleſh.</hi> For as the LORD did ſuffer in this infirm, and mortal nature, which He had put on; and, after He had put off the infirmneſs of it, and rendered it immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and impaſſible, ſuffered no more: in like manner, it's in this fleſh, that all the afflictions ſhall be filled up, which we are to ſuffer, by the order, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of GOD. When we ſhall have once quitted it, there will be no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, and ſufferings for us to undergo, then there were, for the LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, after His death upon the croſs. It's this ſame thing, the Apoſtle ſignifies, in the paſſages before alledged; that he beareth the dying of CHRIST, in His body; and His brandings in His fleſh. Whence appears, (to note it by the way) how abſurd the belief of Purgatory is; which makes the faithful to ſuffer, not in the fleſh; but in the Spirit; and extendeth their afflictions, and pains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yon the days of their fleſh; in which nevertheleſs, the Apoſtle teacheth us, that their ſufferings are compleated. Thus you ſee, what the ſenſe of his words is, and how much reaſon he had, to rejoyce in his ſufferings: Firſt, becauſe they were the afflictions of JESUS CHRIST, the Prince of life, and the author of our ſalvation. Secondly, Becauſe they were diſpenſed, by the order, and the will of GOD. Thirdly, becauſe they made up, the laſt part of the Apoſtles task; being the going on, and the remainder of the conflicts, which he had to ſuſtain. And laſtly, becauſe they contained an illuſtrious evidence of his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards the LORD; and rendered him conform to His holy image, in that, as JESUS had ſuffered for his ſalvation, he alſo ſuffered, in his order, for the glory of his gracious Maſter.</p>
                     <p>But he addeth, yet another reaſon, that ſweetned likewiſe the bitterneſs of his ſufferings to him, and made him to find joy amid the horror of them: It is, that he ſuffered them, for the body of the LORD, which is His Church. He had already ſaid, that he ſuffered for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> as we have explained it; Now he extendeth, the fruit of his afflictions, further, ſaying, that they are of uſe, to the whole Church. And to ſhew us, how much weight, this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould have, to make his ſufferings pleaſant to him, he gives the Church the higheſt, and the moſt glorious appellation, that can be attributed to any creatures, calling it the body of CHRIST. For what more illuſtrious, and more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubject can we ſuffer for, than the body of the Son of GOD, the King of ages, the Father of eternity? We have already treated of it at another time, upon the eighteenth verſe of this Chapter; and ſhewed, how, and in what ſenſe, the Church is the body of CHRIST; neither will we repeat ought of it, for the preſent. But his affirming, that he fills up theſe afflictions, for the Church, is true, and appeareth ſo to be, in two reſpects. Firſt, inaſmuch as the Church was the occaſion, and indeed the cauſe of his ſufferings. For it was the ſervice he did it, in preaching the Goſpel, in inſtructing, and comforting it, in founding it, and ſetling it in the faith, that had provoked the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved him in the afflictions, which did beſet him. As if a Princes ſervant, zealous for his Maſters glory, and for the weal of his affairs, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through fall into ſome diſaſter; he might ſay it was for him, and his Eſtate,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50919:65"/>that he ſhed his blood, and lay a priſoner in his enemies hands. Secondly, S. <hi>Pauls</hi> afflictions were for the Church, becauſe he ſuffered them, for the edification, and conſolation of the Church. This was the ſcope of his patience, and the deſign of His conſtancy. It's to the Church, that all the fruit, of theſe fair, and illuſtrious examples of the Apoſtles vertue, did redound. He himſelf explains it to be thus, elſewhere. If we be afflicted (ſaith he to the faithful) it is for your conſolation, and ſalvation; which is effected in enduring the ſame afflictions, which we alſo ſuffer; where you ſee, that the fruit, which the faithful reaped from theſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, conſiſted in this; that by the vertue of his example, they were confirmed in the Goſpel; were rejoyced, and comforted, and fortified for the like combats. And in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> treating of the ſame bond,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.12 13, 14.</note> that he ſpeaks of in this place, I would, ye ſhould know, (ſaith he) that the things which have beti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me, have fallen out rather to the greater furtherance of the Goſpel. So that my bonds in CHRIST have been noted in all the Palace, and in all other places. And many of the brethren in the LORD, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to ſpeak the word without fear. Lo! how his ſufferings were for the Church, in that they encouraged the Preachers; and enkindled, in the hearts of the faithful people, the zeal of the houſe of GOD, and in thoſe without, an inquiſitiveneſs about the Goſpel, for which he was a priſoner. This great man's preaching had never ſparkled, as it did; it had never afforded the world, and the Church, ſo much edification, and conſolation, if it had not been accompanied with ſufferings, ſealed with his blood, and confirmed by his wonderful patience amid the continual perſecutions that were raiſed againſt him. The conflicts of other ſervants of GOD, have the ſame effect. Their blood is the ſeed of the Church. It's from their ſufferings, that it ſpringeth up. It's by them that it groweth, and gathereth ſtrength. It's the patience of theſe Divine Warriours, that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the world, that conquered the nations unto JESUS CHRIST, and planted His croſs, and His Goſpel every where, even in the moſt rebellious ſpirits. Surely, ſince the Church received ſo much profit, from the Apoſtles afflictions, it's with good reaſon he affirms here, that he filleth up the remainder of them, for it. And in this ſence we muſt underſtand it, when he ſaith elſewhere,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> 
                        <hi>that he ſuffereth all things for the elects ſake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may ſuffice, for the propoſal of the truth, which is perſpicuous, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and obvious. But the Error of our adverſaries compelleth us to lengthen this diſcourſe; Not that they deny the expoſition, which we have produced; For how could they do that, without renouncing the doctrine of the Goſpel, and the confeſſion of Chriſtians in all ages? But granting, that the Apoſtles afflictions were for the Church, in the ſenſe we have expounded it, they add, that they were ſo further, in another ſenſe; that is to ſay, in that by undergoing them, he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for the ſins of other believers, and by this means did contribute to the greatning, and enriching of the Churches treaſury of ſatisfactions; out of which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom the cuſtody of it is committed, makes largeſs from time to time, as he judgeth meet, for the expiating of the ſins of penitents; and hence hath riſen the uſe of indulgences, which is become ſo common in our dayes. But firſt, what kind of proof is this? To ſhew, that the Saints have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Divine juſtice, for the ſins of other believers, they alledge, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, <hi>I fill up the reſt of the afflictions of CHRIST, for His Church.</hi> I anſwer, his meaning is, for edifying, and comforting of the Church. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, what I anſwer; and only add, that the Apoſtles ſufferings do ſerve alſo for the expiating the ſins of the Church, and to fill the exchequer of its pretended ſatisfactions. In conſcience, is this diſputing? Is it not a pronouncing of dictates, after their own phantaſie? Is not this a preſuppoſing of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and no proving it? It is clear, that we read nothing in this text, either of theſe ſatisfactions, or of that treaſury, or of thoſe indulgences, whereof they tell us. Certainly, if they will draw theſe things from hence, it behoveth them to ſhew us, that they are here; to diſcover them to us; to conſtrain us, by the force of their proofs, to ſee it here. But ſo far are they from binding us to this, that they not ſo much as endeavour to do it: and content themſelves with telling
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50919:66"/>us, that though our expoſition be good, and true, yet theirs alſo muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. Since they urge no other reaſon of it, but their own dictate, we may reject it, with the ſame facility, that they offer it. Nevertheleſs for your greater edification, I will inſiſt a little further, upon the illuſtration of this Text. Firſt, the Apoſtles words do no way oblige us, to underſtand him of their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it being evident, that it may be ſaid of all uſeful things, that they are for thoſe, who have the uſe of them: as for example, that it is for men the Sun ſhineth in the heavens; that it is for them, the clouds poure down the rain, and the earth yieldeth its fruits; That it is for the Church, S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtles; that for the ſame he preached, and publiſhed the Goſpel, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other ſuch things:
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.15.</note> in which, never any man dreamt of any ſatisfaction. And when S. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he would moſt willingly ſpend,
<note place="margin">Juſtinian on the place.</note> and be ſpent for them, doth he mean for the ſatisfaction of their ſins? No, ſaith a <hi>Jeſuite;</hi> but he ſpeaks, of his great pains, in preaching, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which would not have failed of being very uſeful to the edification of the Church, though of no value for the ſatisfaction of GOD; Here therefore in the ſame manner, when the Apoſtle ſaith his afflictions are for the Church. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows clearly that his ſufferings were of uſe to the Church, (which I willingly confeſs); but not, that they were ſatisfactions, for the ſins of the Church; which is preciſely the thing, we deny, and which they ſhould prove. But if the words of this Text do not found their expoſition; the authority of the Fathers, of which they are wont to make ſo great a noiſe, doth not eſtabliſh it any jot more: there being not known any one of them, that ever inferred their doctrine from the Text, or that interprets it otherwiſe, than we have done. Laſtly, the thing it ſelf doth as little favour their deſign. And to demoſtrate it to you, we muſt briefly touch at all the points of their pretended myſtery. It is compoſed of four propoſitions, all which they advance, upon their own credit, without found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo much as one of them on Scripture. For firſt, they preſuppoſe, that when GOD pardoneth us the ſins, that are committed after Baptiſm, He remitteth to us only the fault, and the eternal puniſhment: but not the temporal puniſhment of our treſpaſſes: this, they count, He obligeth us to expiate, either here, or in Purgatory. Secondly, they add, that divers Saints, as the Apoſtles, and the Martyrs, and others have done, and ſuffered much more, than themſelves needed, for the expiating of their own ſins. And as they are provident thrifty men, leſt theſe ſuperfluous ſatisfactions, (for ſo they call them) be unprofitably loſt, they hold, that they go into the Churches common treaſury; where being mixed with the ſuperabundant paſſions of CHRIST, they are conſerved for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of penetents. And finally, after all the reſt, they give the cuſtody of this treaſury, to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> alone, who diſpenſeth it, as he judgeth expedient. Here's a chain of immaginations, which have no foundation, either in reaſon, or in Scripture, or any other where, but in their own paſſion, and intereſt. For firſt, who taught them, to cut in pieces thus the benefits of GOD? and to ſuppoſe, that He remits the guilt, without the puniſhment; as if to remit a ſin, were ought elſe, than not to puniſh it? and that He, again, remits a part of the puniſhment, (to wit, the eternal) and holds us bound, to ſatisfie for the other? How doth this accord, with that full, and entire grace, which He promiſeth to repenting ſinners; and how with His declaring, <hi>that He will forget their ſins; that He will do away their iniquities; that He will remember them no more; and that there is no condemnation to them that are in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST?</hi> Would not it be a mocking of men, if after all this, He ſhould exact of them, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their faults, to the utmoſt farthing? And as for the pretended ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of the Saints, whence have they drawn them? from what Prophets, from what Apoſtles, ſeeing, both the one, and the others, do declare, that none of them were juſtified, by their doings, or their ſufferings? that they all had need of grace, for the expiation of their ſins? So far were they from having ſuffered more, than was neceſſary to expiate them: and that all their ſufferings are not able, to counterpoiſe the glory, wherewith GOD will crown them? And if we be indebted unto them, for any part of the expiation of our ſins; what will
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50919:66"/>become of the Apoſtles aſſertion, <hi>that CHRST purged our ſins by Himſelf?</hi>

If S. <hi>Paul</hi> who is in queſtion, did in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſatisfie for us, how doth he proteſt elſewhere, that He was not crucified for us? Sure, according to our adverſaries ſuppoſition,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.13.</note> he could not in truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it. For if his ſufferings do ſerve, not only to the edification of our lives, but alſo to the ſatisfying for our ſins, as they pretend; there remains no longer any ſenſe, in which it may be ſaid, that CHRIST alone did ſuffer for us. Theſe two propoſitions, that the Apoſtle did ſuffer, and did not ſuffer for us, will be irreconcilable; whereas in our doctrine, it is eaſie to accord them, by ſaying, he ſuffered for us, that is, for our edification, and ſuffered not for us, that is, not to ſatisfie for our ſins; this kind of ſuffering appertaining to the LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS only. Beſide, if the afflictions, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of here, were ſatisfactory for the Church, (as our adverſaries will have it) S. <hi>Paul</hi> would not have ſuffered them with joy: it being evident, that pains of this nature do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſeize thoſe, that ſuffer them, with an extream horror and heavineſs: becauſe they are accompanied, with the apprehenſion of the wrath of GOD againſt ſin; as it appears, both by the Croſs of our LORD, which he bore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and patiently, it is true; but without any moving of joy; and alſo by the confeſſion of our adverſaries themſelves, who repreſent to us the ſouls, that ſuffer for their ſins, in their imaginary Purgatory, all aſtonied with horror, and full of an exceſſive ſadneſs. In fine, how doth this fixtion accord, with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual voice of the Church, that though the faithful dye for their brethren,

This founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being overturned, their pretended treaſury, and the diſpenſing of it, which they forge, doth fall to ground.

As your cauſe is the ſame; ſo let your courage be like his. Conclude, as he did, that theſe bonds are an honour to you; that theſe ſufferings, are the afflictions of CHRIT. Let this ſacred Name, and the communion, you have with Him, ſweeten all the bitterneſs of your troubles. But Faithful Brethren, think ye not to be exempted from theſe trials, becauſe you are not Miniſters of the Goſpel. You alſo have part in them, each one according to his calling, and the meaſure of the grace of GOD. He hath no children, whom he conſecrateth not by afflictions. But if you ſuffer with JESUS CHRIST, you ſhall raign with Him, If you have part now in his Croſs, you ſhall have ſo one day in His glory. And to aſſure you of it, He calleth your ſufferings, His afflictions. He proteſteth, that you receive never a blow, but He feeleth it. Doubt not, but he doth take great notice of the confflicts, which He vouchſafes to call His. Think alſo upon what He hath ſuſtained for you, and you will confeſs, it is reaſonable, that you ſhould ſuffer ſomething for His Glory, who hath undergone ſo much for your ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He hath taken up for you, the whole curſe of GOD: Will not you bear the reproaches, and wrongs of men, for Him? He hath born and expiated the penalty of your ſins on the croſs. Will you have horror at the remainder of His afflictions. He hath accompliſhed, what was moſt difficult, that which none but He could diſcharge, having drank for us, the dreadful cup of GOD's indignation againſt our ſins. Accompliſh ye ſtoutly, the trials that remain for us. It's He Himſelf, that diſpenſeth them to us. It's not either the phancy of men, or the rage of Devils. God hath cut out our task for us. It's from His hand we muſt receive, all the afflictions, we ſhall ſuffer. But beſide that we owe this reſpect, and ſubjection, to GOD; let us learn of the Apoſtle, that we owe ſuch examples alſo to the Church. It is not for JESUS CHRIST alone, that we ſuffer. It is for His body alſo. As our afflictions advance the glory of the Maſter; ſo do they ſerve likewiſe, for the edification of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Judge ye thereby, Faithful Brethren, what our affection for the Church ſhould be. The conſideration of it made up a good part of the Apoſtles joy. He accounted himſelf happy, that by his ſufferings, he could teſtify the love he bore, to this ſacred body of His Maſter. He bleſſed his Chain, how hard ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, becauſe it did the Church ſome ſervice. Dear Brethren, let us imitate this divine charity. Love we our LORD's Church above all things. Let us make it the chief object of our delight. Conſecrate we to its edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all the actions, and ſufferings of our lives. Embrace we all its members, with brotherly kindneſs; and take good heed, we deſpiſe no man, that hath the honour to be incorporate in ſo auguſt, and ſo divine a ſociety. The Apoſtles example ſheweth us, that we owe them even our blood, and our life. And we have heard him beſides at another time,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.17.</note> profeſſing to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that if he might ſerve for an aſperſion upon the ſacrifice,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.16.</note> and ſervice of their faith, he ſhould joy in it. And S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>that as CHRIST hath laid down His life for us, ſo we ought to lay down our lives, for our brethren.</hi> If the LORD ſpare our infirmity, and call us not, to ſo high trials; let us, at leaſt, teſtifie our charity towards the Church, by all the offices, and ſervices, whereof our condition, and the preſent occaſion is capable. We owe it our blood. Let us give it, at leaſt, our tears, our almes, our good examples. You that have had the heart, to plunge your ſelves, in the vain paſtimes of the world, while the Church was in mourning; that have laught, and ſported, while ſhe ſuffered, and groaned; repair this diſorder. Comfort her with your pious tears, whom you have ſadded, by your vain pleaſures. Break with the world. Have no more commerce, but with the children of GOD. Remember, you have the honour, to be the body of JESUS CHRIST. How is it, that you have no horrour, at defiling, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures of ſin, and vanity, thoſe members, which are conſecrated to the Son of GOD, waſhed with His blood, ſanctified by His word, and baptized with His Spirit. The Church, beſide this purity of life, which its edification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50919:68"/>of you, at all times; doth particularly at the preſent, demand of you the ſuccour of your alms, for the refreſhment of its poor members. Their number, and their neceſſity, encreaſeth daily. Let your charity be augmented, after the ſame proportion. Let it relieve the indigence of ſome, let it allay the paſſions of others; let it extinguiſh enmities, and hatred, among us all. Let it ſeek not only to thoſe, whom you have wronged; but even to them, that have offended you, without cauſe; that henceforth you may truly be, the body of the LORD, His Church, holy, and unblamable, having no ſpot, nor wrinkle, nor any ſuch thing: patient, and generous in affliction; humble and modeſt in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; crowned with good works, and the fruits of righteouſneſs, to the glory of our great Saviour, the edification of men, and your own ſalvation. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>THE Church of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, is the faireſt, and moſt glorious State, that ever exiſted in the world; a State, formed in the counſel of GOD, before the creation of the heavens; founded on the croſs of His Son, in the fulneſs of time; governed by the Father of eternity; enlivened by His Spirit; the moſt prized, of His Jewels; the laſt end of His works, and the only ſcope of all His marvels. It's a State, not mortal, and corruptible, as thoſe of the earth; but firm and everlaſting; ſituate above the Sun, and Moon; and ſee all other things roul under its feet, in continual change, without being ſubject to their vanity. It's the only ſociety, againſt which, neither the gates of hell, nor the revolutions of time, ſhall at all prevail. It is the Houſe of the living GOD, the Temple of His holineſs, the Pillar of His truth, the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place of His grace, and glory. Whence it comes, that one of the Prophets long ago, contemplating it in ſpirit, cried out tranſported, and in extaſy. <hi>Honourable are the things,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 87.3.</note> 
                        <hi>that are ſpoken of thee, O City of GOD.</hi> But among its other glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, this in my opinion, is none of the leaſt, that GOD would employ the hands, the ſweat, and the blood of His Apoſtles, for the erecting of it. It is for the Church, that He made, and formed theſe great men. It's for the ſame, that He poured, into their ſouls, all the riches of Heaven. And as they had received them, for the Churches ſervice; ſo they laid them out faithfully, and cheerfully in it; yea, to ſuch a degree, that they counted it a great honour, to ſuffer on its oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. They bleſſed the reproaches, that they received, for edifying of it. We lately heard S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the moſt excellent of thoſe divine men, proteſting, that he <hi>rejoyced in his ſufferings, and afflictions for the Church;</hi> and now, in the Text we have read, he goeth on, and ſaith that he is the Miniſter of the Church. What, and how admirable muſt that happy Republique be, whoſe Miniſter, and ſervitor S. <hi>Paul</hi> was, the greateſt of men; one of the maſter-pieces of Heaven, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the earth? But beſide his deſigning to juſtifie, by theſe words, the joy he had in ſuffering for the Church, as Miniſter of it; He would alſo, found the liberty he took, to make remonſtrances to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and authorize his doctrine againſt the errors, which Seducers were ſowing among them. For this cauſe, he enlargeth on this matter, and magnifieth his Miniſtry. Firſt, he repreſents unto
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50919:69"/>them, the foundation of it; namely the Call of GOD; and the object of it, that is, thoſe, towards he ought to exerciſe it; and the end of it, in verſe 25. in theſe words, <hi>I have been made a Miniſter of the Church, according to the diſpenſation of GOD, which hath been given me towards you, to fullfil the word of GOD.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, in the following verſe, he extolleth the ſubject, about which the labour of this miniſtry was to be, to wit, the word of GOD; ſaying, <hi>that it is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which had been hid from all ages and generations, but which hath now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>been manifeſted to the Saints.</hi> Laſtly, he addeth in the laſt verſe, the efficacy of this Divine ſecret towards the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and declareth in one, wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, namely, <hi>in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST our LORD;</hi> He is the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſubſtance of this great myſtery. <hi>GOD</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>would give the Saints to know, what are the riches of the glory of this myſtery among the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>which is CHRIST in you the hope of Glory.</hi> Theſe are the three points, which we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to handle in this action, if the LORD permit, the miniſtry of <hi>Paul,</hi> the myſtery of the Goſpel, and the riches of its glory towards the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is great, the time ſhort, and our abilities ſmall; May it pleaſe GOD, to ſupply our defects, by the abundance of His Spirit; ſo powerfully ſtrengthning, and multiplying, the words of our mouth, in your hearts, that notwithſtanding their ſcantineſs, and poverty, they may yet adminiſter food for your ſouls; even as ſometime, by the vertue of His bleſſing, <hi>ſeven loaves, and a few little fiſhes,</hi> as you heard not long ago, ſufficed to ſatiate a great multitude.</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt of theſe three points; the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Church, doth ſay, <hi>Of which I have been made a Miniſter according to the diſpenſation of GOD, which hath been given me towards you, to fullfil the word of GOD.</hi> Upon which, we have four things to conſider. Firſt, the quality of the Apoſtles office, which he termeth, the miniſtry of the Church. Secondly, the the title to this office, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the diſpenſation GOD had given him. Thirdly, the object of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this office, which he expreſſeth, by ſaying towards you; that is, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew anon, and in the Fourth place, the function, and the proximate end of this office, which he declareth to us, in thoſe words, to fullfil the word of GOD. Obſerve then Brethren, firſt of all, how this holy Apoſtle, to expreſs the office, to which GOD had called him, ſaith, he had been made, not the Maſter, or the Prince, or the Judge, or the Monarch, or the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, but the Miniſter of the Church. Whereby you ſee, on the one hand, how very farr, from the mind of this holy man, the doctrine, and practiſe of thoſe is, who qualifie themſelves, with thoſe vain, and haughty titles; which are not heard of in the Scriptures, among the names of the Apoſtles, and Paſtors there: and who are not aſhamed to ſay, and to write openly; that Biſhops are Judges, Maſters, and Princes of their flocks: That he of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular, is the Monarch of the Church; its King, and its Soveraign Lord on earth; whoſe feet it ought to kiſs, the loweſt homage a vaſſal can do to his Maſter; that he hath power to impoſe laws on the Church, which ſhall bind the Conſcience, ſo as it can have no faith, or ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of his obedience; that he hath, though indirectly, even power, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the temporalities of the Church; not ſo much as the Scepters, and Crowns of the Soveraign powers of the earth excepted. Judge by this, if it be not a mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world, to ſtrive that they may be taken for true heirs, and ſucceſſors of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>Peter.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth himſelf a Miniſter of the Church; Theſe men ſay, they are the Lords, and Monarchs of it. S. <hi>Paul</hi> proteſteth, that he hath no dominion over our faith. Theſe men pretend, that they have an abſolute empire;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 124.</note> ſuch, as every man is bound under pain of damnation, to believe all that they command, for this very reaſon, becauſe they command it. <hi>S.</hi>

S. <hi>Peter</hi> ordereth the Paſtors to feed the flock of CHRIST, not as having Lordſhip over his heritages: And theſe men attribute to themſelves a direct, and a ſupream dominion over them. In ſine, JESUS CHRIST, both <hi>Paul</hi>'s and <hi>Peter</hi>'s Maſter, ſaith expreſly to His Miniſters;
<note place="margin">Mat. 20.25.</note> 
                        <hi>You know, that the Princes of the Nations are Maſters over them, and exerciſe authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but it ſhall not be ſo among you.</hi> And theſe men exerciſe, both upon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50919:70"/>and Paſtors; in ſum, on the whole Church, a maſterſhip, and a dominion, much more abſolute, more rough, and rigorous, than ever did any Monarch upon his ſubjects; and ſuch, as wanteth neither the pomp of dignity, nor the ſplendor of riches; nor arms, nor guards, nor any other of the ordinary, and viſible marks, and badges of a worldly royalty. But you have to obſerve here alſo, on the other hand; how falſe and unjuſt the deriſion is, which our adverſaries make, of the name of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; which Paſtors among us do aſſume; imputing in a manner, their modeſty to them, as a crime; and almoſt accuſing them, that they are not arrogant. I know well, that the word here rendred, Miniſter, is often uſed, in the language of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Church, to ſignifie the miniſtry of thoſe; who have the care of the poor, and of the ſtock of the Church, and we have reteined it, in this ſenſe, in our vulgar tongues; in which, they that are put into ſuch charges, are called (in French) <hi>Diacres,</hi> (in Engliſh, Deacons) as you know; which is preciſely the Greek word, here uſed by the Apoſtle. But however, ſince S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath not ſtuck to uſe this name,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.23. 2 Cor. 3.6. &amp; 6.4.</note> for the expreſſing of his office, calling himſelf here, as you ſee, <hi>a Miniſter of the Church,</hi> and before, <hi>a Miniſter of the Goſpel,</hi> and elſewhere yet, <hi>a Miniſter of the new Teſtament,</hi> and again in another place, <hi>a Miniſter of GOD, and Miniſter of CHRIST;</hi> it ſeems to me, that no one can blame us, for having followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his humility; us, who are ſo far beneath him; and that the taxing of us, for calling our Paſtors, Miniſters, is evidently a reviling this great Apoſtle, who hath ſo often uſed this name, in this ſenſe, yea, even to ſignifie the higheſt dignities that be in the Church; ſuch as, without contradiction, his Apoſtleſhip was. For it is evident, that he meaneth this here, when he ſaith, <hi>he was made a Miniſter of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He adds, in the ſecond place, <hi>According to the diſpenſation of GOD which hath been given me.</hi> Hereby he ſheweth, firſt, that it was not man, but GOD, the ſupream Maſter, and Lord of the whole univerſe, who called and conſecrated him, to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. You all know the hiſtory of it, it being told us at length, in the book of the <hi>Acts:</hi> it is full of ſo many wonders, that the vocation of this holy man, ought to be counted very ſingular; many circumſtances meeting in it, which do not occur, in the call of any other Apoſtle. JESUS CHRIST had called the reſt, during the dayes of His fleſh; He called S. <hi>Paul,</hi> after His reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and His ſitting at the right hand of the Father. He converſed with the reſt on earth; To this perſon, He ſpake from Heaven. The others were invited by our Saviour, and won, by little, and little. Him He overcame, and ſubdued, at once, by an extraordinary exerciſing of His Divine power; ſeizing him ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the miraculous force of His right hand. If the reſt, before their call, had no affection for the LORD, at leaſt they had no hatred, nor averſion for Him. <hi>Paul</hi> burned with a furious zeal, againſt JESUS CHRIST, and all His, and made warr upon Him, and had weapon in hand, when he was plucked by coeleſtial power, out of the bonds of iniquity; and in a moment changed, from a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to a Miniſter of the Church. But beſide the Author of his call, he further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to us here, the nature of his Miniſtry, by ſaying, that this diſpenſation of GOD was given him. I am not ignorant, that the diſpenſation of GOD, may be taken, for the conduct, and wiſe diſpoſel of the Providence of GOD, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth all things, and particularly the things of the Church, by His eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. And if the Apoſtle had ſaid ſimply, that he had been made a Miniſter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to, or by, the diſpenſation of GOD, it might have been ſo underſtood; But he addeth expreſly, that this diſpenſation of GOD, was given him; and this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily obligeth us to underſtand it, not of the LORD's conduct, which was not given him; but of the divine office of a ſteward in His Church, to which S. <hi>Paul</hi> was called, and which was commited to him; For that the quality, and condition of his Apoſtleſhip was ſuch,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1.</note> he teacheth us expreſly elſewhere. <hi>Let every one</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>account of us as Miniſters of CHRIST, and ſtewards of the myſteries of GOD.</hi> Whence it clearly follows, ſince the Apoſtle was a ſteward, or a diſpenſer, that his Office was a ſtewardſhip, or a diſpenſation, as he calleth it here. And from thence it appears again, how falſe the opinion of thoſe is, who attribute a Lordly, and abſolute authority, and a diſpotical power, to Miniſters of the Church, over the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50919:70"/>LORD's flocks. For the ſteward, or diſpenſer hath power, not to do any thing of his own head, and after his own phantaſy; but only to diſpenſe, what the Maſter hath given him; and preciſely in ſuch manner, as he hath preſcribed him. If he licenſe himſelf to do more, he exceedeth the bounds of his commiſſion; and all, that he doth, or ſaith, beyond them, is null, and of no force, nor doth it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige any one of the houſhold, to obey it.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle adjoyneth, in the third place, the object of his Miniſtry, that is, who they are, towards whom he ought to exerciſe it. This diſpenſation of GOD, hath been given me towards you, ſaith he. Theſe <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to whom he wrote, being <hi>Gentiles</hi> by birth, and extraction, he conſidereth them here, in that quality, and his meaning is, that it was for them, and others like them, that he had been called to this ſacred miniſtry; that is to ſay, in a word, for the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> It's true; an Apoſtleſhip was an univerſal charge, which extended generally to all men, of what nation, or condition ſoever, having the whole earth for its praecinct; according to that clauſe of the commiſſion, which the LORD gave His Apoſtles, when He ſent them; Go, and teach all nations. And that the Miniſtry of S.
<note place="margin">Mat. 28.29.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> was of the ſame condition, doth appear evidently, by his procedure, and by his writings; For he often preached the Goſpel to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as you may ſee in divers places of the book of the <hi>Acts;</hi> and he directed to them particularly, that excellent Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which remaineth in the Church to this day. But though the extent of His charge was ſuch originally, and by right; nevertheleſs, that He might exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it with more commodiouſneſs, and fruit, GOD aſſigned him peculiarly to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and would have him labour, particularly for them; as He gave him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs notice, when He directed His call from Heaven to him;
<note place="margin">Act. 26.17, 18.</note> I ſend thee (ſaith he) to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to open their eyes, that they may be turned from darkneſs to light. And afterwards, in purſuit of this heavenly order, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> by a voluntary Oeconomy, parted mankind in two; <hi>Peter,</hi> with the other Apoſtles, taking the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to preach to, that is to ſay, the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the uncircumciſion, that is the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as himſelf reports elſewhere. Which muſt be underſtood, of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exerciſe of their charges; it being otherwiſe not prohibited, either that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould undertake preaching to, and the converting of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> or <hi>Paul</hi> the like for the <hi>Jews;</hi> if any opportunity inviting them to it, were at any time preſented them, in the courſe of their Miniſtry. Whereby you ſee, in general, how neceſſary this appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating of a determinate flock to each Paſtor, is; and how vain, and exorbitant, the pretention of Him is, who calls himſelf, the univerſal Paſtor, and Biſhop of all Chriſtendom. For if the Apoſtles themſelves, who had the power, did yet account the exerciſe of this charge ſo difficult, that to acquit them of it, they voluntarily parted the diſtrict of their commiſſion between them; each of them taking a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it only: how can we believe, that a man, who is infinitely inferior, in regard of the gifts of theſe great Miniſters of GOD, ſhould be capable to govern alone, the whole Church of CHRIST? But the Apoſtle alledgeth this, very pertinently, to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to keep them faſt in the purity of the faith. For ſince he had been ſent of GOD, to illuminate, and teach, the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> it is evident, that being <hi>Gentiles</hi> as they were, they owed him a particular reſpect, and were to receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into their belief, which was unconform to his inſtructions; conſidering him, as the Miniſter of their faith, whom GOD had particularly ſet over them. Whence it follows, that they neither could, nor ought to embrace that novel doctrine, which certain ſeducers did offer them; ſeeing it was neither preached, nor approved by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> And ſince we our ſelves are by extraction <hi>Gentiles,</hi> this conſideration, my Brethren, obligeth us alſo, to the ſame reverencing of this holy man. He is our Apoſtle, and the Miniſter, whom GOD hath given us, for an interpreter of His will, and a conductor of our ſouls to ſalvation. Let us reſpect Him, among all the Miniſters of CHRIST. Let us hear him diligently. Let us peruſe His divine inſtructions, night and day; let us abide fixedly hanging on His ſacred mouth, and not hear ought beſide. Whatever others may be, there was never any but he, that received from heaven, the particular commiſſion to inſtruct us.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, he ſheweth us, what the work is, and the end, of this Office of his; the diſpenſation of GOD hath been given me, towards you, (ſaith he) to fullfil the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50919:71"/>word of GOD. Some there be, that underſtand by this word of GOD, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, the ancient oracles, which foretold, the converting of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to the knowledge of the true GOD, in the days of the Meſſiah; as that, for inſtance,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 42.6. &amp; 49.6. Zech. 2.11. Mic. 4.1.</note> which we read in <hi>Iſaiah that CHRIST ſhall be a light to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and in <hi>Zechary, Many nations ſhall be joyned to the LORD, in that day, and ſhall become my people;</hi> and in <hi>Michah, Many nations ſhall go, and ſhall ſay, come and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and unto the houſe of the GOD of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in His paths.</hi> And other ſuch, which are found, in great number, in the books of the Prophets. As if the Apoſtle meant, that he was appointed the Miniſter of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for the accompliſhing of theſe predictions. Now ſure, it cannot be denied, but the thing in its ſelf, is true; it being clear, that his preaching was one of the moſt excellent means, which the LORD made uſe of, for the effecting of what he had promiſed, in thoſe oracles; namely, the converſion of the nations. Nevertheleſs, the putting of this ſenſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtles words, is in my opinion, a doing them ſome violence. For firſt, the word of GOD, in his ſtile, doth ſignifie the Goſpel; which is ſo called, by reaſon of its excellency: being, without controverſie, the moſt excellent of all the words of the LORD, and theſe terms are alwaies conſtantly ſo underſtood, when he coucheth them ſimply and abſolutely, as in this place he doth; and I do not think, that ſo much as one paſſage can be produced, wherein he takes them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies. And though this were not ſo; yet it is impoſſible, to underſtand them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe here; where the Apoſtle, to explain, what this word of GOD is, for the fullfilling whereof he was ſent, immediately addeth, the myſtery, which had been hidden from ages, and from generations; but hath now been manifeſted to His Saints; which is, as you ſee, an illuſtrious deſcription of the Goſpel. And as for this phraſe, of fullfilling the word of GOD, which ſeemeth chiefly to have ſetled the Authors of this expoſition, it ſounding harſh to them, that it ſhould ſignifie preaching of the Goſpel; they ſhould conſider, that the Apoſtle uſeth it elſewhere, in this very ſenſe;
<note place="margin">Rom. 15.19.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>that from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and round about, even to</hi> Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyricum, <hi>he had fullfilled the Goſpel of CHRIST;</hi> where he uſeth the ſame term, which he placeth here; and clearly calleth that, the Goſpel of CHRIST, which here he termeth the word of GOD. What doth he mean then, by theſe words? Truly, to fullfil the Goſpel, is to preach it, with ſuch efficacy, as that it hath reception in the hearts of men; it is, to juſtifie the vertue of it, by the effect. And therefore our <hi>French</hi> Bibles have judiciouſly rendred the word, in the place now quoted, by, <hi>making to abound.</hi> The true, and natural perfection of the Goſpel is, <hi>that it's the power of GOD to ſalvation, to every one that believeth, both</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Jew. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, it is ſo alwaies in its ſelf; but this its vertue doth not appear, nor diſplay it ſelf, until it be planted, by preaching, in the hearts of men; and do take root, and fructifie there. Till then its perfection remains hid, and wrapped up in its ſelf. 'Tis with it,, as with ſeed, which ſhews not what it is; but when having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the boſome of the earth, it produceth an herb, or a plant: or as a ſword in the ſheath, which doth not diſcover its ſtrength, and the goodneſs of its temper, but when it is drawn, and ſet on work. Thus doth the Apoſtle mean, when he ſaith, that GOD gave him the diſpenſation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to fullfil, or accompliſh his word. That is, to ſpread, and, by his preaching, diſplay the vertues, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of His Goſpel; which then clearly appeared, when this heavenly word, which till that time, had operated on the <hi>Jews</hi> alone in a manner, did alſo in ſhort ſpace convert, a great multitude of <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And the Apoſtle elſewhere, uſeth a like word, in almoſt the ſame manner, when he ſaith, that the power of GOD is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in infirmity, that is to ſay, not that it acquireth, but that therein it ſheweth and diſplayeth its perfection. Such is the end of the Apoſtles Miniſtry. He was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it, to fullfil, or compleat the word of GOD; to ſet His Goſpel on work; to preach it, for the converting of men, and for the glory of its Author.</p>
                     <p>Whereby you ſee, firſt, wherein principally, the charge of true Miniſters of the LORD, doth conſiſt; not incommanding, or in appearing above their flocks; much leſs in braving it before the world: but in publiſhing heavenly doctrine, with an holy order; even to the giving of themſelves no reſt, till it be ſetled in the ſouls
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50919:71"/>of their hearers; till it reign there, and ſhew its divine perfections in the change of their converſations. And ſecondly, that the Goſpel is the whole ſubject of their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo as they have not liberty, to mingle with it, either their own inventions, or traditions of men, how fair, and plauſible ſoever they may ſeem: that they do keep themſelves faithfully within theſe bounds, remembring the end of their commiſſion; that the diſpenſation of GOD hath been given them to fullfil the word, not of men, but of GOD. Conſider we now, that which the Apoſtle addeth, concerning this word of GOD, (that is, the Goſpel) <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the myſtery, which had been hid from ages, and from generations, but hath now been manifeſted to His Saints.</hi> All this ſerves, to exalt the glory of the Goſpel. He ſaith firſt, that it is a myſtery, that is, a ſecret; and he giveth it the ſame name often other-where;
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.16.</note> becauſe it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, not expoſed to the ſenſe, and reaſon of men, but ſecret, and hid in GOD: ſuch a doctrine, as eye ſaw not, nor ear heard, neither did it aſcend into the heart of man; Read the books of the worlds ſages. You will ſee, that by the ſubtility of their ſpirits, they did diſcover, and as we may ſay, read divers verities in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which the Creator had graven on them. But you ſhall not find thoſe of the Goſpel there at all. They were hid, in the deep abyſs of His eternal wiſdom and counſel, where no created eye can penetrate, or diſcern ought that is in it, untill Himſelf produce it, and ſet it in our ſight. Whereby it doth appear, how much they are miſtaken, who pretend, that Evangelical truth, may be found out, by the contemplation of nature. I grant, that the Goſpel doth not contradict nature; yea, I affirm, that it perfecteth, and crowneth it: ſo as when it is once revealed to us, we obſerve divers things in nature, which have admirable correſpondence with it, and could not be fully cleared, without this new light. But it is the Son of GOD alone, who brought it out of the boſome of the Father, and publiſhed it. By the ſame conſideration, you may alſo judge, with what reverence we ought to receive the Goſpel; ſince it is a myſterie, the ſecret, not of an earthly King; but of the Soveraign Monarch of Men, and Angels.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, in the ſecond place, that this ſecret <hi>had been hid from all ages and generations,</hi> that is, from the creation of the World, untill the revealing of our LORD, and Saviour; none of the former times, none of the generations of men, that lived in them, having had the happineſs to know it. There are many truths in the Law, that may be termed ſecrets, or myſteries: as for inſtance, what it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, concerning the creation of the world, and the manner of that Creation; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the judgement of GOD againſt ſin, and the calling of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been publick a long time, having been diſcovered, by the Miniſters of GOD,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Became publick long ago.</hi> Eph. 3.5.</note> to the ſore-paſſed generations. The Goſpel alone hath this glorious advantage, to have continued hidden, all that while, untill the appearance of the Son of God. S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms it here; He repeats it, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 16.25.</note> in almoſt the ſame terms. He had ſignified it before, in that, which he wrote to the <hi>Romans:</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>this myſterie had been kept ſecret in old time.</hi> But he adds in fine, that <hi>this great ſecret, hath now been manifeſted;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>in the fulneſs of time,</hi> in the latter days, when the Son of GOD appeared. By <hi>the Saints of GOD,</hi> he meaneth, firſt, the Apoſtles, to whom the LORD JESUS did diſcover the whole truth of His Goſpel, by the light of His Spirit, in a very peculiar, and extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and ſecondly, all the reſt of the faithful, whom he cauſed to ſee the ſame myſteries, by their Preaching, accompanied with the effectual operation, and light of the ſame Spirit. Both the one, and the other of them, are called Saints, becauſe GOD had ſeparated them, by His call from the reſt of men. By which you ſee, that there are none but the Saints of GOD, who do truly know His myſteries; the revelation, which is neceſſary for the knowing of them, moſt aſſuredly purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſanctifying the heart of man.</p>
                     <p>But I perceive, ſome difficulties ariſe here, in your minds, againſt this doctrine of the Apoſtle; which muſt be reſolved, for your ſatisfaction, before we paſs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on. Firſt, You may ask me in general, how it is true, that this myſterie was hid from the foregoing ages, ſeeing the Goſpel is eternal? And then, how this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth, with ſo many Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, in which it ſeems to be ſo clearly repreſented; and moreover, how with the LORD's ſaying of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:50919:72"/>that he ſaw His day; and laſtly, with the Scriptures expreſs informing us, that the ancient believers were all ſaved by faith, which ſeems to have no place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of the Goſpel? To this I anſwer, for the firſt article, that it is true, the Goſpel was foretold, and as the Apoſtle ſpeaks elſewhere, was promiſed, and figured, under the Old Teſtament; but it was not manifeſted. It was at that time in being; but lay hid in the boſome of the Father, and only wrap'd up in the Oracles, by which He promiſed it, and in the types, by which He figured it; ſo as it is nevertheleſs eternal; foraſmuch as in theſe latter times, it was, not made, and created of nothing; but only brought out of the obſcurities, and enveloppings, which untill then it had remained covered with. And as for the Prophecies, it's true, they are clear, ſince the Sun of righteouſneſs, ariſing in the horizon of the Church, hath there ſhed abroad His light: by the benefit thereof we eaſily read, what the finger of GOD hath written in them; But before this, while the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night did cover all things, it was impoſſible for the beſt ſight, to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate throughly the true meaning of them. As when it is broad day, we read di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and without difficulty, the ſame writing, wherein we ſee nothing but ſome ſtrokes, and a few letters confuſedly, during the dimneſs of the night. Would you know, what difference there is between theſe two ſeaſons? Turn to that Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.7.</note> in which we read, <hi>He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter,</hi> and what follows. There is not a child among us, but preſently underſtandeth it of CHRIST, and His dying for us,
<note place="margin">Act. 8.34.</note> in a profound humbleneſs, and charity. Yet the <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> who, without doubt, was very forward in the Schoole of the former people, doth confeſs that he underſtandeth nothing of it; and cannot tell, whether the Prophet does ſay this of himſelf, or of ſome other. Firſt, the accompliſhment of the things, which is the commentary upon prophecies, and the light of figures, hath made the ancient oracles and types clear to us; which by conſequent, remained obſcure, and inexplicable, untill that event. Secondly, the Law did further augment this obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: being then ſpread over theſe myſteries, as a thick veil, through which, how ſharp-ſighted ſoever men were, it was not poſſible for them to pierce. Whereas now, the righteouſneſs of GOD having been revealed to us without the Law, (as the Apoſtle ſaith) and this troubleſome Veil having been rent, and removed by JESUS CHRIST, we clearly behold the light of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s face, which indeed was of old, but could not be ſeen, as long as it abode covered with the Veil of the Law. And as for <hi>Abraham; he ſaw the day of the LORD, and rejoyced in it:</hi> that is to ſay, he knew, and believed, that CHRIST ſhould come, and ſave the world, and exalt the people of GOD unto a ſuper-eminent glory; which was ſufficient for his joy: but this implyeth not, that he diſtinctly knew, either what the perſon of CHRIST would be, or in what manner He acquired ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us, with all the circumſtances of theſe things; which neither any men, or ſo much as Angels knew, but by the manifeſtation of JESUS CHRIST, in fleſh,
<note place="margin">Eph. 3.10.</note> and by the conſequents thereof; the Apoſtle expreſly teſtifying, that it was then, and not before, that the manifold wiſdom of GOD was made know to the Angels; whom, according to his ordinary ſtile, he calleth, <hi>principalities and powers.</hi> The knowledge, which the reſt of the faithful had of CHRIST, was like that which <hi>Abraham</hi> had. They believed in ſum, His coming, and their redemption, and the reſtauration of all things by His means: and they deſired Him, and waited affectionately for Him, ſaluting His promiſes afar off. But they did not diſtinctly comprehend the myſterie, and in particular, as we at this day do. Yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not, but that they were juſtified by the merit of His death, and ſaved by His croſs, and fed with his Manna; and made to drink of His ſource; it being clear, that there is no other ſalvation in the world, but the ſame which He did procure; nor do the divers degrees of faith, by which the redeemed draw from His fulneſs, vary ought at all, in the eſſence, and ſubſtance of His grace: becauſe GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth no other faith of His people, but ſuch as is proportioned to the meaſure of the revelation, He hath given them; the ſame being more or leſs clear, as the times were nearer to, or further diſtant from, the glorious light of His Son. Thus the truth, which the Apoſtle teacheth us here, abideth firm, and beyond all contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; namely, <hi>that the myſterie of GOD,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the Goſpel, was hid from ages,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50919:72"/>and from all generations; and was not manifeſted, but now to the Saints of GOD. To whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>GOD would give to know, what are the riches of the glory of this ſecret, among the Gentiles, which is CHRIST in you, the hope of glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the third part of this Text, and doth expreſs the glory, and the ſum of this myſterie. He ſets the will of GOD, at the entrance, as a ſtrong barr againſt our curioſity, to ſtay it; and reſtrain it, from intruding into a ſearch of the cauſes, of this admirable diſpenſation of the myſterie of the Goſpel. It buſieth its ſelf principally about two points, namely, the time, and the perſons to whom this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation hath been made. For, as to the firſt, it doth demand, why GOD ſhould ſuffer ſo many ages to flow forth, and ſo many generations paſs away, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the ſecret of the Goſpel to them; having reſerved the revelation of it to theſe latter ages only? Let us ſay with the Apoſtle, that the truth is, He would ſo do; and be we contented with His will, aſſuring our ſelves, that it is juſt, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, though we know not, the motives of it. He hath reſerved the ſeaſons of things, in His own diſpoſe. Beſides, at what time ſoever He had done it, man would ſtill have demanded, why no ſooner, or no later. Now he complains, that GOD delayed ſo long. If GOD had diſcovered His myſterie, at the beginning, he would complain of His having made ſo much haſte. He now objecteth, the intereſt of the firſt ages, that were deprived of this bleſſed light. He would have object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the intereſt of theſe laſt generations, that they were too far removed from this Sun-ſhine, to make their profit of it. Unbelief doth never want pretences. It findeth ſomewhat to reply, againſt all the LORD's procedures. And not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, that they ſhould be juſt, doth eaſily forge apparences to it ſelf, to believe they are not ſo. Let us ſuffer Him to be wiſer than our ſelves; and inſtead of arguing about the order He hath taken, receive it with reſpect, and make our profit of it. Let it ſatisfie us, that by His grace, we find our ſelves, within the compaſs of that bleſſed time, in which He hath manifeſted His ſecret; and make we uſe, with thankfulneſs of the advantage, He hath pleaſed to give our age, above thoſe that have preceded. But if you ask me, why GOD communicated His Goſpel, to the Church no ſooner; tell me alſo, why He giveth not, to men, and other living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the perfection of their kind, at the inſtant of their nativity? why lets He them loſe ſo much time in the weakneſſes of infancy, which might be better employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in more noble actions, if they had their vigor, and maturity at the beginning of their days? Tell me again, why He maketh not the plants to grow up, to bloſſom, and to bear fruit, in a moment? and why He formeth families, and States ſo ſlowly, among mankind? GOD doth nothing ſuddainly; and would have us underſtand the maturity of His counſels, by the gravity of His motions. He hath formed the Church, in the ſame method. He would, that ſhe ſhould begin to pronounce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſpake diſtinctly; paſs through childhood, before coming to full age. He would, that ſhe ſhould learn her rudiments, before ſhe heard the higheſt leſſons of His wiſdom; And haue, in one of her times, <hi>Moſes</hi> for her School-maſter; in the other, JESUS CHRIST for her Doctor, as the Apoſtle ſheweth us, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> Since the Goſpel is the higheſt of Her leſſons,
<note place="margin">C. 3, &amp; 4.</note> it was juſtly reſerved for her ripeſt age. But if you preſs me ſtill, and ask me, why GOD ordained ſuch a difference between the ages of the Church: I will anſwer you, as before, with S. <hi>Paul:</hi> that thus He would do. You cannot break over this bound, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unſetling the whole nature, and bringing the juſtice, of all His progreſſes into conteſtation; it being evident, that it was neither more difficult for GOD, nor leſs apparently reaſonable to give animals, and vegetables, their ſtrength and perfection, in the firſt moments of their life; then to give the Church, the knowledge of His myſteries, in the firſt centuries of her time. The other point, in this diſpenſation of GOD, which offends our curioſity, reſpecteth the perſons, to whom He hath manifeſted His myſterie, and ſanctified them by this Divine light. Why to theſe, hath He done this, rather than to thoſe? Why to poor <hi>Galileans,</hi> rather than to the Scribes, and Prieſts of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> The Apoſtle cutteth the knots of all theſe queſtions, with one only word, ſaying, that <hi>He would make it known to them.</hi> It's the reaſon, which the LORD Himſelf alledged, for this diverſity, <hi>when having given thanks to the Father, for that He had hid theſe things from the wiſe, and prudent, and revealed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50919:73"/>them unto babes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 11.26.</note> He addeth, <hi>Even ſo, Father, for thus it hath pleaſed thee.</hi> And our Apoſtle treating elſewhere expreſly of this matter, concludeth, <hi>that GOD hath mercy on whom He will have mercy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 9.18.</note> 
                        <hi>and whom He will He hardeneth.</hi> It's at this Will, that we muſt ſtop, and not go on, vainly ſeeking for reaſons in the perſons themſelves, of the favour GOD hath ſhewed them; it being clear, that we ſhall never find in them any which may give us ſatisfaction. And again, hereto muſt we reduce all the diverſities, which may be obſerved in the diſpenſation of the Goſpel: as, that GOD maketh it to abound, in one country, and among one people, while another is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it; that He maketh it to ſhine upon one generation, after having denyed it to another; that He communicates it here more liberally, and there more ſparingly. All this dependeth meerly on His good pleaſure; nor can the things themſelves afford us any valuable reaſon of it.</p>
                     <p>But I return to the Apoſtle, who ſaith, <hi>that by the revelation of His Goſpel, GOD hath made known, what are the riches of the glory of this myſterie among the Gentiles.</hi> They that are verſed in the reading of this holy man's writings, do know that he often uſeth the word <hi>riches,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 11.33.</note> to ſet forth <hi>abundance.</hi> As when he cryeth out, <hi>Oh the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdom and the knowledge!</hi> and when he ſpeaketh elſewhere <hi>of the riches of the grace of the LORD;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.7. Rom. 2.4.</note> and when he demands of the impenitent, <hi>if he deſpiſe the riches of the goodneſs of GOD, of His patience and long-ſuffering;</hi> and ſo in a multitude of other places. It's in this ſenſe, that we muſt here underſtand the expreſſion of <hi>riches of glory;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>a great abundance of glory, or</hi> (which amounts to as much) <hi>a very great and moſt abundant glory.</hi> Whereby you ſee the zeal of this holy man for the praiſe of the Goſpel. Inaſmuch as he cannot ſatisfie himſelf about this ſubject, but heapeth up the moſt magnifick terms, he can think of, to repreſent the excellency of it. He calleth it a <hi>myſterie,</hi> and a <hi>myſterie of GOD;</hi> and a <hi>myſterie hidden,</hi> during all the ages that rolled on from the foundation of the world, and at length diſcovered from Heaven in the laſt time, to the Saints of GOD. This is very much; and there is no other doctrine, either humane, or indeed Divine, of which ſo much can be ſaid. But it is not enough for S. <hi>Paul.</hi> He adds, <hi>that it is a glorious myſterie,</hi> yea contents not himſelf with this. He aſcribes to it, not <hi>glory</hi> ſimply, but <hi>riches,</hi> and an abundance of glory. And it is not here alone, that he doth ſo. He ſpeaks of it every other-where in the ſame manner; as when he ſaith, <hi>that unto him this grace was given,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 3.7, 8.</note> 
                        <hi>to preach among the Gentiles, the unſearchable riches of CHRIST:</hi> and to make all men ſee, what is the communication of the myſterie, which from the beginning had been hid in GOD; and elſewhere he calls it, <hi>the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious miniſtration of the Spirit;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.8.18.</note> 
                        <hi>and the mirrour wherein the face of the LORD is openly beheld.</hi> And in truth, he had good reaſon. For it is particularly in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that GOD hath made all the beams of His glory to ſhine out. There He manifeſteth and communicateth unto men, all the marvels of His Power, of His Wiſdom, of His Juſtice, and of His merciful goodneſs, in their greateſt altitude, and in their richeſt abundance, which are as the ſubſtance and eſſence of this glory. The Goſpel is His treaſury, wherein He preſents us His moſt glorious, and His Divineſt benefits; His grace, His peace, His Spirit, His Holineſs, His conſolation, His life, and His immortality. But the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak here of the riches, of the glory of the Goſpel in general, and towards all. He addeth particularly <hi>among the Gentiles.</hi> Sure, there is no ſort of men, whether Jews or Greeks, but the Goſpel ſheweth forth riches of glory in them, if they receive it; Yet we muſt acknowledge, that never-did its glory break forth, with ſo much ſplendor, as when it was preached to the Gentiles. Firſt, that exceeding great and inexhauſtible abundance of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and grace, which the Goſpel goeth fill'd up with, did pour forth it ſelf, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) overflowed all bounds, in ſaving the Gentiles, the moſt hopeleſs of all men; when it raiſed them from this grave, or rather from that abyſs of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, wherein they had lain, not four dayes, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his Sepulchre, but for four thouſand years. For this cauſe, the holy Apoſtle, comparing the grace of GOD in His Son,
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Then again, how very admirable was the vertue of the Goſpel, which effected that in a few dayes, that the Law had not been able to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50919:73"/>do, in ſo many ages? The Miniſters of the Law did compaſs Sea, and Land, and after all found it very hard to make one proſelyte, and with all their diligence, for two thouſand years, that they toiled, had not reduced ſo much as one Nation to the Service of GOD, though they employed even ſword, and ſtrength to that end, when they could. But the Goſpel quite naked, and without other weapons, then its Croſs, brought unto GOD many a people converted from Paganiſm. They were a ſort of men, that worſhipped ſtocks and ſtones: they lay plunged in a bruitiſh ignorance, and in the moſt infamous vices; there was a mixture in them, of the ſtupidity of beaſts, and the wickedneſs of Devils. Certainly, to make ſo much as one of theſe a Chriſtian; to bring him out of this infernal pit,

It was truly therefore a great, and an ineffable richneſs, and abundance of glory, for the Goſpel, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſo ſpeedily, not a ſmall number, but hundreds, and thouſands of Pagans, into ſo many believers. And in this, the Apoſtle ſecretly ſtrikes at the falſe Teachers, who would mix ſuch a noble, and glorious myſtery, with their feeble traditions, as if it had not ſtrength, and vertue enough of it ſelf to ſubſiſt, without the ſuccour of their inventions.</p>
                     <p>Finally, he intimates, in two words, the ground of all this richneſs of glory, that the Goſpel hath; which is (ſaith he) CHRIST in you; that is to ſay, that CHRIST, whom they poſſeſſed, and who dwelt in them by faith.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.1.</note> And he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that He is the hope of glory; after the ſame manner, that elſewhere he calleth CHRIST our hope, that is, He of whom we hope for higheſt glory, and in whom we do infallibly find all the bleſſedneſs, that we can, either defire, or expect. It is not without deſign, that he advertiſeth them, that JESUS CHRIST is all the fullneſs of the myſtery of the Goſpel. He lays a foundation hereby, for what he will more clearly tell them hereafter: namely, that it is in vain, that the ſeducers would mingle, the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the ſervice of Angels with it. All this great myſtery begins, and ends in JESUS CHRIST; ſince it is no other thing,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.16.</note> as himſelf defineth it elſewhere, than GOD manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of Angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved up into Glory; that is, JESUS CHRIST our LORD, born, put to death, raiſed again, glorified, and ſet forth in the Goſpel for us. Such is the myſtery, whereof the holy Apoſtle hath ſpoken to us.</p>
                     <p>Judge now, Beloved Brethren, what grace GOD hath ſhewed us, in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſo rich, and ſo admirable a ſecret to us. Many Kings, and Prophets have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee, and hear it; and not at all had the happineſs. Heaven, and earth did ſigh four thouſand years, after the bleſſing we poſſeſs: But in the end, only the laſt ages did obtain it. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſaw the wonders of GOD but obſcurely, and through veils, and ſhadows. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſaw them not at all, being covered with a diſinal night, living without GOD, and without hope. This divine myſtery, appearing at once, in the end of times, as a great light, that ſhines forth ſudainly from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, did diſſipate the ſhadows of the one, and diſpel the darkneſs of the other, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by its vertue, the whole face of the univerſe in a moment. It hath particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed the riches of its glory among us, having brought our Fathers out of the horrours of Paganiſm, which did once cover this whole Land. Let us embrace therefore, with all the affections of our ſouls, this great and ineſtimable favour of the LORD's. Let us keep it pure, and uncorupted, without immixing in it, ought that's alien to it. It is not only ſufficient for our happineſs. It is even rich, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in glory. They, that would ſtuff it out with Ceremonies, and ſervices, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s teaching, or mans inventing, as falſe Teachers heretofore did, and our adverſaries at this day do; they, underſtand not aright the inexhauſtible opulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wherewith it overſlows. They obſcure the reſplendency of its heavenly glory, by their additions; they hide it, and cover it again, with the veil, which JESUS CHRIST hath rent in ſunder. Let us ſay to ſuch, as propoſe them unto us; We are contented with the myſtery, which GOD hath vouchſafed to manifeſt unto His
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50919:74"/>Saints. It ſufficed for their bliſs. It will well ſuffice for ours. We do not deſire, any other riches, than thoſe which it aboundeth with; or any other glory than that, which it ſhines withall. It is enough, that this JESUS CHRIST, who fills it up, is in us, the hope of true glory. There is no need to aſſociate with Him, either <hi>Moſes,</hi> or Angels, or Saints. But Faithful Brethren, the ſecuring of this myſtery, from the errors of ſuperſtition, is not all. For the converſing of it pure among us, and placing it in that glory, which is due to it, there muſt be a putting far away the filth of vices, and of carnal, and earthly paſſions. GOD hath not lighted up this great Sun among you, that ye ſhould continue to live ill, and do the ſame works, in ſuch a bleſſed light, as are done in darkneſs. Far be it from Him. He hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to you, the myſteries hidden in old time, that your holy life might be new. As your knowledge is greater, than that of other ages; ſo let your holineſs ſurpaſs theirs. The dimneſs of their light doth in ſome ſort excuſe their faults; faults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the miſtakes of childhood, and in the obſcurity of ſhadows. With what pretext can you palliate yours? you, to whom GOD hath communicated all His counſel; How will you defend, that ardent, and unruly paſſion, which you have for the earth? you, whom by the Goſpel, he hath made to ſee, all the beauties of Heaven; How will you juſtifie the love, and the adherence you have, one to the pleaſures of the fleſh, another to the heaps, and honours of the world? you, to whom He hath ſhewed the riches, and the glory of eternity, in His Son JESUS CHRIST? Sure, to ſin, in ſuch light, is not an infirmity; nor ſimply a naughtineſs. It is an impudence, and an execrable inſolency. Take heed then, Beloved Brethren, that this great grace, which GOD hath ſhewed you, do not turn to your condemnation. If you deſire, it ſhould be ſaving to you, purifie your ſelves, and cleanſe your ſelves from all filthineſs and pollution. For the myſteries of GOD are only for Saints. Renounce the world's behaviour, as well as its belief: Walk in the wayes of Heaven, in an Honeſty, and Purity, worthy of the vocation wherewith GOD hath honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you. Let His myſtery ſhew forth the wonders of its glory, among you; potent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changing your whole life, into its brightneſs, and transforming you into the image of that JESUS CHRIST, who hath vouchſafed to dwell in you, and to take your hearts, for His temple: that after you have wiſely managed His talents here below, and happily travailed in His work, He may crown you one day, in the Heavens, with that ſoveraign, and eternal glory, which He hath promiſed us, and we hope for, from His grace. So be it.</p>

                     <p>DEAR Brethren; There is a great difference between the Law, and the Goſpel, both in regard of their own nature, and in regard of the manner of their diſpenſation. For, to omit other things, the Goſpel is a myſtery, that is, a verity, ſo hid in GOD, as if He had not vouchſafed to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to men Himſelf, by a ſupernatural revelation, no creature, either earthly, or heavenly, had been ever able to bring it forth from the bottomleſs deeps of GOD's wiſdom; or to acquire any ſolid, and diſtinct knowledge of it, by the contemplation of the things of the world. But the Law is a verity, ſuitable to the ſentiments of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo open to the view of Angels, and men; that if ſin had not dulled, and corrupted the ſtrength of our underſtanding, we ſhould have eaſily comprehended it, of our ſelves, without any extraordinary manifeſtation from Heaven. Accordingly you ſee, how deplorate, and how blind ſoever men be, yet they fail not to diſcern the things of the Law, and the rectitude, and juſtice of the moſt of that, which it commands us. But if you conſider the diſpenſation of theſe two doctrines, you will find, that whereas the Law was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Jewiſh nation only, the Goſpel of our LORD and Saviour was preached to all people on earth indifferently, there having been no part of mankind, to whom the benefit of this new light was not preſented by the Apoſtles, and their Schollars. S. <hi>Paul</hi> (if you remember) inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us of it, in the foregoing text; where he affirmed, firſt, that the Goſpel is a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſudden during all the ages and generations, which had paſſed; but now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the Saints of GOD; and ſecondly, that the LORD hath made known the glorious riches of this myſtery among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that is to ſay, among other people of the world, beſide the <hi>Jews;</hi> This he further confirms, in the Text now read unto you, by the extent of his preaching, proteſting, that he declareth this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine word to all men. For having intimated before, the ſubject of this great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel, and declared that it conſiſteth wholy in CHRIST JESUS alone, who is the author, and the matter of this coeleſtial doctrine, he addeth, <hi>whom we preach, admoniſhing every man, and teaching every man in all wiſdom, that we may render every man perfect in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> And becauſe his labours, and his ſufferings, were one of the moſt glorious marks of the truth, and the Divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Apoſtleſhip, he maketh mention of them alſo, in the following verſe, <hi>Whereunto I alſo labour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>combating according to His efficacy, which worketh powerfully in me.</hi> For his deſign is to juſtifie, what he had before told the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> namely, that he was a Miniſter of the Church, ſet up to fullfil the word of GOD among the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and this, to the end he might eſtabliſh the <hi>Coloſſans</hi> in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50919:75"/>doctrine which he preached, and ſecure them from the ſeductions of falſe Apoſtles, who endeavoured to corrupt it, by immixing with it, the errors, which they went to and fro a ſowing in the world: and did pretend, that beſides Faith in JESUS CHRIST, there was a neceſſity of obſerving the ceremonies of the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and of practiſing divers ſuperſtitions, as the worſhipping of Angels, which they recommended, and hugely exalted, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> will ſhew us, in the following chapter. It was for the ſetting up of his own Miniſtry, and teachings, above theſe evil workers, that he urged his heavenly call before; It is for this end again, that he exalted the Goſpel, in ſo lofty a manner; and it's for the ſame end, that he here ſets forth the exerciſe of his Apoſtleſhip; which conſiſteth in two things; one whereof is the preaching, which he deſcribes in verſe 28. The other is the labour, and conflict, which accompanied his preaching, declared in the verſe following, the laſt of this chapter. Theſe are the two points, which we will treat of, by the will of GOD, in the preſent action; the Preaching, and the combats of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> noting upon each of them, what we ſhall judge apt for your edification, and conſolation; which is the only mark, that all the labour of this great Apoſtle tended to; and the true end, both of our word, and your faith.</p>
                     <p>As for the Apoſtles Preaching, we ſhall have four things to conſider, which he ſaith of it. Firſt, the ſubject of it, to wit, <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we preach.</hi> Secondly, the manner of it, which he expreſſeth in thoſe words; admoniſhing, and teaching every man. Thirdly, the object, to which this preaching of his was directed, namely, every man; <hi>admoniſhing every man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and teaching every man;</hi> and in the fourth, and laſt place, the end, and aim, to which it tended, to wit, the perfecting of thoſe, to whom it was directed; <hi>that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we may render every man perfect in CHRIST JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> For the firſt, when he ſaith, <hi>that he preacheth JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> his meaning is not ſimply, that he ſpeaks of JESUS CHRIST to thoſe, whom he inſtructed. There never was an heretick, but made ſome mention of Him; and for the colouring of his dreams, did mingle with them ſomewhat of the myſtery of JESUS CHRIST; even <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf, the deſperateſt of all impoſtours, that ever debauched men from the Goſpel, doth nevertheleſs ſpeak of Him with honour, and acknowledge in groſs, the truth of the call, and doctrine of JESUS. But the Apoſtle ſigni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ies, that he declareth JESUS CHRIST alone; preacheth none but Him; that He is the only ſubject of His preaching, and the filling up of his teachings; according to the profeſſion he expreſly maketh elſewhere, that he determined to know nothing among them,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2.</note> whom he taught, but JESUS CHRIST crucified. His Epiſtles, in which he hath left us a lively, and a true picture of his preaching, do ſufficiently juſtifie his ſpeech. For ſuch as have read thoſe divine writings ſee, that they are filled, from the beginning to the end, with JESUS CHRIST alone. This adorable name ſhines out every where in them; and there is no tract, or chapter, but it is engraven on it. There are ſcarce two periods found together, in which it doth not appear. If he be to teach, he propoſeth no other ſecrets, but thoſe of the nature, or the offices, or the actions, or the paſſions, or the promiſes of JESUS CHRIST. If he muſt combat error, he wields no other weapons in it, but the Croſs of JESUS CHRIST. If he aim to clear the obſcurities either of nature, or of the Law; JESUS CHRIST alone is the light he uſeth, to diſſipate all kind of ſhadows, and clouds. From Him he fetcheth conſolation, for ſouls caſt down, either by the ſenſe of their ſins, or by the heavineſs of affliction. In Him, he finds all his motives, and arguments for our ſanctification. JESUS CHRIST alone, furniſheth him, with all that's neceſſary to pacifie our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to make glad our hearts, to raiſe our hopes, to confirm our faith, to enflame our charity, to inkindle our zeal, to ſtiffen our conſtancy, to encourage our patience, to purifie our affections, to looſen us from the earth, and lift us up to heaven. JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST is all his Logick, and all his Rhetorick. He is the riſe of his arguments, the magazin of his arms, the great motive of his perſwaſions, the ſoul of all his diſcourſes. In the determinations of this holy Doctor, you no where meet with, either Pope; or Maſs; or devotions to Saints, and Angels; or Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or auricular confeſſions, or ſo much as one of thoſe pretended myſteries, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50919:75"/>fill up the modern Theology. He was fully content with JESUS CHRIST. He believed it enough, to preach Him, and that he needed no more, either to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his own duty, or to advance our edification; and truly he had reaſon. For what is there, I do not only ſay neceſſary, and uſeful, but any way good, or great, and excellent, which is not in JESUS CHRIST? Though other things, which are recommended in religion, were as true as they are falſe; and as innocent, as they are pernicious; yet it is evident, that in compariſon of CHRIST JESUS, they are miſerably poor, and childiſh. In Him alone is found ſuch true ſolidity, as is able to content the ſoul; in Him alone is wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption; all the fulneſs of the Godhead; all the treaſures of wiſdom, and knowledge, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> will tell us hereafter. In this LORD alone, is grace, truth, and life. There is no ſalvation in any other.
<note place="margin">Acts 4.12.</note> 
                        <hi>No other name hath been given under Heaven unto men, whereby they muſt be ſaved.</hi> And yet, alas! though this be a truth, ſo clear in it ſelf, and ſo authentically confirmed by the practice of our great Apoſtle; there are people, that profeſſing to believe it, do for all, ſeek that elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, which is to be found in JESUS CHRIST only: and having this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and overflowing ſpring of grace opened to all believers, by the loving kindneſs of the Father; yet go digging in the poor Ciſterns of the creatures, for the water of ſalvation. They acknowledge, that the merits of JESUS CHRIST are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, His righteouſneſs abſolutely perfect, His grace inexhauſtible, His power ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent: but they are not content with it however; They adjoyn their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto His; the prayers of Angels, and Saints to His interceſſion; and do min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the ſufferings of men, with the blood of the Son of GOD. But if the luſts of the world, or the falſe blaze of error, or the corrupt inclinations of the fleſh, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to approve, or to bear with ſo dangerous a mixture; let us, for our part, Dear Brethren, whom GOD hath delivered from ſuch prepoſſeſſions, adore the fulneſs of JESUS CHRIST. Let us content our ſelves with his richneſs, and never ſeek any true good any otherwhere, than in Him. Bleſs we GOD, that from the Pulpits erected among us, we hear no name ſounded forth but His. Since S. <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth none but Him, it is greateſt reaſon, that He alone ſhould take up the mouth of Preachers, and the faith of their hearers.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle having declared the ſubject of His preaching, addeth the matter of it. <hi>We preach CHRIST,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>admoniſhing, and teaching in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Theſe are the two parts of the office of a good Preacher, to wit, <hi>admonition,</hi> and <hi>inſtruction.</hi> The firſt compriſeth all the remonſtrances, that are made to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; whether to reprehend their faults, or to excite their diligence, or to comfort their ſorrows, or to advertiſe them of any other part of their duty. The ſecond, conteineth all the leſſons of heavenly doctrine, the expoſition of each of the articles of the myſtery of godlineſs. Admonition reformeth manners; teaching informs faith. The one moveth the will, and the affections; the other inſtructeth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. The Apoſtle proteſteth elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Act. 20.21, 31.</note> that he carefully joyned theſe two offices together; not contenting himſelf with teaching, and teſtifying of faith in JESUS CHRIST; but moreover inceſſantly admoniſhing every one with tears. And you ſee theſe two wayes meeting thoughout his Epiſtles; in which, he not only expoundeth the myſteries of faith; but ever, and anon deſcendeth to the applying of thoſe inſtructions, to the carriage of thoſe whom he inſtructeth; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them, chiding them, comforting them, encouraging them, as they had need. And as he practis'd thus himſelf; ſo he gave order, for the like procedure, to others, whom GOD had called to the holy miniſtry.
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.2. 1 Tim. 3.2. 2 Tim. 2.24. Tit. 1.9. 2 Tim. 3.16, 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Preach the word</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy) be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, and doctrine.</hi> And elſewhere he wills in general, <hi>that every Paſtor be, not only apt to teach; but alſo able, to admoniſh by ſound doctrine, and to convince gainſayers.</hi> Indeed, theſe two offices are neceſſary for the edifying of the faithful, which is the end of the miniſtry. It is not enough to propoſe the ſecrets of the Goſpel in general unto them; general things do not much ſtir us. They muſt be touched in particular; and the word of God which is the inſtrument of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, is proper for theſe two operations, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly noteth, when he ſaith, <hi>that the Scripture is profitable, for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50919:76"/>in righteouſsneſs, that the man of GOD</hi> (that is, His ſervant, or his miniſter) <hi>may be accompliſhed, and perfectly furniſhed unto every good work.</hi> Such then, as the LORD hath honoured with this ſacred miniſtry, ſhould labour both in the one, and the other of theſe two performances; and make account, that he calleth them, not ſimply to teach, but alſo to admoniſh. For this here is not the pew of a Profeſſor of Mathematiques, or Phyſick; who hath no other buſineſs, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the ſecrets of thoſe ſciences, to thoſe that hear them. This Chair hath been prepared in the Church, for the conducting of men to ſalvation; not meerly to make them underſtand: but to give them everlaſting life; to illuminate their minds; to form their lives unto holineſs, to pluck them out of the ſnares of Satan, and cauſe them to walk in the wayes of GOD. Faithful Brethren, ſince you know, that ſuch is the nature of our charges, you ſhould not think it ſtrange, or ill, that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute them, in this manner, among you. There are ſome, that have a tender ear. They willingly hear information, and doctrine: but cannot bear remonſtrances. Diſcourſe, about the myſteries of religion, is pleaſing to them; but about their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and their duty, burthenſome. And this tenderneſs is a very bad ſign; as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their morals are not found. As a Phyſician judgeth, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs, ſome ſinew hurted, or ſome collection of unnatual humors, in thoſe parts of the body, which he cannot touch, without putting the Patient to pain. If you would have our miniſtrations, to be entirely grateful to you, reform your manners, that nothing may remain in your life, but what is healthy, and vigorous. Remonſtrances do importune thoſe only, that have a diſeaſed Soul. But they ſhould conſider, that if they be troubleſome to them, they are neceſſary for them: and if the intereſt of our Office do oblige us, to make them; the intereſt of their ſalvation, doth much more oblige them to ſuffer the ſame. It is a ſalt ſomewhat ſharp, but wholſome; a potion, bitter, but conducing to health. But the Apoſtles addition, <hi>that he teacheth in all wiſdom,</hi> muſt not be forgotten. There is no need, I ſhould advertiſe you, that he ſpeaks of heavenly wiſdom; of that truth, which is neceſſary to be known, for the obtaining of Salvation. It is evident therefore, when he ſaith, <hi>he teacheth in all this wiſdom,</hi> he ſignifies, that he declareth all the myſteries of it, to ſuch as he inſtructeth; that he hideth no part of it from them, which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them to know, for their arriving at the inheritance of JESUS CHRIST. It is the very thing, that he ſpeaks elſewhere more clearly, and in expreſs words; namely, when he taketh the Biſhops, or Paſtors, of the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to witneſs, that he had kept back nothing from them, which was profitable for them; but had taught it them,
<note place="margin">Act. 20.20, 21, 27.</note> and preached it publickly, and from houſe to houſe, tesſtifying both to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> repentance towards GOD, and faith in JESUS CHRIST our LORD; and a little after. I have not ſhunned (ſaith he) to declare to you all the counſel of GOD. Whence it appears, that the traditions, which are pretended to have been, not publickly, and generally taught to all the faithful, but delivered in ſecret to ſome only by the Apoſtles, are not at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to mens Salvation. He that hath learned, what the Apoſtle taught all men, knows enough, ſince he taught in all wiſdom; except men will ſay, that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſome knowledge, who hath learned all wiſdom. But it hath alwaies been one of the artifices of curioſity, to feign, that men of GOD did not publiſh all; and that they committed a part of their inſtructions, only to the ears of ſome, that were more perfect than the vulgar; to the end, that under this pretext, it may make its own diſquiſitions, and inventions paſs, for articles of divine doctrine. I know well, that this is a meer imagination; as weak, as it is bold; and ſuch as hath no other foundation, than the paſſion of thoſe, that advance it. But it is not my buſineſs, to make any further inquiry, into the vanity of it. For what ever it be, ſince S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught every man, in all wiſdom, my ſimplicity is henceforth in ſafety. The ignorance of your pretented ſecrets, cannot be prejudicial to me, ſince all the wiſdom of the Goſpel, is compriſed, in the Apoſtles publick, and common teachings. From the ſame conſideration, you may perceive alſo, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant the dreaming of thoſe is, who would make it be believed, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church is poliſhed, and perfected from age to age, the ſucceding having added to the light of thoſe, that went before; and that we ſhould not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50919:76"/>wonder, if the ancients either knew not, or even ſpake contrary, to ſome of the Articles of the Modern Divinity: foraſmuch (ſay they) as the Church, not having yet at that time declared them, the belief of them was not neceſſary. By this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Faith will have been imperfect, in the Apoſtles time. Yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here, that what he Preached to all men, was all wiſdom; and he will add immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, that by it, <hi>he rendred every man perfect in CHRIST JESUS.</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be ſaid in the matter, it is clear, that it's enough to know the things, that are ſufficient to ſave us. If that, which the Apoſtles Preached, did ſuffice for the ſalvation of the firſt believers, we have nothing to do with that which men have added ſince. For we ſeek but our ſalvation; and it's ſottiſhneſs to imagine, that what was ſufficient to ſave believers in thoſe dayes, is not ſufficient to do it in ours; as if GOD had changed his deſign; and the revelation of His Son, and the Apoſtles Preaching were not the ſeal and the laſt perfection of all His diſpenſations. The Articles which have been declared in the latter ages, did make up a part of the wiſdom Preached by the Apoſtles, or no. If they made up a part of it, they were no leſs neceſſary for the firſt ages, than for the latter. If they made up no part of it, they are now as little neceſſary as ever. And it avails nothing, to alledge the Church, to us. For what authority ſoever may be aſcribed to the company, which is ſo called, it hath not enough, to make that neceſſary, which in reality is not ſo; not enough, to ſhut up, what GOD hath opened; nor to contract, what He hath dilated; or to bind, what He hath looſed. If GOD will ſave us, without belief of the Maſs, or of Purgatory; the Church would do well to will the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; would ſhe not? GOD will judge us, by His own will, and word; and not by the fantaſtical conceits, or imaginations of men.</p>
                     <p>But I return to the Apoſtle, who ſheweth us alſo, in this Text, (and it's that, which we are to conſider, in the third place) what the object of this his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, when he ſaith, <hi>that he admoniſheth every man, and teacheth every man.</hi> It's very probable, that the falſe Teachers, who would ſeduce the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> for the colouring of that obſervation of the Law, which they recommended, did alledge, that the Apoſtles themſelves left the Jews the uſe of Circumciſion, and the practice of legal abſtinences; and that if S. <hi>Paul</hi> did otherwiſe, it was but towards ſome only. I account, it is to this properly, that we muſt referr and oppoſe, his ſaying here three times, <hi>that he admoniſheth every man, that he teacheth every man, and that he might render every man perfect in CHRIST.</hi> He thus repeats this word to them, to ſhew, that his Preaching was the ſame, and uniform throughout: that he declared to all men, but one ſole JESUS CHRIST; and that he Preached Him indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently both to Jews and Gentiles, Greeks and Barbarians; GOD having given for them all, but one and the ſame Goſpel; as He hath ſet up but one Sun, in the Univerſe, to ſhine on all mankind. <hi>I declare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſame CHRIST unto all, as Saviour and Redeemer of the world. There is no man, to whom I Preach any other thing.</hi> Whereby he gives a ſecret blow to the doctrine of theſe Seducers, which was particular, and not Preached, either by the holy Apoſtle, or by any of his fellows. It may well be alſo, that he aimed to ſhew here, in his way, the extent of his charge, which encloſed all men on earth within its compaſs, there being no one of them, to whom he had not authority to Preach the Goſpel, and to admoniſh and teach him. According to his ſaying elſewhere, <hi>that he is debter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1.14.</note> 
                        <hi>both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wiſe, and to the unwiſe;</hi> for the ſeaſonable eſtabliſhing of the power, he will uſe anon, to admoniſh the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and condemn the Seducers. For he ſhews thereby, that there is no perſon, how knowing ſoever he may be otherwayes, but is his Scholler, for this Heavenly wiſdom, and ought in this reſpect to be ſubject to his inſtructions, and to learn of Him the myſteries of the ſame. As if he had ſaid, that GOD hath raiſed him to the Doctoral Chair of the univerſe, and made him His publick, and univerſal Herauld, who ſhould be hearkened to, by all the men of the world. Whence it follows, that theſe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Maſters of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> who would intrude to teach them, after their mode, did thwart the inſtitution of GOD; and that before they did put themſelves, upon the inſtructing of others, they ſhould firſt have learned, of the Apoſtle, the true myſteries of the wiſdom of GOD. I acknowledge, there is not any one of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50919:77"/>Miniſters of GOD, who hath now this great extent of Authority, that the Apoſtle here aſcribeth, and with truth, to himſelf. Nevertheleſs each of them ought to do, in his diſtrict, what the Apoſtle did, in his; even admoniſh, and teach every man, whoever he be, in all wiſdom; have but one, and the ſame Goſpel for all; not pleaſing doctrine, and, as is commonly ſaid, a Velvet Goſpel, for the rich; and another quite different, for the poor; but treat them all without reſpect of perſons: not conceal ought from the one, which hath been diſcovered to the others; each one ought, to teach the ſmall, as well as the great; to admoniſh the great, as well as the ſmall; to edifie them all in common, without deſpiſing the littleneſs of the one, without fearing the greatneſs of the other.</p>
                     <p>But let us now ſee, what the end, of this Preaching JESUS CHRIST, is. <hi>We declare Him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>admoniſhing, and teaching every man in all wiſdom, that we may render every man perfect in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> This was the Apoſtle's aim; this was the deſign of his labours, even to preſent, all thoſe that heard him, <hi>holy, and unreprovable, unto JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> to put them into ſuch an eſtate, by his Preaching, as that they might appear, before the Throne of Grace, without confuſion. He expreſſeth it elſewhere in other terms; namely, when he ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.2.</note> in particular, <hi>that he had appropriated them, or knit them, or as it were eſpouſed them to one husband, that I might preſent you,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as a chaſte Virgin unto CHRIST;</hi> where he uſeth preciſely the ſame word, which he placeth here, and which we <hi>(French)</hi> have tranſlated, in the one of theſe places <hi>(rendre) render,</hi> and <hi>(preſenter) preſent,</hi> in the other. You know, there are two ſorts of perfection; one of a believer's minority; the other of his full age, according as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth our times, in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.11.</note> The one, that which we have here below, during the courſe of our Pilgrimage. The other that, which we ſhall not have but in Heaven, our true Countrey. This latter is a perfection every way compleat; ſuch, as comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the degrees of knowledge, holineſs, and glory, which our nature is capable of. The former is a perfection begun, having all the parts of ſanctification, and conſolation, that are neceſſary, in our preſent frailty, but not yet brought up to the top, and higheſt degrees. The one is ſimply, and abſolutely called, <hi>Perfection,</hi> the other is ſo named, but in ſome reſpect, and in compariſon, either of the eſtate, which we were, and other men not regenerate are ſtill in, or of the condition of our age. The Apoſtle means the firſt,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.12, 15.</note> when he confeſſeth, <hi>that he is not already perfect.</hi> He ſpeaks of the ſecond, when he faith, <hi>Let us all that are perfect, be thus minded.</hi> The one, and the other is the end of the Preaching of the Goſpel. For the deſign of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of all true Miniſters of the LORD, is, to guide the faithful to eternal ſalvation; that is, to the laſt and higheſt of theſe two kinds of perfection, by means of the firſt. And ſo the nearer effect of their Preaching, and which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly follows it, is the believer's perfection on earth. The further and more remote effect of it, which neceſſarily, and infallibly reſults from the firſt, is his perfection in Heaven. Moreover, this firſt perfection, to which Preaching immediately tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, conſiſteth of two parts chiefly, Knowledge, and Sanctification; Faith, and Charity; And though there be many defects, both in the one, and the other, if you compare them with the viſion, and glory of Heaven, yet the one, and the other are, even at preſent, perfect in ſome ſort, to wit, in as much, as the true believer wanteth not any of the knowledges, and habitudes, that are neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And it's to this the Apoſtle reduceth it, when he reſtraineth the perfection he ſpeaks of, to JESUS CHRIST; <hi>that we may render every man perfect in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> ſaith he. It's to His abundance, that we owe our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; foraſmuch as He giveth us what we have of it, by His Spirit; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, what we want of it, by the riches of His merit. The Apoſtle conſiders the Believer's perfection here, in its whole extent, that is, in regard both of faith, and of holineſs. I confeſs, he doth particularly intend the firſt of theſe. For it ſeems to me evident, that he hath an eye to the errour of the Seducers, who added the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, the worſhipping of Angels, and ſuch other Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the inſtructions of the Goſpel, as if the faith of Chriſtians were imperfect without them. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to overthrow this pernicious dotage, doth ſeaſonably lay
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50919:77"/>firm, that the Preaching of the Goſpel is enough to render every man perfect, who receiveth it with ſaith, that there is no need, either of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of Angels; no need of the Ceremonies of the one, or of the ſervices of the other; that JESUS CHRIST, in whom we are, abundantly ſufficeth, without the adjunction of any other. But though this be the Apoſtles direct aim; yet in that perfection, which he ſpeaks of, together with entireneſs of faith, he doth compriſe, pureneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and of worſhip, which inſeparably depends on it, and without which that faith cannot poſſibly be perfect.</p>
                     <p>Such is the ſenſe of theſe words of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> from which we may learn two things, before we go further on. The firſt is the perfection, and ſufficiency of the doctrine Preached by the Apoſtles. For ſince the end to which it tended, was to make the hearer of it perfect, it is evident, that it had in it all, that was neceſſary to convey this perfection; there being no likelyhood, that GOD would have put a means, into the hands of His ſervants, which was not ſufficient to reach their end, ſuch a fault being incompatible with His infinite wiſdom, and power. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Apoſtles Preaching, would not have been able, to make the faith of their hearers perfect, if they had omitted, in Preaching, any one of thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the believing whereof is neceſſary to ſalvation: It muſt be concluded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they omitted not any one of them. Whence it is clear, by the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that all the traditions, which men advance at this day, are unprofitable. For what ſervice can they do us, ſince we may be perfect, in JESUS CHRIST, without them? It cannot be ſaid, that they were a part of the things, which the Apoſtles Preached. Firſt, the very men, that defend them, dare not affirm it of the moſt of them, it being notoriouſly known, that they roſe up by little, and little, very long after the Apoſtles times. Secondly, becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf deſcribeth to us the matter of his Preaching, <hi>We Preach CHRIST</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>confining it wholly, as you ſee, to the myſterie of our Saviour,</hi> with which theſe Traditions have no more alliance, than thoſe of the Seducers had, which he will afterward refute, who ſought to mingle divers Ceremonies, and the worſhipping of Angels, with the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST. And laſtly, becauſe the Apoſtle elſewhere gives to Scripture, the ſame ſufficiency, which he here aſcribeth to his Preaching, ſaying,
<note place="margin">2 Tim 3.16, 17.</note> 
                        <hi>that All Scripture is by the inſpiration of GOD, and is profitable for doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the man of GOD may be perfect.</hi> But it is clear, that theſe pretended traditions do appear no where at all, in Scripture. Sure then, it is alſo manifeſt, that they are no way neceſſary, to make our faith perfect. But by the ſame grounds, it is apparent again, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the doctrine of <hi>Rome</hi> is. For whereas he ſaith, that the deſign of his Preaching was, <hi>to make every man perfect in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST; Rome,</hi> on the contrary, alloweth this perfection only to Clerks, in the firſt place, and next, unto Monks, not reckoning, that the people, (whom by an odious name, which S <hi>Paul</hi> never gives, but to Pagans, or the profane, they call Seculars, and men of the world, in oppoſition to men of the Church) can, or ſhould ſeek to arrive at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection. And the preſumption of Monks is grown ſo high, that there are no longer any, but perſons hooded, and cloathed in their mode, that are called Religious men, or Religious women; as if every man, who is a true Chriſtian, were not alſo truly religious; and again, they call their condition only, <hi>the ſtate of perfection;</hi> as if all the reſt of the faithful, were but abortives, and imperfect productions. And though this vanity be, ſo out of meaſure injurious, to all other Chriſtians; yet their Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans do ſuffer it, and ſeem, for the moſt part of them, well pleaſed with it; imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under this pretence, that there are none, but Monks, obliged to be perfect; and that, as for themſelves who are in the world, it is not their part, to aſpire ſo high; and in effect, the greater number do ſo freely diſpenſe with themſelves, in the caſe, that truly there is reaſon to call them Seculars indeed. But the holy Apoſtle here, overthrows in two words, the arrogance of the one, and the ſecurity of the other. As for the former, when he telleth us, <hi>he Preacheth the Goſpel, that he might render his hearers perfect,</hi> he clearly ſhews us, that, for our guidance to perfection, we have no need of the Rules either of <hi>Francis,</hi> or <hi>Dominie,</hi> or <hi>Bruno,</hi> or <hi>Loyola;</hi> or the other many pretended Regulars, who as it were outvying one another, daily ſet forth ſome new diſcipline to the World. The LORD JESUS hath provided long ago
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50919:78"/>for our perfection, giving us a moſt compleat, and very eaſie rule, to attain it; after which, it is an exorbitant raſhneſs, to reſolve the eſtabliſhing of another. Follow that rule, Chriſtian, embrace that, and proceed conſtantly in the way of holineſs, which it hath preſcribed you; and be confident, that ſo doing, you ſhall not fail of being perfect, though you wear not <hi>Francis</hi>'s Frock, and Hood; or <hi>Loyola</hi>'s little Band. But the Apoſtle here, no leſs condemneth, the ſecurity of thoſe, that are called Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, than the vanity of ſuch, as ſtile themſelves Religious. For he ſaith expreſly, and univerſally, that his deſign is <hi>to render every man perfect in CHRIST JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> He will have no other Diſciples. He owneth none for his Schollers, but ſuch as aim at perfection; ſuch as vow it, and labour after it daily. If you remain Secular, and in ſtate of imperfection, his Preaching hath not wrought it's effect in you; and as you have not part in that perfection, to which he would form you in this life, no more ſhall you have part, in that, to which he deſireth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you, in the next life. There is but one ſort of Chriſtians, even ſuch, as having believed the Goſpel, do mortifie the deeds of the body, and crucifie their fleſh, with it's affections, and who forgetting the things which are behind, do advance ſome ſteps daily; towards the mark, and prize of their calling; ſuch as <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe ſpeech about it you are now hearing, hath prevailed to render, by the efficaciouſneſs of his Preaching, <hi>perfect in CHRIST JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> It's a miſtake, it's a folly, to fancy any others. Theſe double, or middling Chriſtians, that would at once be, both Chriſtians, and worldlings, diſciples of Heaven, and of Earth; have no more place in reality of nature, than in the Scriptures of GOD. If you would have place, among the perfect ones of the life to come, be betimes, among the perfect of this life. There's no aſcending to the one of theſe perfections, but by the other; If you will be one day in the number of full-grown men of JESUS CHRIST; be now in the number of His Children. Walk in faith, and in love, during this Pilgrimage, if you pretend to the viſion, and glory, of the heavenly Country.</p>
                     <p>But it is now time, My Brethren, to ſay ſomething to you of the Apoſtle's labour, and combats; having ſpoken of his Preaching: <hi>Whereunto I alſo labour,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>combating according to His efficacy, which worketh powerfully in me.</hi> Sure there is no Chriſtian, but meets, in the way to Heaven, with many thorns; which the fleſh, the World, and the Devil, do ſow there; for that they cannot ſuffer, that any one ſhould undertake ſo glorious a deſign, but they muſt croſs him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> utmoſt of their power. Yet among all the faithful, there are none, that have more labours, and combats to undergo, than the Miniſters of the Goſpel. This high Office, beſides that it is firſt very painful in its ſelf, doth next draw the hatred, and perſecutions of the enemy, upon them, more than others; and again, among all thoſe whom GOD hath honoured with this divine employment, it muſt be acknowledged, that the Apoſtles are the men, who had moſt difficulties to ſurmount, and afflictions to wade through. All our pains, to ſay true, are but Childrens play, in compariſon of the combats, that theſe great Warriers had to fight. For who doth not know, that in every work of importance, the beginning is ever much more difficult, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and proſecution? The Apoſtles brake up the ground, wherein we labour; They opened, and planed the race, in which we run; They with infinite pain, laid the foundations of the houſe, which we build. The buſineſs at that time was, to overthrow Paganiſm, to demoliſh <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> to fill up great deeps, and to make plain mountains; whereas we enter upon a work already ſetled, and fixed. They went through a Country, where was neither way, nor path, nor any thing, favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them; whereas we go in the track, they have made. To all this we muſt alſo adde, the great extent of their charges, which encloſed the whole univerſe, and obliged them to take care of all the Nations of the World: whereas we labour each of us, in a ſmall parcel of this great, and vaſt heritage of the Son of GOD. What ſhall I ſay of the perſecutions, which Satan raiſed up, and brought upon them in all quarters, animating all the powers of the world againſt them, and ſubtily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them in this war, ſome by a zeal for the Religion of their Fathers, others by reaſons of State; ſome by a jealouſie for reputation, others by their paſſion for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and vices? To overcome ſo many difficulties, and to advance (as they did) a work, whoſe ſucceſs was, in appearance, as impoſſible, as if they had undertaken,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50919:78"/>to diſplace the bounds of the world, and to change mountains, and ſeas, it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently neceſſary, that theſe holy men ſhould toil, in an extraordinary manner, and ſtrive with a quite other vigor. than any of all the reſt of the faithful ever had. But though they all applied themſelves to ſuch ſervice, with an indefatigable, and couragious earneſtneſs, and with an admirable conſtancy of mind: yet ſure S. <hi>Paul</hi> did particularly ſignalize himſelf, among thoſe bleſſed Patriarks of the new people, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD; For as to labour, which he mentions firſt, none of them all preached CHRIST, with more fervour; none of them preſſed men, to yield themſelves to Him, with more vehemency; none began with more allacrity; nor went on with more aſſiduity. There never was tongue more active, nor pen more Divine, nor mind more vigilant. He alone travelled well-nigh as many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as all the reſt together. He viſited all nations, ſowing the Goſpel every where, watering it night, and day, by His ſpeech, by his tears, and by his cares with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible pains. He had no ſooner achieved one conqueſt, but he enterprized ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the end of one labour was to him, but the beginning of another. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ambition, or avarice, though the moſt reſtleſs of our paſſions, put men of the world, to half the pain, that the deſign of bringing mankind, to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the LORD JESUS promiſed, cauſed unto him. And as the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which the Sun hath, to communicate his comfortable beams to all creatures, keeps him in a perpetual motion, without permitting him to have one moments reſt; So S. <hi>Pauls</hi> charity, and the paſſion he had, to ſhed abroad every way, the light, and life, and bleſſedneſs, wherewith his Maſter had filled him, preſſing him alike both day, and night, made him take his courſe, without ceaſing, and roul continually about mankind, preſenting his treaſures, ſometimes to one country, and ſometimes to another, paſſing all the days he lived, in this glorious unquietneſs. Neither did he overlaſh at all, when he ſaid ſomewhere, being compelled to it,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.10.</note> by the unequitableneſs of his Calumniators, <hi>that he had laboured more abundantly, than any of the reſt.</hi> That part of his ſtory, which S. <hi>Lake</hi> hath told us, in the <hi>Acts,</hi> doth juſtifie the truth of thoſe words of his, and theſe fourteen divine Epiſtles, which he hath left us, and which do themſelves make up part of his admirable labours, do as clearly ſhew us, how the caſe ſtood indeed. His combats, were no leſs, than his miniſterial labours. For by them, he meaneth the perils, and the ſufferings, upon which, his diſcharging his Apoſtleſhip, and the preaching of the Goſpel, did caſt him every hour, which he frequently compares, to the combats that were at that time, ſolemnized in <hi>Greece;</hi> becauſe thoſe, that entred into them, had divers pains, and inconveniences to ſuffer, as he ſheweth at large, towards the end of the ninth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> He had more enemies to ſuſtain,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.25, 26, 27.</note> than any of the reſt; <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> without; Seducers, and falſe brethren within. It may make us tremble, but to read the perſecutions, and the croſſes he received from the one, and the others. Himſelf hath drawn up a little Catalogue of them, wherein he repreſents to us, through what depths of afflictions he had paſſed, and did ſtill daily paſs, being purſued out of meaſure, both by his own country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and alſo by the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> He was beaten, impriſoned, ſcourged, ſtoned; He was in ſhipwracks, on the Sea; in dangers, and deaths, upon the Land. He was brought to be, at the mercy of robbers in deſarts, beſet round in cities, both with weapons of enemies, and the ambuſhments of falſe friends. He was reduced to nakedneſs, to cold, to hunger, and thirſt; It's this hard, and terrible chain of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and ſufferings, which he meaneth here, when he ſaith, <hi>Whereunto I alſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, combating.</hi> But Oh the deep humility of this holy Soul! he immediately gives the glory of theſe merveilous exploits, to the ſole vertue, and aſſiſtance of the LORD JESUS. <hi>I labour, and combat</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to His effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which worketh powerfully in me.</hi> He exerciſeth the like modeſty elſewhere; when having ſaid, <hi>that he had laboured abundantly more, than they all,</hi> he preſently takes up himſelf, and adds, <hi>yet not I, but the grace of GOD, which is with me.</hi> It is the invincible force of this grace of the LORD JESUS, which he calleth here, his efficacy; and he ſaith, it worketh powerfully in him, or with power, to ſignifie the admirable effects, which it produced in him; firſt, in that it raiſed up in Him, the light of knowledge, the love of holineſs, charity towards the LORD's
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50919:79"/>flock, ſuch prudence, and wiſdom, as were neceſſary for the inſtruction, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſouls. Secondly, in that it endued him with a more than humane courage, with an immoveable conſtancy and firmneſs, both that he might not ſink under the burden of ſuch great, and continual labour; and that he might pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and cheerfully bear the perſecutions, and tentations, which were ſtill let looſe upon him; the LORD making things tend to His glory, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his work, which ſeemed ſo contrary thereto, as He promiſed him elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that His power ſhould be made perfect in his infirmity. Thirdly, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the Apoſtles preaching, with diverſe miracles, which raviſhed men, and authoriſed his words,
<note place="margin">Rom. 15.18, 19</note> as he expreſly teſtifies in another place. <hi>I will not dare to ſpeak of any of thoſe things, which CHRIST hath not wrought by me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to make the</hi> Gentiles <hi>obedient by word, and work, through mighty ſigns, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Laſtly, this Divine vertue of our Saviour, did alſo magnificently appear, in the ſucceſs he gave to <hi>Pauls</hi> labour, opening the hearts of thoſe, that heard him, and cauſing his voice to enter into them, notwithſtanding all the impediments of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; with ſuch a miraculous bleſſing, that he made his Goſpel to abound, from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and round about, even to <hi>Illyricum,</hi> ſubduing nations, and converting them gloriouſly to the ſervice of His Maſter. It's this that he repreſents here to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> in theſe words, even that he laboureth, and combateth according to the efficacy of CHRIST, which worketh powerfully in him. And it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently conduceth to his deſign, which is to ſhew the truth of the Goſpel he preached; which ſhined forth clearly in thoſe many miracles, they being as ſeals by which the LORD confirmed it.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs now, that this great example, doth particularly reflect on ſuch, as GOD hath called to the ſacred Miniſtry of His houſe: and it ſheweth them, on one hand, how painful their office is; that it is a work, (as the Apoſtle faith otherwhere) a work (I ſay) rather than a dignity;
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.1. 2 Tim. 4.5.</note> a labour, and not a recreation. For the diſcharging of it worthily, they muſt toil, and ſtrive, watch in all things, endure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and do the work of Evangeliſts. And it teacheth them, on the other hand, that they muſt not recoil, for thoſe great difficulties; but truſt in the grace of CHRIST, and expect, from the ſole efficaciouſneſs of His aſſiſtance, that light, that ſtrength, that patience, and conſtancy which is requiſite, for the finiſhing of ſo laborious a courſe; ſince it is He alone, who rendreth us meet for theſe things, ſtrengthning us in weakneſs, comforting us in trouble, encouraging us in difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſuſteining us under aſſaults, and ſo conducting us, that though we be nothing of our ſelves,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5.</note> yet, in Him, we can do all things, who maketh us able to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the new Teſtament. But though S. <hi>Pauls</hi> example do particularly reſpect Paſtors; yet it appertaineth alſo to all true Chriſtians in general; ſince there is no one of them, but is alſo, in ſome ſort, the LORD's ſervant; hath of Him, the managing of ſome of His Talents; and is called to labour, and combat. Let us conſider then, all of us in common; and joyntly make our improvement, both of the preaching, and of the labouring of this great Apoſtle. He ſtill at this day, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to us, the ſame CHRIST, whom he preached heretofore to all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world. Though the Organs, that ſound it to you, be incomparably weaker, than his were, yet it is his word that you hear; the ſame word, and the ſame CHRIST, that yer-while converted the univerſe. The ſame <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe voyce had then ſo much efficacy, ſpeaks yet to you daily. He addreſſeth to you the ſame doctrine; He ſets before you the ſame wiſdom; He admoniſheth, and teacheth every man among you. Do not abuſe ſo great a bleſſing; do not fruſtrate the labour of this holy man, of it's true, and juſt effect. The end of His preaching is, that you all may be perfect. This is the mark, to which he calls you all in common. Say not to me, that he ſpeaks, but to ſome only. <hi>I admoniſh,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and teach every man, that I may render every man perfect in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> Object not the employments, which you have in the world, nor the cares, to which your family, and your affairs do bind you up. If they be incompatible with that perfection, which the Apoſtle requires of you, you muſt renounce them. It's an extreme folly, to excuſe ones ſelf from being happy. This ought to be the firſt, and laſt of our cares; and if we cannot attain it, but by quitting of honours, by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50919:79"/>loſing of riches, by retrenching our delights, yea (as the LORD ſaith) by pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our own eyes, and cutting off of our feet, and our hands; it is better to forego all this, than keep it, to be caſt, at our departure hence, into the torment of eternal fire. But theſe are vain, and meer frivolous pretences, to palliate our ſlackneſs. If we have truly received JESUS CHRIST into our hearts, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wife, nor children, nor a family, nor an eſtate, nor the honeſt, and lawfull employments of the world, will hinder you from being perfect. The fear of GOD, honeſt deportment, plain-dealing, and juſtice; charity, and beneficence, and in a word, the fanctity, wherein our perfection conſiſteth, is not incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with any of theſe things. For, I beſeech you, is it your buſineſs, or your call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which obligeth you, to offend GOD, and injure men? to pollute your body with the filth of infamous pleaſures? to defraud; or to rob your neighbour? to drown your whole life, in luxury, in debauches, and in ſlothfulneſs? No, no, Chriſtian; excuſe not your ſelves, by ſuch allegations. The affairs of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and of your trade, are altogether innocent of your faults. To ſay true, they rather invite you, to honeſty, and innocency; than ſollicite you to vice. It's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the rage of your ungoverned paſſions, that cauſeth this diſorder. It is nothing, but your ambition, your covetouſneſs, your pride, your effeminateneſs, and delicacy, that turneth you away from Chriſtian perfection. To tend to it, there is no need, you ſhould retire into a Deſert, or a Cloiſter, nor that your habits, or your food, ſhould be different, from thoſe of the people, among whom you live; There needs for this, but retiring from vice, and ſincere renouncing the practice of it; plucking up the luſts of it, out of your heart, changing your life, and not your dwelling, your carriage, and not your clothes. And this is it, my Beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, wherein we muſt labour, and combat. The deſign I call you to is great, and painful, and no leſs difficult, than the conqueſt of the world; the buſineſs of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Apoſtleſhip. For there is nothing that is, either more harſh to us, than to renounce our paſſions; or more difficult, than for us to overcome our ſelves. It is much more eaſie to wear a Cowle, or an hair-cloth, and blacken the body with blows, yea to kill ones ſelf, than to put off the deſires of the fleſh. Labour then earneſtly, and aſſiduouſly; ſince you have undertaken ſo difficult a task. Employ all your time in it: Let no day paſs, without putting it on; watching, and praying, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying all the members of your old man, with a true penitence; reading, and meditating the word of GOD, embracing His promiſes, exerciſing your ſelves, in the ſtudy, and practice, of thoſe good, and holy works, which he hath recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto us. The deſign is great, and you are weak. But the LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, in whom you have believed, is allmighty, and allmerciful. He hath ſtill the ſame force, which heretofore converted the world by the hand of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> If you labour in his work, with ſuch zeal, as His Apoſtle did, He will alſo communicate His graces unto you. He will diſplay His vertue, upon you. He will work power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in you. He will bruiſe Satan under your feet, and crucifie your fleſh, by the efficacy of His own. He will vivifie your ſpirit by the light of His. He will make you to triumph over your enemies. He will comfort you in the afflictions, which you ſhall ſuffer for ſo good a cauſe. He will guide you in all your wayes. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the labour, and the combat, will crown you, on high in the Heavens, with ſuch glory, and immortality, as all the pains of the preſent life, are no way comparable to. So be it; and unto Him, as alſo to the Father, and to the Holy Spirit, the only true GOD, bleſſed for ever, be honour, and glory, to ages of ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG the advantages, which the Reformation of the Church, embraced by our Fathers, in theſe latter ages, hath afforded us, we muſt, without doubt, aſcribe the preheminence, to the free uſe we have of the word of CHRIST; which He, of His abundant Grace, hath recovered for us. This Divine Taper, lighted up from Heaven, in the houſe of GOD, to ſhine unto His people, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main hid a long time, under a Buſhel, (that I may expreſs it,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.15.</note> in the terms of the Goſpel) the negligence, and fraud of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it in this ſhameful-ſtate. It is now ſet anew, on its Candleſtick, whence it diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth every way, its enlivening, and ſaving light among us; and that in ſuch abundance, as we may truly ſay in this reſpect, the word of CHRIST dwelleth richly in us.
<note place="margin">Col. 3.6.</note> It reigneth alone, in our aſſemblies, where its voice, and not any other, is continualy heard to reſound; the Fables, and Legends of men being altogether baniſhed thence. It is read there in a familiar language, which every one underſtands; whereas if it be read elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, it's in a tongue, dead, and barbarous, and unknown to the people. It is explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us, with all fidelity, ſincerity, and diligence, whereas amid the darkneſs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, it was ſo unworthily treated by Preachers, that to conſider their Sermons, one would think, they had deſigned to make it openly ridiculous. I confeſs, thoſe perſons, that abide in the erroneous opinions of their Anceſtors, yet are ſomewhat aſhamed of this groſs, and prophane licentious practice of theirs; and they have reformed it after a ſort: Yet there remain, but too many defects among them ſtill, and this one in particular, that they explain, in publick, only ſome pieces, and (if it may be ſaid) ſhreads of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſometimes taken from one book, ſometimes from another, never ſhewing their hearers any complete body. For it cannot be denied, but that this manner of handling the word of GOD, doth deprive the faithful of much edification; it being evident, that
<pb facs="tcp:50919:82"/>the view, and the conſidering, of an entire book, giveth us a great deal more of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in it, and admiration at it, than the view of any part of it, alone, and taken off from the whole, can do. This fault is ſo much the leſs pardonable, in our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; for that, beſides reaſon, it croſſeth alſo the cuſtom, and authority of thoſe anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Doctors of the firſt ages of Chriſtianity, whoſe true ſons, and legitimate ſucceſſors, theſe Gentlemen, boaſt, they are. For it was frequent at that time, for Paſtors to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound in the Church, whole books of Scripture throughout, by Sermons continued on, upon the chain of the holy Text, from the beginning of a volume to the very end: that remainder, which we have, of the writings of thoſe days, doth clearly evince ſo much. There are extant ſtill, the Sermons of S. <hi>John Chryſoſtom,</hi> upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> upon the Goſpels of S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> upon the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and upon all the fourteen Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> which were delivered by this great man, part of them in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and part, in the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the greateſt, and moſt populous Churches of all the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> And among the <hi>Latines,</hi> we have the Tractates of S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> upon the whole Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and upon the Goſpel of S. <hi>John,</hi> and upon His firſt Epiſtle, which were in like manner, made and delivered in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his people. An evident ſign, that about the beginning of the fifth Century, when theſe two excellent, and famous perſonages did flouriſh, this cuſtom was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute among Chriſtians. Whether then, the thing be conſidered in its ſelf, or the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Ancients be taken, it is manifeſt that our Fathers, and our ſelves, had all the reaſons in the world, to re-eſtabliſh this ſacred, and juſt uſage, in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, this Book, which I addreſs unto you, is a fruit of it. For having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, in conformity to this order, to expound, in our holy aſſemblies, the Divine Epiſtle of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and being come to the end of it, by the grace of our LORD, becauſe the whole work, could not be commodiouſly contracted into one volume only, I have divided it, into three parts; of which this here, is the ſecond. The Piety, which hath long flouriſhed in your Houſe, Sir, and the exquiſite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that GOD hath given you, of His truth, do induce me to believe, that this Books which wholy treats of His Divine myſteries, and nothing elſe, will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to you. It's this hath given me the liberty, to put your name upon it: a Name, which diverſe excellent graces, wherewith GOD hath adorned, both your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and your Perſon, do render very dear, and very honourable, in our Church. I am ſorry, that this Preſent is no more worthy of it. But ſuch as it is, I do not deſpair, but it may obtain, from the dignity of its ſubject, and from the favour of your goodneſs, that acceptance, which it cannot pretend to upon any merit of its own. Pleaſe you then, to receive it, as a ſincere teſtimony of the reſpect, I bear your vertue, and of the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe I have of the friendſhip, wherewith you honour me: withal, as an inviolable pledge of the prayers, which I preſent unto GOD for your proſperity, and of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent affection, I have, to be, as long as I live.</p>

                        <hi>DEar Brethren,</hi> As Gardeners, and Husbandmen, do not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with ſowing good grain, in the ground that they manure; but alſo take care to pluck up thence the bad herbs, which might choak, or incommodate the good: So in the Spiritual husbandry of JESUS CHRIST, it is not enough that the Miniſters of his Goſpel, do caſt his Divine Word, the good and ſaving ſeed of our Regeneration into the Souls of Men; They muſt alſo be at the pains to weed, and cleanſe this myſtical Soil, the tilling whereof is committed to them; plucking up out of it, error and falſe doctrine, thoſe bad and pernicious weeds, which ſpringing up of themſelves, or being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily ſown there by an enemy's hand, are apt to marr all this coeleſtial tillage. Hence it is that the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> having in the firſt Chapter of this Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ſetled the truth with great efficacy, as you have heard, cometh now in this ſecond Chapter, the beginning whereof we have read, to reject, and refute the errors, which certain falſe workers, miniſters of Satan, endeavoured to ſhuffle in; that this people as a field, or a garden of God's, being rid of all naughty, and noxious grain, the noble ſeed of the Goſpel, which the Apoſtle had caſt there, might take root, and ſpring up, and grow at liberty, covering and crowning it all over with the flowers and fruits of incorruption, (that is, ſincere piety, and true ſanctity) no ſtrange plant being mingled with it. Theſe Seducers (as we have often intimated) did teach, that beſides faith in JESUS CHRIST, which they made profeſſion of, there was alſo a neceſſity of obſerving the <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Law, and of worſhipping of Angels, and of practiſing certain ſuperſtitious Diſciplines, and Mortifications, of their own invention. And to put off the whole the better, they mingled with it ſome ſubtilties, and vain ſpeculations of ſecular Philoſophy. This is the weed which the Apoſtle, the Church's holy Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, now roots up out of his LORD's field; fortifying the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> againſt the craft of that ſort of men; and divinely ſhewing them, how full, and ſufficient, the doctrine of his Goſpel was; how unprofitable, and even plainly dangerous, the Seducers additions were. You ſhall hear it afterwards, in the progreſs of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For, as to the two Verſes, we have read, and the three, or four following, they are as the entrance, or gate of this diſpute; the Apoſtle in them, preparing the hearts of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to receive his inſtructions, by the evidences he gives them, of his ardent affection for their Salvation; and preſently in the firſt Verſe, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth to them the pains he was in for them, and for their neighbours: <hi>I would</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ye knew, how great a combat I have for you,</hi> &amp;c.—Then he addeth, in the following Verſe, the end, or the cauſe of this combat of his: <hi>To the end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that their hearts might be comforted,</hi> &amp;c.—Theſe two points now, we purpoſe to handle, in the preſent action, by the aſſiſtance of the grace of CHRIST; S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s care, and combat for the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> and <hi>Laodiceans:</hi> then his deſign, or the end, for which he underwent all this trouble for them.</p>
                     <p>In reference to the firſt of theſe two points, ye may remember, the Apoſtle
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50919:83"/>affirmed, in the end of the precedent Chapter, that to diſcharge the Miniſtry, which GOD had committed to him, he did labour and combat, according to his efficacy, that wrought powerfully in him. Now he deſcendeth from Generalities, to a particular inſtance; and having ſpoken in groſs of the labour he did undergo for the edification of all, he tells the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> of the pain he was in particularly for them; adding, <hi>For I would that ye knew, how great a combat I have for you, and for thoſe of Laodicea.</hi> It is not without cauſe (ſaith he) that I profeſs to ſtrive, and labour, for the edification of the faithful. For, not to alledg other proofs of it to you, GOD knoweth, and I deſire you alſo ſhould know, that I ſuſtain a great combat for you, and your neighbours. <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which he ſpeaks of, was the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> nigh to <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> which was ſituate in the ſame Province. The Vicinity of theſe two Cities was the cauſe of a particular commerce between thoſe Churches, which GOD had formed in them; whence it comes, that the Apoſtle afterward ſalutes the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> by name, and orders the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to impart this Epiſtle to them. S. <hi>John</hi> alſo, in his <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> makes mention of the Church of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> and it is one of the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to which the LORD JESUS commanded him to write in his name. And by the Letter, which he wrote thereupon, regiſtred in the ſaid Book, it doth appear, that there was much looſneſs, and coldneſs, and many defects, in this flock; whether ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption had got footing there ſo early, as S <hi>Paul</hi>'s own time; or whether (as I judg more probable) it were ſlipt in afterwards, through careleſneſs of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the craft of foes; However it be, there is great likelihood, that <hi>Laodicea</hi> was troubled at this time with the ſame evils that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were; and that theſe Seducers who endeavour'd to infect the one, apply'd themſelves alſo to the other. Therefore the Apoſtle would have this Epiſtle, which is as a preſervative againſt the venom of theſe falſe teachers, to be communicated to thoſe of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea;</hi> an evident ſign, that ſince they had need of the ſame remedies, they were threatned with the ſame maladies.</p>
                     <p>But to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> whom he here expreſly nameth, he further adds indefinitely, all thoſe which had not ſeen his preſence in the fleſh. His name was ſo very famous among Chriſtians, that there could hardly be any one of that number, but had heard ſpeak of him, knew him by reputation, and conſequently had ſeen him in heart, and in ſpirit. But he ſpeaks of thoſe only, that had not ſeen him preſent in body; whether he by theſe words do underſtand all the faithful in general, that had not at all enjoy'd his preſence, in what coaſt or country ſoever they were, (for we know, that the care of this eminent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle extended to them all:) Or whether he ſpeak here of the faithful in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> or in <hi>Aſia</hi> only; which in my opinion, is more likely. For, there being no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that S. <hi>Paul;</hi> and the other Apoſtles, ſhould preſent themſelves every where; they often ſent Evangeliſts, who were as their aſſiſtants and coadjutors, hither and thither to divers places to travel for the Converſion of Souls. And ſo, though the Apoſtle had traverſed the greateſt part of <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſs, and honoured with his preſence and preaching, many of the principal Cities in it, and in ſpecial, the Province of <hi>Phrygia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 16.6. &amp; 18.2, 3.</note> (as may be gathered from the Book of the <hi>Acts:</hi>) Yet it may not be doubted, but that there remained ſtill many Cities to which he had not been able to go in perſon. Expoſitors both ancient and modern, for the moſt part do conclude from theſe words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he had not been yet in the City of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> nor in the City of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> when he wrote this Epiſtle; and they ſuppoſe that he had converted thoſe people, and founded Churches among them, by the Miniſtry of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> without conveying himſelf in perſon thither. Nor can it be denyed, but that the words do give us ſome apparent ground ſo to conceive. For ſaying, <hi>That he hath a great conflict for the Coloſſians, and the Laodiceans, and for all thoſe that had not ſeen his preſence in the fleſh;</hi> he ſeems to enroll the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> and the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> among thoſe that had never ſeen him.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theodoret.</hi> in his Preface to this Epiſt. &amp; on the place it ſelf.</note> Nevertheleſs there are Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors found among the Ancients, and they of as great repute as any, for height of Learning, as well as for choiceneſs of Wit, and ſolidity of Judgment, who are otherwiſe minded, and do hold that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had been both at <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> and at <hi>Laodicea:</hi> accounting it improbable, that he ſhould have gone through <hi>Phrygia</hi> twice, as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50919:83"/>S. <hi>Luke</hi> expreſly teſtifies, and not have ſeen theſe two Cities, the principal ones of that Country. And for theſe words, <hi>and all thoſe which have not ſeen my preſence in the fleſh;</hi> they conceive them added, not to rank the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> with ſuch as had not ſeen the Apoſtle; but quite contrary, to diſtinguiſh and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from them; as if S. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, that he had a great combat, not only for them, but even for thoſe who never ſaw his preſence in the fleſh. But this diſterence being of no great importance at the bottom, and means neceſſary for an exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of it, alſo failing: there is no need we ſhould ſtay to ſolve it; but may leave every one at liberty to take either way of the two; neither of them endamaging the truth of faith, or holineſs of life. And thus we have ſeen, who they were for whom the Apoſtle ſuſtained this great combat which he ſpeaks of.</p>
                     <p>Conſider we now, the combat it ſelf, what it was. I doubt not, but he means thereby, firſt and principally, that care and ſollicitouſneſs and thoughtfulneſs, which the conſideration of theſe Churches drew upon him. For though their faith and conſtancy afforded him much contentment, and encouraged his hope; yet when he caſt his eyes upon the great tentations that ſurrounded them, the hate and perſecutions of the world; the ſeducements and artifices of the falſe teachers; and reflected on the weakneſs of humane nature; he could not but fear, left ſo many things, and thoſe of ſo much force, ſhould debauch them from piety. Love is not without apprehenſion, no not in the greateſt ſafety; how much leſs in the midſt of ſo many dangers? The Apoſtle aſſureth us elſwhere, that the affection he bore to the faithful, was ſo great, that he ſympathiz'd in all their miſeries, and was as if he had ſuffered them himſelf. <hi>The care which I have of all the Churches,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cor. 11.29.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>keeps me beſieged from day to day. Who is weakned, but I am weakned alſo? who is offended, but I alſo burn?</hi> And in the ſame place he repreſents unto us the pain he was in, for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in particular,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.3.</note> 
                        <hi>I fear</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leſt as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtilty, ſo by any means your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity which is in CHRIST.</hi> Juſt the ſame did he apprehend for the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> and <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and other Chriſtians in <hi>Aſia;</hi> even leſt the cheats and crafts of Seducers ſhould diſorder their faith, and make a like ſpoil among them, as they made in the Church of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> as appears by the Epiſtle he wrote them upon this occaſion: Yet theſe juſt fears wherewith the thoughts of the Apoſtle were incumbred, were not his whole combat. For under this word, he compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth alſo, all that he did to divert the danger, which he apprehended. Firſt, he was perpetually in prayer for the ſafety of theſe dear Churches; and as <hi>Moſes,</hi> in elder time upon the mountain, ceas'd not lifting up his hands to the Almighty, for the Victory of his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that was in fight the while with <hi>Amalek.</hi> So this great Apoſtle from that high ſtation, where JESUS CHRIST had ſet him in His Church, did continually preſent his ſupplications, and ſighs to Heaven, for the good ſucceſs of the Combats which his Maſter's troops were engaged in.
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.12. Phil. 1.4. Coloſ. 1.9.</note> 
                        <hi>We pray always for you</hi> (ſaith he). <hi>I ſtill make requeſt for you all, in all my prayers. We ceaſe not to pray for you, and to crave, that you may be filled with the knowledg of the Will of CHRIST, in all wiſdom, and ſpiritual underſtanding.</hi> To Prayer he added Action; couragiouſly attacquing Error on all occaſions; refuting Seducers, and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vanity of their Doctrine, and the malignity of their deſign; not only by word of mouth, but alſo by writing; as we ſee by thoſe divine Epiſtles of his, which remain with us; and in which the evidences of his great earneſtneſs againſt theſe falſe Apoſtles, do appear here and there in many places. And as he laid on ſtoutly upon enemies; ſo did he ſmartly take up the faithful; reproving them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing, and encouraging them to neceſſary firmneſs and conſtancy. He march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo high a generoſity, that he ſpared not S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf; who having ſlipt through weakneſs and complacency into actions which ſeem'd to favour error, <hi>Paul</hi> boldly undertakes him, and ſheweth him his fault, with much liberty, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gives us an account elſewhere. In ſhort,
<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> he omitted none of the duties of a valiant and vigilant Captain, either againſt the foe, or towards his friends and fellow-ſoldiers, as is eaſie to be ſeen by his writings. Yet his combat ſtay'd not here. He often came to blows, cheerfully ſuffering for this cauſe, all the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the rage of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the malice of Seducers did contrive, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50919:84"/>form againſt him. And to ſay the truth, the very chain he was loaden with, and the priſon he was in, when he wrote this Epiſtle, did make up a part of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat of his; it being clear, by the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that nothing had more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed the hatred of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt him, who caſt him into this affliction, than the zeal he ſhewed every where againſt the corruptions of ſuch people as would retain the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law; and hence it is, that he told the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians</hi> afore,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.24.</note> he ſuffered for them; becauſe in effect, and at the bottom, it was for maintaining their liberty, and the liberty of other Gentiles converted to the Goſpel, and for the keeping of their faith pure from all corruptive leaven, that he fell into this tedious ſufferance. Such was <hi>Paul</hi>'s combat for theſe faithful people.</p>
                     <p>Dear Brethren, admire the zeal, and the charity of this ſanctified ſoul. He was in the Priſons of <hi>Nero;</hi> he ſtood, as we may ſay, upon the Scaffold, and had his head on the block; being indicted for a criminal matter, which concerned his life. And even in this eſtate, his heart is in pain for the Churches of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and for thoſe beſide, that had never beheld him. Their danger troubled him, more than his own. Neither priſon nor death was able to extinguiſh or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh his affection; or to make him lay aſide the leaſt of his cares; Having ſo great a Combat againſt his own perſon, upon his hands he leaves it, and on ſo preſſing an occaſion, travelleth, and combateth for others. Certainly, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any thing be imagin'd, more elevated or more ardent than this love. We may truly affirm of it, what is ſaid in the Song of <hi>Solomon, His love is ſtrong as death, and his jealouſie is hard as the grave; it's burnings are burnings of fire, and a flame of GOD; Many waters could not quench it, nor could flouds drown it.</hi> But obſerve again, the prudence and apt procedure of this holy man, in that he repreſenteth theſe things to theſe faithful people for ſo good an end. For being to entertain them with important matters, and to decry errors, which ſeduction did paint over with the deceitful colours of Philoſophy and Eloquence, that he might diſpoſe their hearts to give him due audience, and gain his remonſtrances a neceſſary cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and authority; he ſets before them at the entrance the cares he had for their Salvation; the combats he ſuſtained for them; and all the effects of that ſacred amity he had towards them. As a Captain, who to keep firm his Soldiers in their duty, repreſents to them his watchings, and his pains-taking, and his cares for their preſervation; and in ſum all the marks of his affection to them; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a tender mother, who to withdraw her dear children from giving ear to debauches, ſheweth them her fears, her ſollicitudes, and her alarms; the yearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her bowels, and all that ſhe doth, or ſuffereth for them. Such is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles holy artifice in the preſent buſineſs; and it is grounded upon a maxime we all know; namely, that we much more believe thoſe that love us, and are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate for our welfare, than thoſe to whom we are indifferent. He declareth to them his pains, that they may take in good part his remonſtrances; and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them his paſſion, that they may receive his counſels. His aim is not to draw glory from it, or to enhanſe his eſteem among them; (ſuch a childiſh vanity had no place in the ſoul of this great man) but indeed to render his inſtructions the more effectual to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> thereby. And the Combats which he for the ſame end tells them of, ſhould ſerve in like manner for examples unto us. Let Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel learn by them, what love they owe their flocks; what cares and combats their Office obligeth them to. Let nothing in the world be dearer or more precious to them than the Salvation of the Souls committed to their charge; let them take part in their joys, and in their griefs; let them feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly reſent their wounds, apprehend their dangers, labour inceſſantly for their edification. To it let them conſecrate the thoughts of their mind, and the words of their mouth, and the work of their pen, and the actions of their life; yea, their blood, and life it ſelf, (if there be need) ſaying with clear conſcience, as the Apoſtle in another place doth;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.15.</note> 
                        <hi>As for me I will willingly ſpend, and be ſpent for your ſouls, and be glad to ſerve for an aſperſion upon the ſacrifice and ſervice of your faith.</hi> Let this care and theſe thoughts fill their hearts day and night; let them make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that there is neither affair nor occaſion, nor peril, that diſpenſeth with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50919:84"/>them for the ſame; no not death it ſelf in the very gates whereof they ought to mind ſtill their flock, and combat for them by their prayers and their devout wiſhes. Such is the faithful, the love and the care we owe you. We confeſs that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch watching and ſtriving for your Salvation, we cannot avoid the cenſure, and chaſtiſements of the ſupream Paſtor. Judg, if it be not reaſonable, that you have affection and reſpect for thoſe whom the love of your Salvation engageth to ſo many cares and labours; and if it be not juſt that you receive their inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with reverence, and hearken to the product of their ſtudies with attention; that you comply with the zeal they have for your edification, and attribute much to their counſels, and ſuffer their liberty; and impute to their affection the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their remonſtrances when grief and fear draw from them complaints and crys againſt your carriages; that you conſolate the pains they take for you, by your reſentment of the ſame; and above all by your progreſs in the ſtudious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of piety. For this is the only fruit they crave of all their cares, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats; they would account them moſt advantagiouſly recompenced if you do but profit by them; if they perceive by the goodneſs of your manners, and the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your life, that they have not labored in vain. But do not imagin, I pray, that their ſollicitude doth diſcharge you of all care. On the contrary, it ſheweth you with what earneſtneſs and aſſiduity you ſhould labor for your own Salvation. For if they muſt heed your affairs with ſo much diligence, what zeal ſhould you put forth about them your ſelves? Their travel may awaken and hearten you, but it cannot ſave you except you travel your ſelves. Their combating will win you no Crown if you take not part in it after their example. Every one ſhall live by his own faith, and no perſon be crowned for the zeal of his Paſtor, or his brother. If your Paſtors watch, if they ſtand on their guard, if they labour and combat, bleſſed be GOD they ſhall receive their pay. But their labouring will not excuſe your loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, nor will their heedfulneſs juſtifie you neglects. Every man ſhall bear his own burthen; they may give you the example of their piety, they will not be able to communicate to you the recompences of it. Employ we then our ſelves, both the one and the others, Paſtors and flocks about our Salvation with fear and trembling. Let us all combat with <hi>Paul,</hi> if we will be crowned with him. Imitate we his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if we deſire to partake in his Glory. Let us extend our cares and our love as he did, not only to the ſaithful whom we know, but even to thoſe whom we never ſaw. For carnal amities, I confeſs it is bodily ſight and preſence which enkindles and maintains them. The eyes of the fleſh are the authors and the preſervers of them. But in thoſe of JESUS CHRIST, it is otherwiſe; It's the Spirit that knits them. It is its eye and its ſight, that cauſeth them both to begin, and to continue. For ſince it is properly JESUS CHRIST and His Goſpel, that Charity loveth, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it ought to embrace all thoſe which bear the marks of them, whether they be abſent or preſent. The diſtance of times and places doth not hinder theſe ſacred commerces. The Apoſtle combateth even for thoſe that had never ſeen him. Let us alſo then love all true Chriſtians, and ſpread our affections as far as to thoſe whom many Seas, and many Mountains ſever from us. Let us combate for them by prayer, and do them (how far off ſoever they be from us) all the Offices whereof our Charity ſhall be capable; travelling with holy tenderneſs for the ſalvation and edification of one another.</p>
                     <p>But having conſidered St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s combat, let us now examine the end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it. Whence comes it, holy Apoſtle, that thou takeſt ſo much pains, and haſt theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> and <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and even thoſe that never ſaw thee, ſo neer thy heart? Why doth this carefulneſs follow thee to the very priſon, and come there to aggravate and invenom thy perſonal ſufferings? Why laboureſt thou ſo for them? <hi>To the end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that their hearts may be comforted, they being joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in love, and in all riches of full certainty of underſtanding, unto the knowledg of the ſecret of our GOD, and Father, and of CHRIST.</hi> Thus doth the Apoſtle anſwer our demand. I am in pain (ſaith he) for their conſolation and their faith. I combat to preſerve this treaſure to them, and to prevent the enemies ſnatching out of their hands ſo precious and ſo neceſſary a poſſeſſion. By ſaying, he combats for them, that they may keep theſe Graces, He ſheweth, That they
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50919:85"/>were in danger to loſe them if the enemies they had, that is, the Seducers and falſe Apoſtles, did accompliſh their deſign, and perſwade theſe faithful people to thoſe errors, which they were ſetting forth. In effect it is evident, that their doctrine of man's Juſtification by ceremonies and obſervations, whether legal or humane, is incompatible with the truth of the Goſpel; doth diſturb the comfort of the faithful, break the bond of charity, confoundeth and embroileth the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of JESUS CHRIST; bereaveth Him of His glory, and of His plentifulneſs, repreſenting Him as poor and ſcanty, and as needing the ſuccour, either of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of Philoſophy, and the ſuperſtition of men to give us Salvation. The Apoſtle nameth three things which he wiſheth unto theſe Believers, and which he would keep for them by his cares and combats, Conſolation of heart; Conjunction in charity; and the riches of a full certainty of underſtanding, or as he expreſſeth the ſame thing in other terms, knowledg of the ſecret of our GOD, and Father, and of CHRIST. The firſt of theſe, to wit, Comfort of heart, is the happineſs of the faithful upon earth. For it is that calm and tranquillity which their ſouls en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy amidſt the tempeſts of this life; when they ſweetly repoſe themſelves upon their Maſter's word, and are aſſured to partake of His Salvation, notwithſtanding the menaces and perſecutions of the enemy; and the defects and imperfections of their own courſe. All hereſie and error in Religion doth neceſſarily diſturb this conſolation; becauſe it ſhakes the truth and certainty of the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel upon which it is founded. But the error which the Apoſtle ſets himſelf to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, did particularly ſtrike at this part of our Salvation, depriving conſciences of that peace, which faith in JESUS CHRIST doth afford them; and caſting them into a miſerable agitation, in that it makes their juſtification to depend on, I know not what obſervances that are either vain and unprofitable, or even impious and pernicious. It's this that animates S. <hi>Paul</hi> to combat it ſo vigorouſly every where: becauſe the faithful could not receive it, without loſing their true conſolation; that is, their only hearts-good. And this ſhould make us jealous for the purity of the Goſpel to keep it free from all admixture of error. Let us not hearken unto thoſe who tell us, that if what they have added to the Goſpel do diſpleaſe us, yet we cannot deny but they retain JESUS CHRIST, and the foundations of our Salvation in Him. It is a moſt evident deluſion. I confeſs that JESUS CHRIST giveth Salvation and Conſolation; but He doth it to thoſe that embrace Him, as He preſents Himſelf to us on His Croſs, and in His Goſpel naked, and without adulteration and compoſition. If you will have either vice or ſuperſtition with Him, He will ſerve you for nothing, ſave to augment your condemnation. As food, how good and wholſome ſoever it be, will no leſs then kill you, if it be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with poyſon. We muſt either receive JESUS CHRIST alone, or renounce His Salvation. There is no poſſibility to link Him, either with the world, or with ſuperſtition. And this verity, that our hearts cannot have true and ſolid comfort but in JESUS CHRIST alone, is ſo evident, that error it ſelf when it is preſſed home is conſtrained to acknowledg it. After ſufficient diſpute about the merit of its works, and large boaſt of the worth of its ſatisfactions, and of the value of its Pontifical indulgences,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> of Juſtif. i. 5. c. 7.</note> and of the Interceſſion of its Saints, it confeſſeth that by reaſon of the uncertainty of our own righteouſneſs, the ſafeſt courſe is, to put all our confidence in the ſole mercy of GOD. In other caſes which concern our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement only, I think a man may ſometimes without blame chuſe the longeſt and moſt hazardous way. In the caſe of our Salvation it is an exceſs of folly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt not to take the ſafeſt. Since by your own confeſſion, my doctrine, or rather the doctrine of the Goſpel is the ſafer, ſuffer me to hold to it, and to pity your imprudence, who do amuſe the world with that which your ſelf confeſs to have leſs of ſafety and more of hazard in it.</p>
                     <p>But I return to the Apoſtle, who having ſaid, <hi>That he combateth for theſe faithful people, that their hearts might be comforted;</hi> addeth in the ſecond place, <hi>they being joined together in charity.</hi> Their Seducers troubled their Union, and caſting in a new doctrine among them as a matter of contention, ruined their fraternal concord, as much as in them lay; drawing them into diverſity of minds, from whence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth contrariety of affections: It is therefore alſo for the preventing of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50919:85"/>and for the preſerving of union in charity among them, that the Apoſtle had ſo great a conflict. For as the Sea abideth peaceable and united during a calm, but riſeth all in waves that violently daſh on one another, when the wind begins to bluſter. So falſe teachers which are as the winds and guſts of hell, do no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fall upon a Church but they diſturb its peace, and put all the members of it in commotion; parting them aſunder, mutinying them, and making them miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably claſh with each other to their common ruin, and the joy of their enemy. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us here that the mutual conjunction of the faithful in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is neceſſary for the conſolation of their hearts; <hi>to the end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that their hearts may be comforted, they being joined together in love.</hi> Indeed what joy and what comfort can a good ſoul have in the trouble of diviſion? Conſidering withal, that JESUS CHRIST, who is the only ſource of our joy, doth not communicate Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to any, but ſuch as have a true charity; who abide conjoin'd in his body by the Lands of one and the ſame fame and love. In fine, the third benefit which the Apoſtle deſireth to preſerve among the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> and their Neighbours, is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding of a full and an aſſured knowledg of the myſtery of GOD, <hi>being joined in charity, and in all riches of certainty of underſtanding in the knowledg of our GOD, and Father, and of CHRIST.</hi> This order is well worth the noting. For theſe three things which he hath ranked together here, are of ſuch a nature, that the firſt depends upon the ſecond, and the ſecond upon the third: Conſolation upon union in charity, and union in charity upon knowledg. This laſt is as the firſt degree, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which charity is rais'd up; and charity as the ſecond which ſuſtaineth the third, to wit, Conſolation. Of theſe three Jewels one cannot be had without the other. And as the conſolation of the LORD cannot be enjoy'd without the ſweetneſſes of charity; ſo charity cannot be had without the lights of knowledg. But the Apoſtle doth not ſimply name that knowledg which he deſireth in the faithful; He deſcribes it in ſtately manner as he is wont; and intimateth, as he proceeds, the principal qualities it ought to have, which he briefly compriſeth in theſe words, <hi>all the riches of full certainty of underſtanding,</hi> that is, to expreſs this <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe, in the idiom of our own language, <hi>all abundance of underſtanding, with full aſſurance and ſatisfaction.</hi> He would have therefore firſt that the knowledg of a Chriſtian be underſtanding; that is, that he do perceive and ſee in the clearneſs of coeleſtial light thoſe verities which GOD hath revealed to us; not that we are bound to comprehend them all, and penetrate the nature of them to the bottom; (for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt of them Divine and Supernatural, this is impoſſible for us) but that we ought to know what is revealed to us of them: becauſe otherwiſe we ſhould be in danger every moment to be deluded, and to take the vain traditions of men, for things taught of GOD. Whence appears how far that hood-winkt faith wherewith our adverſaries do content themſelves, is from the knowledg of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. This faith if interrogated about Evangelical truth, refers it ſelf to the Church in it, being ignorant all the while of what it believes, and conſequently having no ſpark of underſtanding. Black is not more contrary to white, nor dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light than this fantaſm of faith (ſhall I ſay) or of ignorance, to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which the Apoſtle here requireth in us. He would have the faithful to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent; and theſe people underſtand nothing at all; nay do boaſt of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, imagining that it is not without merit. It is therefore the faith not of a Chriſtian; away with ſuch a thought; nor of the Collier, as they call it; no, nor of a man indued with reaſon: but the faith of a brute which hath no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſings. Secondly, the Apoſtle willeth that we have not meerly underſtanding, but riches, yea all riches of underſtanding; that is, a great and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect abundance of knowledg; that we be rich in this kind of wealth, that we be ignorant of none of the myſteries of Divine truth; that we know not the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the firſt maxims of it only, but all the inferences that are neceſſary to guide our lives, and to guard us from the ambuſhes of Satan, amid which we go, Otherwiſe how ſhall we diſcern the voice of the chief Shepherd from the voice of a ſtranger; to fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50919:86"/>thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> is, who licenſe their people to be ignorant; and do blame ſuch, as not contenting themſelves with the firſt and plaineſt leſſons of Chriſtianity, do ſtudy the bottom of this ſaving wiſdom; outragiouſly decrying this laudable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as if it were the way to hereſie and hell. Finally S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have this intelligentneſs of a Believer to be beſides its abounding with an entire certainty and aſſurance; making uſe of a word which he often puts to ſignifie a full and an aſſured perſwaſion, when we hold things which we believe to be ſure and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable. For though matters of faith be not laid open either to the ſenſes, or the reaſon of men; yet the truth of them is ſo evident, ſo beautiful, and ſo well marked that as ſoon as the clouds of thoſe paſſions and prejudices which hide it from us are removed from before the eyes of our underſtanding by the hand of the holy Spirit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whereby you ſee, how falſe the opinion of <hi>Rome</hi> is, which makes the belief of Chriſtianity to depend upon the authority and teſtimony of her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. I paſs by the extream weakneſs and vanity of this pretended foundation, which hath been verify'd by a thouſand experiments. Whatever it be in other reſpects, this is manifeſt, that ſince they faſten the people's knowledg there, they muſt of neceſſity confeſs, that their faith ought to change if any change do happen in the doctrine of their Prelates; whence it follows that then it is not certain, nor aſſured, nor ſuch a knowledg as the Apoſtle requireth in us; whoſe property is ſuch, that though <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf or Angels from heaven ſhould come and preach the contrary it would abide not withſtanding, even under ſuch a ſuppoſal, ſtill firm and unmoved; and rather anathematize Apoſtles and Angels from heaven, than let go that Divine verity which it hath believed and known; ſo ſtrong is the ſenſe it hath of its excellency.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle having thus deſcribed the nature of true faith, or a Chriſtian's underſtanding, doth laſtly confine it within the bounds of its true ſubject, when he adds, <hi>the knowledg of the Secret of our God and Father, and of Chriſt.</hi> This reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is neceſſary; becauſe ſeducers do boaſt of their traditions too, as if they were a piece of wiſdom, worthy of our faith; and it may not be doubted, but that the falſe teachers againſt whom the Apoſtle intends to diſpute did deal in ſuch manner. To arm us againſt their vanity he declares expreſly that the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he requireth of us is a knowledg not of what Philoſophers do talk in their Schools about the nature of the world; nor of what Seducers do bring forth, from their vain imaginations, but only of the Goſpel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST; without which there is nothing but error and folly. He calls it a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret or a Myſtery, becauſe it was a verity hidden with GOD, and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to our minds, as we have ſaid otherwhere. He ſaith, <hi>that it is the Secret of GOD our Father,</hi> both becauſe He is the Author of it, who hath reveal'd it to us of His Grace; and becauſe He hath manifeſted Himſelf therein, diſcovering to us in the Goſpel all that we need to know of His nature and will for attaining to Salvation. He adds in the end, <hi>and of CHRIST,</hi> for the ſame reaſons; it being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that it is the LORD JESUS who brought this holy doctrine from the boſom of the Father, and ſet it in our view, by the Miniſtry of His Servants; and that alſo it is He, who is the principal Subject of it, as our only Mediator, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe conduct and merit it is impoſſible to have any part in true happineſs. Its of this myſtery of CHRIST JESUS, that the Apoſtle deſired the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might have a full, firm, and diſtinct knowledg for to abide knit together by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and by this means enjoy a true and ſolid conſolation.

There are in it deeps to exerciſe and humble the greateſt Spirits; there are facilities to inſtruct and content the leaſt. It is an abyſs where Elephants may ſwim, and a ſhallow where Lambs may wade. But as all are capable of this ſcience, ſo there is no perſon but it is neceſſary for. It's the key of the Kingdom of heaven, the ſpring of piety, the root of ſanctity, the ſeed of true life. Study it carefully. Hearken to the teaching of it here, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on it at home with deep intentiveneſs; beſeeching GOD with prayers and tears to open your hearts and write His doctrine in them. Content not your ſelves with having learned ſome points of it. Take no reſt till you know all its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; till you have attained not ſimply underſtanding, but all riches of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh. Urge not to me that vain and cold excuſe, which is in the mouths of many, that you are not Miniſters, and therefore need not be ſo knowing. Theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were Miniſters no more than you; and yet you ſee, what the Apoſtle doth deſire for them; and afterwards he will enjoyn, that the word of CHRIST do dwell plenteouſly in them in all wiſdom. Why? are you leſs expoſed to temptations for your not being Miniſters? are the Devil, and the World leſs ardent, or leſs obſtinate in ſetting upon you? We are all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the ſame war, and have all need of the ſame arms. Is it Captains only and Officers that ought to be armed? Is it not neceſſary for private Soldiers? The knowledg of the Myſteries of the Goſpel is the armor of all Chriſtians; and the Scripture is the publick Magazine, whence both one and the others ſhould fetch it. But that it may do you ſervice at your need, this knowledg muſt be alſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly radicated in your hearts; you muſt have it with a full aſſurance (as the Apoſtle ſaith). It ſhould not ſleightly float in your head, to be pluckt away by an enemy, on the firſt occaſion; It muſt be engraven on your heart with a pen of iron, and the point of a diamond; that is, you ſhould be ſo firmly perſwaded of it, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be able to efface it and enfeeble your belief of it. I know well every one boaſteth to be ſo. But there is a great difference between words and things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Shew it me by your lives, and I will credit it. If you be fully perſwaded of the truth of the Goſpel, How is it, that you have not the charity which it ſo neceſſarily commandeth us? How do you hate men whom it commandeth you to love; and love the vices which it enjoyneth you to hate? Let us lay by words, and poſſeſs in deed, that full certainty of underſtanding which the Apoſtle wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us. This is the true way for us to abide all joyned together in charity; to conflict with, and overcome our enemies; to edifie and preſerve our friends; to attract thoſe that are without; to retain thoſe that are within; to enjoy much conſolation in all the trials of this world, and to obtain in the end the Salvation, and the glory of the other, through the grace of our LORD and Saviour JESUS CHRIST. To whom with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, the true and only GOD, be all honour, praiſe, and glory to ages of ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>

<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> And as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the rulers of the <hi>Jews, that if they had known the true wiſdom, they would never have crucify'd the LORD of Glory:</hi> So may we ſay of the authors of all the falſe and pernicious Doctrines which men have luſted to introduce into Religion; that if they had duly known JESUS CHRIST, they would not have ever troubled the Church. I paſs by the ſcourges of the firſt ages, the impiety of the <hi>Arrians</hi> and the <hi>Dokites;</hi> the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy of the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> together with the numberleſs bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the one and the others; they all evidently ſprung from ignorance of the true being of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and ſtrike directly at Him, ruining either His natures, by attributing to Him, the one a created and imperfect Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the others an imaginary and phantaſtique Humanity; or His Perſon, ſome of them dividing, others confounding the natures which are united in it. From the ſame original its clear, have come thoſe abuſes and diſorders which had the vogue in the following ages, and which raiſing themſelves by little and little, from weak and obſcure beginnings have at laſt got a ſuperiority and ſuffocated the genuine ſimplicity and verity of the Goſpel. Hence proceeded that invocation of Saints, which is at this day practiſed throughout all the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion. Hence hath iſſued that ſecond ſacrifice which they call of the Altar, and wherein the heart of Religion is made to conſiſt. If men had rightly known the excellency of our LORD's mediation, and the effectual extent of His Croſs, they would never have addreſs'd them to any other Interceſſor, never have had recourſe to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oblation. From the ſaid ignorance alſo as from a common ſpring of error, have flowed in among people, ſatisfactions and merits of condignity, and congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and indulgences, and the rules and odly various Diſciplines of Monks, and in ſumm all Superſtitions. If people had well known what an one JESUS CHRIST is, they would have been aſſuredly content with His Satisfaction, and with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite merit, and with that eternal indulgence which He hath purchas'd for all that believe, and with the perfection of His Goſpel. Hence again hath come the ſetting up of another Head in the militant Church, to be there as the Vicar and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor of JESUS CHRIST. If this JESUS whom the Father hath given over all things for an Head to the Church, if the fulneſs of His power, and of His wiſdom, and His infinite love had been well known, never had this ſecond Monarchy been erected in His Kingdom.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50919:87"/>wiſdom and knowledg.</hi> In theſe few words there is a great deal of ſenſe and truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore we will employ this whole exerciſe in the explaining of them to you if GOD permit; noting, in order all that ſhall ſeem to us neceſſary, both for the underſtanding of the Text, and for the inſtruction and edification of your Souls.</p>
                     <p>I know well that the relative word, <hi>whom,</hi> is in the Original indifferently, <hi>whom</hi> or <hi>which;</hi> and may be referred either to JESUS CHRIST, or to the Myſtery of GOD, whereof he ſpake juſt before; if referred to the latter, it is as if he had ſaid, that in this Myſtery are hidden all the treaſures of wiſdom; and I deny not but the words ſo conſtrued do make a veritable ſenſe; it being certain that our LORD's Goſpel here called, <hi>His myſtery,</hi> is an inexhauſtible treaſury of all ſaving wiſdom and knowledg. But it is not needful to come to this; and in my mind its more pertinent and more fluent to refer this word to the Name of CHRIST, which immediately preceded, and to account the Apoſtle's meaning is, that in JESUS CHRIST are hid theſe treaſures which he doth intend. Yet at the bottom as you ſhall ſee, the ſenſe is the ſame, which way ſoever of the two, you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. And for a right conceiving of it, we muſt firſt refute the expoſition which ſome do give of this Text, and then aſſert the true meaning. There are ſome that take theſe words as if <hi>Paul</hi> would ſay, that JESUS CHRIST knoweth all things, and hath ſo rich and ſo abundant a knowledg, that He is ignorant of nothing. It's a miſtaking of the Apoſtle's intention in this place. But that which they add is yet worſe. For from this ill interpretation they infer a falſe and a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous doctrine; concluding, from our Saviour's having all the treaſures of Knowledg, that the infinite wiſdom of His Divinity, was really transfuſed into His humane nature; and by conſequent all the other properties alſo of the Divine nature; as its omnipotency, its infiniteneſs, and its preſence in all places; ſince there is the ſame reaſon for all theſe attributes of GOD, and they are ſo in ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that none can have one of them, without poſſeſſing of the reſt. See, I pray you, how fruitful error is, and how truly it was ſaid by one of the ancient Sages of the world, That one falſity and abſurdity being ſuppoſed, many others do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow upon it! For that which hath led, or to ſay better which hath drawn theſe authors into this long ſeries of errors, is nothing but a falſe opinion, which they have about the Sacrament of the Euchariſt. They incommodiouſly and unreaſonably ſuppoſe that the fleſh of JESUS CHRIST is really preſent in the bread: And this abſurdity hath engaged them by little and little in thoſe others that are ſo much worſe. For not being able to reliſh that Tranſubſtantion, which thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> make uſe of to uphold this real preſence of our LORD's body, and deſervedly rejecting it, as full of abſurdities and contradictions; yet bent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own bad preſuppoſition, they have had recourſe for the maintaining of it to another, well nigh as great an error, namely, that of Ubiquity, and do affirm that the body of JESUS CHRIST is every where preſent, and conſequently in the Euchariſtical ſignes; and to defend a thing ſo ſtrange and ſo contrary to ſenſe, to reaſon, and to Scripture, they have advanced this conceit, that the fleſh of CHRIST through its Perſonal union with the Divinity, hath really receiv'd all the properties thereof; that is, that the Son aſſuming it unto Himſelf hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it omnipotent, immenſe and infinite; a thing which hath induced them to corrupt divers paſſages of the Word of GOD, that they might form out of them ſome prop for their error. It is not the place here to make a thorough refutation of their doctrine, nor to lament at large ſuch perſons their deſerting of the truth in this particular, who are illuminated with the beams thereof in others. Would to GOD we might bury a fault which hath cauſed ſo much ſcandal in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in eternal oblivion! I will only touch at the concernment of the Text in hand, and their abuſe of it, for the favouring of their opinion. I ſay then, that in this ratiocination of theirs. they commit two notable faults; the one, that they do not take the Apoſtle's meaning aright; and the other that they conclude wrong. And to begin at the latter of theſe, they conclude wrong; for from the being of an infinite ſcience and knowledg in JESUS CHRIST it doth not follow that the Soul of His humane nature underſtandeth, and knoweth all the things
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50919:88"/>that God knoweth; as from the being of an eternal Divinity in JESUS CHRIST, it no way followeth that His fleſh is an eternal Divinity; or from His having cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the World, that his Fleſh created it; like as (if at leaſt we may compare Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things with Divine) from a man's having in him an immortal intellect, it follows not at all that his body is intelligent, or immortal. For as in Man there are two Subſtances, the Soul and the Body; which, though united in the ſame ſubject do nevertheleſs conſerve each of them their Properties apart; the Soul its ſpiritualneſs and inviſibility; the Body likewiſe its viſibility and palpableneſs; the one a capacity to underſtand and will, the other not; after the ſame manner, there are two natures in JESUS CHRIST, which though perſonally united, yet are not mingled or confuſed one with the other. But retain each of them their eſſential and original qualities; in ſuch ſort that the Divine nature abideth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, infinite, omnipotent and omniſcient; and the humane created in time; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in place, and endowed with a limited ſtrength, power, and ſcience. Now as when we ſay of man in general, that there is underſtanding and ſenſe in him; that he hath a viſible or inviſible eſſence; that he is mortal or immortal: each of theſe attributions ought to be underſtood, in reference to that part of his nature, to which it agreeth, and not be confuſedly applied to them both; So, if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſaid (as I grant, he truly might) that there is in JESUS CHRIST an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power or knowledg, it ſhould be referred to His Divinity, and not to His Humanity. For JESUS CHRIST being very GOD bleſſed for ever with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who doubts but that in this regard, He is omnipotent and omniſcient? But thence it follows not that He is ſo in regard of His humane nature too. And for any to deduce it from that attribution is as impertinent reaſoning, as if, becauſe there is in JESUS CHRIST a fleſh conceived and born of the Bleſſed Virgin, and which was infirm and crucified; you would inferr, that therefore His Divinity was alſo born of the Holy Virgin, and that it too was faſtned to the Croſs. But though it ſhould be granted them, that all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg are hid in the humane ſoul of JESUS CHRIST, yet ſtill they would conclude wrong, to infer thence as they do, that the knowledg of His Soul is infinite, and the ſame with that of GOD. We confeſs that this bleſſed Soul having had the honour to be perſonally united with the Eternal Son of GOD, hath alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon been adorned with all the ſhining light of knowledg, and wiſdom, whereof its nature is capable; ſo as it may be ſaid in this reſpect that all the treaſures of them are hidden in it; and that the knowledg which it hath of things doth much ſurpaſs the knowledg of Men and Angels, both for its extent, and alſo for its clearneſs and firmneſs. Yet the nature of the ſubject wherein it properly reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, being finite, it ſelf is alſo neceſſarily finite; whereas the knowledg of the Father, and of His eternal Word, is infinite, even as the nature of the one, and the other is infinite. And it is to no purpoſe to reply, that by this accompt, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of JESUS CHRIST will have no advantage above the Saints; of whom it may be ſaid in this ſenſe, that all the treaſures of wiſdom are hidden in them, ſince GOD, who dwelleth in them hath an infinite knowledg and wiſdom. For this conſequence is evidently falſe. Firſt, by reaſon of the extream difference which is found between the graces communicated to the Saints, and the gifts of light and knowledg that are inſuſed into the Soul of our Saviour. Secondly, by reaſon of the infinite difference that is between their perſons; for though GOD do dwell in the Saints by His grace; yet no one of the Saints is GOD; whereas the Eternal Word ſo dwelleth in the humanity of JESUS CHRIST, that the ſame one who is man is alſo truly GOD; theſe two natures being ſo ſtrictly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they are but one only, and the ſame perſon: by means whereof, it may be rightly ſaid, that if the Word of the Father be almighty and eternal, as indeed it is, omnipotency and eternity, and infiniteneſs are in JESUS CHRIST; (for He is truly the Word of the Father) but it cannot be inferred, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> (for example) or S. <hi>Paul</hi> had in them an infinite power or wiſdom, becauſe GOD dwelled in them; for that GOD dwelt not perſonally in them, (that is, ſo as each of them was GOD) but only by the grace of His Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I add in the ſecond place, that all this diſpute is beſide the Apoſtle's
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50919:88"/>ſcope, whoſe meaning they have miſapprehended. For his intention here is not to ſpeak of what JESUS CHRIST knoweth, What would this conduce to the end he hath propoſed to Himſelf, namely, the confirming of us in the Goſpel, and the fortifying of us againſt thoſe traditions, and ſpeculations, which falſe teachers would add to it, that we might reject them, and content our ſelves with this JESUS CHRIST, whom the Father preſenteth to us in His word? Who ſees not that the Knowledg which our LORD hath of things that He knoweth in Himſelf, is altogether extraneous to this purpoſe? For the thing in queſtion is, what we muſt know to ſerve GOD aright, and be ſaved in the ſequel. But JESUS CHRIST revealeth not unto us in the Goſpel all that He knoweth either as GOD, or as man. And ſo from His knowing all things, it followeth not that it is enough for us to embrace His Goſpel. For (will the falſe Teachers ſay) though He know all for His own part, yet He hath not diſcover'd in the Goſpel which His Apoſtles do preach unto us, all that is neceſſary for us to believe, or to practiſe. What then (you will ſay) is the true ſenſe of theſe words? Dear Brethren, it is not hard to diſcern if you afford ever ſo little attention to the thing. The Apoſtle conſiders the LORD JESUS here, not ſimply and abſolutely; but ſo as He is ſet forth and revealed to us in His Goſpel; as far as He is the ſubject of the Apoſtle's preaching, and the object of our faith. It's in this reſpect he ſaith, that all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg are hid in Him; thereby ſignifying, that this CHRIST, who is preſent to us in the Goſpel, is an object ſo rich, and ſo divine, as He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all the matter of wiſdom in Him; that all the verities, whereof it is compoſed are found fully and abundantly in Him; ſo as for the having of true wiſdom, there is no need of ſtudying any thing but CHRIST alone; we need but know Him, and ſhall be ignorant of nothing. As if I ſhould ſay, that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom, or natural ſcience, are hid in the world; my meaning would be, not that the world knoweth the things and verities which appertain unto this ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but that it doth contain them; that it is a theatre whereon they are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to our view; and an object by the contemplation whereof we may acquire and learn them. And as if I ſhould ſay, that Man is the treaſury of all the knowledg of living Creatures; I ſhould underſtand thereby, not what man knoweth of them, but what he exhibiteth of it, being as an exact model and patern, of all that the nature of living Creatures comprehends; ſo as by careful ſtudying and meditating him, all that may be known of them may be drawn forth. In this very manner, the Apoſtle ſaying, <hi>that in Chriſt are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg;</hi> doth ſhew us what is the knowledg, not that CHRIST hath in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but which He can give to us; not what He knoweth, but what He maketh us to know; He being as it were an abyſs of wonders, wherein are found all the riches of that heavenly truth, in the knowledg whereof true wiſdom conſiſteth. From whence the inference he aims to make upon it doth clearly flow, namely, that we ought to ſhut our ear againſt any other doctrine, how plauſible, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſoever it be. For ſince JESUS CHRIST is the Magazin, and the treaſury of all wiſdom, in whom is found all that we ought to know, not only for neceſſity, but even unto plenty; who ſeeth not but that it is an extream folly for men to turn themſelves another way, or trouble their heads about the ſtudy of any other object? And ſo this wiſdom, and this knowledg, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, is not that cogniſance which the LORD hath of the things He knoweth, either as GOD, or as Man; but it is that knowledg of Divine things which we have need of, for our attaining to Salvation, and in the having whereof, the true perfection of our nature doth conſiſt. And when he ſaith, that the treaſures of this wiſdom are hid in Him, his meaning is not, that theſe Divine things are known unto our LORD; (ſuch a conception would be frigid and impertinent,) but that they are all diſplayed, and ſet forth in Him; that they dwell in Him, that they are found there; that they are encloſed, and to be ſeen in Him, through the veil of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of His Croſs, which in a manner hideth and overſpreads them. This is, in my opinion, the true and genuine ſenſe of the Apoſtle's expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Let us now examine each of the terms of it, which are all of them wondrous elegant and rich; and afterwards conſider the truth of them. Firſt, he calleth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50919:89"/>this wiſdom and knowledg which is in JESUS CHRIST, Treaſures, to intimate, both the Excellency, and the Abundance of them; the word Treaſure, importing both the one and the other. For, as you know we properly call ſuch a collection, a treaſure, as is of things not worthleſs, and of no value; as duſt or chaſſ; but precious and exquiſite; as gold and ſilver, and precious ſtones, and jewels. But beſides worth, this term ſignifieth abundance alſo. For you will not ſay, that that man hath a treaſure, who hath but two or three pieces of gold, or ſilver, or a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, or four or five Emeralds. To have a treaſure, is to have a great and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable maſs of rare and precious things. And hereby the Verities which JESUS CHRIST exhibits, and affords us the knowledg of, are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe which are found otherwhere. Perhaps a good number of knowledges will be found otherwhere, but they are unprofitable, and of no value. They do not make a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This worthy title appertaineth only to things rare and precious. But the Verities which JESUS CHRIST teacheth thoſe that ſtudy Him, are ſo many pearls of ineſtimable price; they are divine jewels, ſuch as neither the barbarous Sea coaſts, nor the Mines of the new World do yield; ſuch as neither the Heavens nor the Earth, nor any of the ſtore-houſes of Nature can furniſh us with. But abundance alſo is in the matter before us, as well as worth. I deny not, but that ſome of theſe precious Verities are hid in the world, and in man himſelf; and that by attention and meditation, they may be thence drawn out; as appears by what the Pagans had learned, who read no other book. I grant moreover, that the ancient Tabernacle of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſes</hi> afforded a yet greater ſtore; But what is all this, in compariſon of that abundance of them, which JESUS CHRIST preſenteth us? Certainly there's none but He (to ſay true) in whom this Divine treaſure is found. And for the fuller diſcovery of the unmeaſurable abundance of His inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible riches to us, the Apoſtle contents not himſelf with calling it a treaſure. He ſayes treaſures in the plural, ſo great and vaſt is the opulency of this Divine ſubject. Yea, he ſaith not ſimply treaſures, but all the treaſures; to ſhew us, that there is nothing fair, or exquiſite, or precious, but is found in Him.</p>
                     <p>Now S <hi>Paul</hi> ſubjoineth in the progreſs of His ſpeech what thoſe treaſures be, which are in CHRIST. <hi>The treaſures</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of wiſdom and knowledg.</hi> Away ye covetous, who never hear ſpeak of treaſures, but do fancy thoſe of the world; which (to ſay the truth) are but piles of dung, heaps of clods of earth, a little otherwiſe formed and coloured than other parts of this vile and low element be. The jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> which the treaſury of JESUS CHRIST is full of, is of an infinitely more precious nature than the metals you adore; <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>wiſdom and knowledg.</hi> The term, wiſdom, is honourable among men; and though they are ignorant of the thing, nevertheleſs they reſpect the name of it; confeſſing that it properly agreeth only to ſuch knowledges as are at once both ſublime and uſeful, divine and ſalutiferous. Surely, to ſtick in this definition which themſelves give of it, it is clear, that not one of all the Sciences that they have learned in the world by the ſtrength of their own ſpirit, doth deſerve to be call'd wiſdom. For either they are low, and of things of ſmall elevation, as the skill of their trades, which have no employment but on the earth; or at leaſt they are vain, and unprofitable, as that which they tell us of the Heavens, and their motions; of nature, and its mutations; of numbers and figures, and the meaſuring of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. For what ſervice doth that ſcience do them, whereof they vaunt, with ſo much inſolence? Are they any whit the happier for it, or ought the more aſſured by it? Themſelves do vilifie it, when they are in a good mood, and confeſs, that all of it yields thoſe that excell moſt in it, but a very ſlender profit. Will you call an uſeleſs induſtry, Sapience; and count him a wiſe man that buſieth himſelf to no purpoſe? On the contrary, is it not the character of a fool, to amuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in things of nought, and toil about that which affords him no benefit, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that run after their ſhadow, and courſe butter-flies? What is the wiſdom then which is truly worthy of ſo glorious a name? Dear Brethren, it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the knowledg of Verities neceſſary to our Salvation; thoſe Verities that can make us happy, and conſerve peace and conſolation in our Souls, and conduct us through the accidents of this life to the poſſeſſion of that ſupream felicity which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50919:89"/>all men naturally deſire. It's this kind of knowledg that the Apoſtle meaneth here. Its this which by way of excellence, he calleth wiſdom; as alone deſerving the name, while all other kinds of knowledg do lie far beneath it. As for Science, which he doth adjoin, I think we need not ſtrive to ſever it from Sapience; as if they muſt neceſſarily be two different things. I know well, there are they that ſubtilly diſtinguiſh them; ſome affirming, that Sapience is the knowledg of GOD, and of things divine. Science, the knowledg of Man, and of things humane. Others reſolving, that Sapience ſignifies the knowledg of things to be believed, and Science of things to be done. But not to diſſemble I much doubt, whether the Apoſtle ever thought upon theſe petty ſubtilities: For the word Science in the Original generally ſignifies all knowledg, and there is no reaſon to reſtrain it to the knowledg of things either humane or moral. I judg it therefore more accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant with the ſimplicity of theſe Divine Authors, to take the words, Sapience and Science, in well nigh the ſame ſenſe; and to ſay, that the latter was added, only to enlarge and enrich one and the ſame conception; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, that there is neither Sapience nor Science, nor any true and Saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but it is in our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>In fine, it muſt be obſerved, that he ſaith, Theſe treaſures are hid in CHRIST. This is a very apt proſecution of his metaphor. For treaſures are not expoſed to every one's view. They are lockt up in ſome cloſe cabinet; and many times thoſe that have them, hide them in remote places, or lay them under ground to keep off the eyes and hands of men from them. Foraſmuch as this is uſually done, the Apoſtle hath very gracefully uſed this word in the matter before him; and the more gracefully, for that ſomething ſemblable may be obſerv'd in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of JESUS CHRIST. Not that GOD hath any ſuch deſign as avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men have; or that He, fearing leſt people ſhould ſee and ſeize His treaſure, hath directly hid it from them, to prevent their ſharing it. Far be it from us to entertain a thought ſo injurious to the goodneſs and liberality of this Soveraign LORD, who ſent not His Son into the world, but to ſave the world; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in nothing more than in ſeeing us ſearch into His treaſuries, and enrich our ſelves with His good things. Who likewiſe hath clearly and magnificently laid forth in His CHRIST all His heavenly wealth; by reaſon whereof that Son of His is called the Sun of Righteouſneſs; that is, the moſt viſible, and moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable object in the Univerſe. He hath ſent His Servants every way to diſcover Him unto Mankind; and from the tops of the higheſt places to call all men to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of this treaſure of light. Now both His brightneſs, and their voice hath ſpread abroad ſo gloriouſly, that it may be juſtly ſaid, <hi>Light hath been in the world,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 1.10.</note> 
                        <hi>but the world perceived it not.</hi> Wherefore our Apoſtle ſaith elſwhere, <hi>That if his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel be yet hid, it is hid to them that are loſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>and whoſe underſtandings the GOD of this world hath blinded,</hi> (to wit, the unbelieving) <hi>that the light of the Goſpel of the glory of CHRIST might not ſhine into them.</hi> Where you ſee he attributes all the fault of worldlings not diſcerning the excellency of this treaſure to their own blindneſs, cauſed by the darknings and malice of Satan; and not to the obſcurity, or hidden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the treaſure it ſelf; which he gives a quite contrary name to, calling it light, yea, a glorious light, that is to ſay, great and ſparkling. Why then ſaith he, that the treaſures of wiſdom are hid in Him? whereas it ſeemeth, he ſhould ſay on the contrary, that they are manifeſted in Him? that they ſhine out, and appear clearly in Him? I anſwer, that the one and the other may be ſaid, in divers reſpects. For if you conſider the thing in its ſelf, the treaſures of wiſdom are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to us in JESUS CHRIST; and there is no purifyed Soul, but ſees them in Him, and acknowledgeth them immediately, when it views Him, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel repreſents Him. But if you have reſpect to the eyes and perceptions of men, as they naturally are, even obſcured and corrupted by Sin; I confeſs, it's hard for them to diſcern in JESUS CHRIST the riches of wiſdom and knowledg which the Father hath put in Him; and that this proceeds in part from that veil of meanneſs and infirmity, wherewith He is as it were covered all over. And this makes S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay elſwhere, that CHRIST crucified, whom He preached, was to the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſtumbling block, and to the <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſhneſs; though to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50919:90"/>who were called, He was the Power and the Wiſdom of GOD. Therefore it being neceſſary for our Salvation, that He ſhould be born, and live poorly on earth, and there ſuffer in the end the death of the Croſs which ſurpaſſed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for cruelty and ignominy; the Father who ſent Him in this form, cloath'd with this ſad and ſhameful mantle, that aſſrighteth men hath, both manifeſted and hidden His treaſures in Him. He hath manifeſted them in Him: ſince it is in Him, and by Him, that He exhibiteth to us whatſoever we ought to know for the attainment of Salvation: He hath hidden them in Hun; ſince He hath covered this treaſure with ſuch a veil, as by its poor and contemptible look, diſcourageth men, and makes them ſay, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> prophecyed, <hi>He hath no form nor comelineſs in Him, and when we ſee Him there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire Him.</hi> But they which have their eyes purified by light from on high, do diſcern under this appearing ſimplicity and humility, all coeleſtial riches in their ſtatelieſt and moſt glorious form. This is the Apoſtle's meaning here, when he ſaith, that theſe treaſures are hid in CHRIST. He advertiſeth us, that we muſt not ſtop at that infirmity and emptineſs which appeareth at firſt ſight in Him; and diſguſteth vain, and earthly ſpirits; but look within, and contemplate the great wonders which GOD hath there manifeſted for our compleat inſtruction and conſolation.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have examin'd the words of this Text. It remaineth, that we now conſider the truth in it. We ſhall do it but ſummarily. For the proſecution of this rich ſubject in its whole extent, is above the ability of Man, or Angel, to be worthily performed; ſo great is the heighth and depth of it. But we will briefly touch its chief heads. Mans true wiſdom in his preſent ſtate is to know His miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with the means to eſcape; it and his felicity, with the way that he muſt take to attain it. As for our miſery, nature indeed hath given us ſome perception of it, there being ſcarce a man in the world who ſees not ſome depravation and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in himſelf; and whoſe conſcience doth not reproach him with his faults and threaten the judgment of a ſupream juſtice. The Law hath taught us much more of it, repreſenting GOD unto us as armed with inexorable ſeverity againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and fulminating his curſe upon them. But beſide that theſe knowledges are weak, and are eaſily ſmothered in ſecurity, there is this ſorrow with them, that having ſhewed us our miſery, they do not inform us of the remedy; ſo as if they be neceſſary to draw us out of that folly, wherein the moſt are plunged, (who confidently ſleep amid the tempeſt, and preſume they are well, while they have a mortal impoſtume in their brain, or in their bowels) yet it cannot be ſaid, that they ſuffice to make us wiſe; ſeeing that for the juſt poſſeſſion of this title, a man muſt know not only his malady, but alſo the means to cure it. And yet though we knew it too, nevertheleſs this would not be ſufficient; becauſe, beſides deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from evil, we deſire alſo the fruition of good, yea the chief Good. But neither the light of nature, nor even the light of the Law does reveal to us, what this ſupream felicity is, which without diſtinct knowing it, we do deſire; ſo far are they from ſhewing us the way to it. But in JESUS CHRIST as propoſed to us in the Goſpel, theſe Verities that are neceſſary to render us wiſe, are found clearly and fully all of them. For as to our miſery, He declareth it exactly to us, not by ſome ſurd and inarticulate ſounds, as nature doth; nor by circuitions and eſſaies, as the Law did; but by the fulleſt and moſt moving way of information that ever was in the world; even crying aloud to us from that Croſs, to which our ſins had nailed Him. Behold ye ſons of men how horrid your crimes are, ſince that it was neceſſary for the waſhing them away, that I ſhould come down from the Heavens, &amp; ſhed forth my blood. Behold, how great &amp; irreparable your fall was, ſince there was none in heaven or earth, that could raiſe you up again but my ſelf. As much as the life of the Son of GOD is more precious than the life of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; ſo much clearer is the proof which his death giveth us of the horror of ſin, than that which we might take from the death of all that ever ſinned; though we ſhould we ſee them ſtricken down together, and puniſhed by the avenging ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of GOD. But if this great Saviour do make us ſo feelingly perceive the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridneſs of our miſery, his end is only to make us the more ardently deſire and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the remedy, which he offereth us, fully prepared from that ſame Croſs to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50919:90"/>which he He was faſtned for us. I grant that the forbearance, and kindneſs of GOD, in his conduct of men, though ſinful, might give them ſome ſparkle of hope; and his promiſes under the old Covenant had highly confirm'd it betimes. But the Sword of his Juſtice dreadfully flaming in the hand of the Law, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed them not a little, and it was very difficult for them to accord His inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble righteouſneſs, with the mercy that was neceſſary for them. JESUS CHRIST hath removed all theſe difficulties, and exhibiteth unto us, in his Croſs, the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all our doubts. Fear nothing, ſinner, I (ſaith he) have contented the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, and ſatisfied his Law. Boldly truſt his promiſes, and approach his Throne with full aſſurance. This blood, which hath opened to you the entrance thither, is not the blood of a beaſt, nor an earthly ranſome; it is the blood of GOD, a ranſome of infinite value, more than ſufficient to take away your ſins, how infinite ſoever the demerit of them be. But you will ſay, This is not yet enough for my conſolation. CHRIST, I confeſs, ſufficiently aſſureth me of the pardon of my ſins. What aſſurance doth he give me againſt ſo many enemies, the world, the evil Angels, fleſh and blood, in midſt of whom my way doth lye? But, Chriſtian, doth not the ſame Croſs, which hath merited your pardon, give you alſo clear and undoubted evidence of your ſafety, during the whole courſe of your life? For ſince you underſtand by it, that GOD hath delivered up his only Son to death for you, how can you fear, that he will with-hold any of the cares of his Providence from you? Yet this is not all. CHRIST JESUS, who ſheweth us theſe excellent and ſacred verities, in his death, as it were engraven in great Letters on his Croſs, holds up others before our eyes, of no leſs importance, in his Reſurrection. Believers, neither the pardon of your ſin, nor the aſſiſtance of GOD during your life, would be ſufficient for you; for as much as after all, death will ſwallow you up, as well as unbelievers. See then further in your JESUS, the truth that is neceſſary to compleat your conſolation. By committing his ſpirit, at the point of death, into the Father's hands, he teacheth you, that GOD will receive your ſoul when you depart out of the world: And by riſing again the third day after, he aſſureth you, that your bodies ſhall one day be rais'd out of the duſt: And aſcending into Heaven, he aſſureth you, that you ſhall be tranſported thither both ſoul and body, to live and reign there with him in eternal glory. As for the way, which you muſt take, to arrive at this high happineſs, his whole life, and his death, have clearly mark'd it out to you; and he ſtill ſhews it you from that lofty Throne whereon he is ſet. Tread in my ſteps (ſaith he) if you will be exalted to my glory. Follow the example of my innocence, and of my charity, if you deſire to have part in the Crown of my Kingdom. I have born injuries with calmneſs and patience; I have conſtantly obeyed my Father even unto my death on the Croſs, and you ſee the honour wherewith he hath crowned me: Imitate my obedience, and you ſhall receive my recompence.</p>
                     <p>This is the leſſon which the LORD JESUS giveth us; ſhewing us incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more clearly than either the frame or government of the World, or the <hi>Moſaical</hi> diſpenſation ever did, both the Juſtice of GOD, that we may dread him, and the Power and Wiſdom of God, that we may reverence him and his mercy, that we may love and ſerve him with all the ſtrength of our ſouls; ſerve him, I ſay, not with the ſacrifices of old <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> nor with the feeble and childiſh devotions of Superſtition; but with a pure and holy heart, with works worthy of him, with an ardent zeal, a ſincere charity, a conſtant integrity and honeſty, a profound patience and humility, an immovable hope and confidence: Theſe are the Verities which do conſtitute true Wiſdom; all of them, as you ſee, high and ſublime, but in like degree uſeful and ſalutife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Here is not queſtion of the nature of Elements, of Animals, of Plants, or of Meteors; nor of the motions of the Sun, or of the Moon, or of the other Planets; but of the Beeing, and the Counſels, and the Conduct of that Great and Moſt High God, who made and formed all thoſe things, and in compariſon of whom, Heaven and Earth are but a Mite of duſt. Queſtion is not of numbers and figures, which can neither diminiſh your mſeries, nor make your ſouls hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; but of your peace with GOD, of your conſolation in this life, and of your
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50919:91"/>glory and immortality in the next. It's this which JESUS CHRIST teacheth us, that Divine crucified Perſon, who dyed and roſe again for us. Its this he ſhews us, repreſented in high and ſplendid colours through all the pieces of his Myſtery. However Nature and the Law might diſcover the brims and firſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of this Celeſtial Wiſdom, it's he alone who hath exhibited to us the whole body, and ſhewed us the entire frame and ſtructure of it. Conclude we then, that it is verily in him that all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg are hidden, as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>
                     <p>Embrace we this Concluſion with firm belief; and upon it, bleſs we GOD, firſt, for that he hath vouchſafed to give his CHRIST unto Mankind; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, for that he hath communicated him unto us, mercifully preſenting him to us both in his Word and in his Sacraments. Next, pray him to open our eyes more and more, that we may diſcern theſe rich and precious treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg which he hath hid in him. Let not the vileneſs of his Croſs, nor the veil of his Infirmity, nor the ſimplicity of his Goſpel, and theſe Sacraments wherein he is offer'd to us, offend us. This very thing, if we conſider it as we ought, makes up one principal part of the wonder; and that we may rightly know and value this treaſure, let us cleanſe our minds from the clay and mire of the earth; let us purifie our underſtandings, and rid them of the ſentiments and opinions of the world, which being faſtned to its own dung, doth prize nothing but the luſter of its falſe honours, and the vanity of its periſhing riches, and the delight of its unſeemly pleaſures. Let us once ſet free our ſouls from theſe fordid and ſervile paſſions; and acknowledg, as is clear, and viſible, and juſtified by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it's an extream error and folly to ſeek one's happineſs in ſuch wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched things. Lift we up our eyes unto Wiſdom, and deſire the poſſeſſion, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſtudy of it. It is the jewel and ornament of our nature; its whole dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſtands in it. Without it, man is little or nothing different from beaſts, nay in ſome ſort in worſe caſe than they; as ſinking beneath himſelf, and falling into utmoſt miſery. But give we good heed, leſt we take a ſhadow for ſubſtance, and a phantaſm for true wiſdom. Be not deceived. This wiſdom is only in CHRIST JESUS; All that pretended wiſdom which hath the acclamations and applauſes of people whether in the Courts, or in the Schools of the world, is but masked folly, a diſguiſed extravagance, and a painted error, which paſſeth by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and neceſſary part, and amuſeth its ſelf about that which is of no profit, nor any way provides for its own welfare; which is the true end of wiſdom. Seek it therefore in JESUS CHRIST alone. It is in him that you ſhall find the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it. And as thoſe that have any treaſure are wont to viſit it often, and have their hearts always in the place where it is: ſo think you, night and day, upon this Divine Saviour, in whom are hid the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: Conſider him, pry into him, and diligently ſound him. He is an Abyſs of good things. Have your hand ever there, and draw thence by faith, ſtudy, and meditation, all that is neceſſary for you. Let your whole life be taken up in the continual handling of theſe Divine Jewels, in admiring the beauty, and uſing the brightneſs of them. Let it be all the paſſion of your ſouls, the matter of your joys, and the conſolation of your troubles. If you have not thoſe falſe good things which the world ſo much glorieth in, remember that you have the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Heaven, the portion of Angels, the wiſdom and knowledg of happineſs. Take heed that none bereave you of ſo rich a poſſeſſion. Shut your ear againſt the prattle and plauſible diſcourſings of Seducers. Conſerve this treaſure coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly againſt their attempts: nor be content to have it only; communicate it to your neighbours: lay forth the wonders of it before their eyes, adorning all the parts of your life with it. Let the innocency, and ſanctity, and ſweetneſs, and humility of the LORD JESUS ſhine out in it. Let theſe be your Pearls, and your Jewels, and your Ornaments before men, which may conſtrain them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that JESUS CHRIST dwells in the midſt of you, and to ſay, Of a truth this Nation is a wiſe and underſtanding people. Above all, inſtruct your Children in this knowledg. Leave them this wiſdom for an inheritance. Such a portion is enough to make them happy; whereas without this they cannot poſſibly be other
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50919:91"/>than fools and wretches, though you ſhould leave them all the wealth of the Eaſt and Weſt.</p>
                     <p>Finally, ſince the Apoſtle aſſureth us, that all the treaſures of wiſdom are in JESUS CHRIST, let us content our ſelves with him alone, and centemn the vanity of thoſe who under any pretence whatſoever, would make paſs for wiſdom doctrines that are forreign, and without the ſphere of CHRIST. Let us not ſo much as give them the hearing. It's warrant enough for us to reject them, that they make up no part of the treaſure of JESUS CHRIST. I ſtand not to enquire, whether they be true or falſe, helpful or hurtful. It ſufficeth me, that whatever they be otherways, they are not in CHRIST. Nothing is to be received in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but what comes out of this treaſury. GOD, who hath given it us in his abundant mercy, and who calleth us to partake alſo of it the LORD's day next, grant us to conſerve it pure and entire, to poſſeſs it with joy and reſpect in this world, and reap the full fruit of it in that which is to come. <hi>So be it.</hi>

                     <p>AS men do not naturally love and deſire, but things which have an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of good; ſo they believe none but thoſe that have a ſemblance of truth; and they lay down love of the one, and belief of the others, as ſoon as they certainly diſcover that the former are evil, and the latter untrue. Whence it comes, that being prepoſſeſſed, upon ſome general and confuſed knowledg, with conceit that the enjoyment or belief of a thing would be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and advantageous to them, they wiſh it prove good and true; evidently preſuppoſing, that otherwiſe their very nature could not permit them to love it, or believe it. This is to be ſeen in children themſelves, who are the ſincereſt and moſt natural map of the motions of our nature. For when their Nurſes tell them any thing, they ask if it be true; and if the tale pleaſe them, they are troubled when they perceive it is but a tale; and would have it true, that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. So deeply imprinted in the mind of all reaſonable Creatures is this ſacred and inviolable principle of their nature, that nothing is to be believed but what is true. This advantage which truth naturally hath over falſhood, doth enforce its very enemies to counterfeit its mark, and wear its livery, they being ſenſible that their errors and falſhoods can have no paſſage among men, except they go under the appearance of ſome truth. Even as Coiners, that they may put off their Copper and Lead, do give it the colour and reſemblance of Gold and Silver, and counterfeit the image and ſtamp of a lawful Prince; or as they that would travel through an enemy's Countrey, do privily accommodate themſelves with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's badges: ſo Seducers, well knowing that the underſtanding of man is the proper and lawful Kingdom of truth, where nothing paſſes but under the avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50919:92"/>and marks of the ſame, do fard and diſguiſe the fictions which they would put off, and give them, as finely as they can, the countenance and colour of truth, that by the means of this falſe reſemblance they may paſs currant among men, who would reject them immediately if they ſaw them in their own natural like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There hath ever been a great number of theſe cheats in the world; a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of perſons being every where found, who pricked forward by ambition, or ſome other particular intereſt, do ſtrive to bring their fancies and dreams into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. But as Chriſtian Religion compriſeth the beſt and moſt important Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in the world; ſo there never was any profeſſion that Error and Impoſture have more laboured to corrupt, both by decrying ſome of its true doctrines on one hand, and by intermingling of falſhoods on the other. And as all the artifice of ſuch unhappy wits tendeth only to confound truth, and lies; ſo ought we to employ the utmoſt of our induſtry, that we may effectually ſever them, and ſo diſcern them, as we never take the one for the other. This diſcerning, dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, is one of the moſt important duties of our life. It is loſs, I confeſs, to take Copper for Gold, and bad money for good; and it is moreover ignorance, ever ſhameful, ſometimes not a little hurtful, to receive an error for truth in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and in civil life. But yet the loſs and ſhame that accrues from all this kind of cheats, reacheth no further than the preſent time; whereas the conſequents of thoſe impoſtures which we ſuffer in Religion, do extend even to eternity. For this cauſe the holy Apoſtle often warneth the faithful,
<note place="margin">Rom. 16.17. 1 Theſ. 5.21. Eph. 4.14. Heb. 5.14.</note> to whom he writeth, to beware of them, and to try all things with a great deal of care, that they may not be inveigled by ſeducers, nor take up their traditions for truths; willing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſound and thorough Chriſtian, to have his ſenſes exerciſed and habituated to diſcern between good and evil. You may have obſerved in the Text we have read, that this is the happineſs which he wiſheth, and would procure to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> keeping them from being drawn in by the fair ſpeeches of thoſe ſeducers that courted them. He had afore repreſented to them at large the abundance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the benefits of their LORD and Saviour; and he proteſted again in the verſe immediately foregoing, as you heard, if you remember, in our laſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe upon this ſubject, that <hi>in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST are hid all the treaſures of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledg.</hi> Now he ſheweth them the deſign upon which he ſo inſtantly repeateth what he ſeemed to have ſufficiently treated of in the precedent Texts. <hi>Now this I ſay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that none may deceive you with words of perſwaſion.</hi> And to give evidence that he did not put himſelf to this trouble vainly, or raſhly, he adds in the following verſe the knowledg that he had of their eſtate, it being as really before his eyes as if he were upon the place. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though I am abſent in body, yet in ſpirit I am with you, rejoycing, and ſeeing your order, and the firmneſs of your faith which you have in CHRIST.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The cognizance he took of their preſent ſtate, though he was in body far diſtant from them.</p>
                     <p>We will conſider them both, if GOD permit, as briefly as we can, pointing at what we judg uſeful for your edification and conſolation, both in the one and the other.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe two points the Apoſtle expreſſeth in theſe words, <hi>But this I ſay, that none may deceive you by words of perſwaſion.</hi> Upon which words we ſhall have two things to examine; The danger the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were in; and, the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of that which the Apoſtle ſays, to preſerve them from incurring it. The danger was great, and the evil, which it threatned, grievous and mortal, even the being deceived and ſeduced by the perſwaſive words which falſe Teachers uſed in this wretched deſign. There never was any ſervants of CHRIST, but ſuch a tentation did beſet them; Satan no ſooner ſeeing the truth of the Goſpel any where appear, but he immediately raiſeth up Impoſtors to corrupt it, and turn away thoſe that embrace it, from the purity and ſimplicity thereof. But
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50919:92"/>eſpecially at the beginning of Chriſtianity, when it was firſt preached and ſounded by the holy Apoſtles, then there aroſe a multitude of ſeducers, who did their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to deprave and marr this divine ſeed of the ſalvation of men; and the Devil made like attempts in our Fathers days, when perceiving the Goſpel to be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he might preſently obſtruct this holy work, he ſpeedily brought into the field a world of ſpirits, ſome audacious and extravagant, others ſubtil and ſelfiſh, which endeavoured to ſcandalize, or to ſeduce the ſimple: thoſe, by the prodigies of their fond imaginations: theſe, by the plauſible appearances of their falſe accommodations. But they which troubled the Church in the Apoſtle's time, did addreſs themſelves, among others, to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> in particular, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears both by what he intimateth briefly here; and more clearly yet, by what he addeth in the ſeries of this Chapter. He doth not name them; but his ſaying, <hi>that none deceive you,</hi> is a ſufficient evidence that there were ſome craſtsmen of this quality about them, who took pains to enſnare them. It is therefore th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> ſame he aimeth at, and againſt the force of their ſeducements doth he arm the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> He ſheweth here both the end to which they tended, (even the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the faithful) and the means they uſed about it, (namely, words of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion). The term he pitcheth upon to expreſs the firſt of theſe, doth not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſimply to deceive, but to deceive by falſe and captious ratiocination. For theſe bad men knowing well that the ſpirits of men are not brought to embrace nor avoid any thing, without ſome reaſon; it being the natural order and diſpoſition of all our actions and motions, that the underſtanding do ſtill precede the will; they begin the effecting of our ruin there; and, to entangle our minds in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, they propoſe us reaſons, falſe indeed, but appearing otherwiſe; ſuch as have the colour and countenance, but not the eſſential form and ſubſtance of a good and ſolid diſcourſe. This the word <hi>(Paralogiſm)</hi> here uſed by the Apoſtle, doth properly ſignifie. It's a ſophiſm, a falſe and ſpurious arguing, which by its vain appearance and fallacious blaze, leadeth men into error; as thoſe fatuous fires, which riſing ſometimes in the dark of night, do trail thoſe that follow them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to precipices. Satan the Father of all Sophiſters, took this courſe firſt; having miſerably ſeduced our firſt Parents by the illuſion of a falſe diſcourſe, the vanity whereof experience clearly demonſtrated: for that he might corrupt their will, he attaqued their underſtandings in the firſt place; and beguiled them, that he might deſtroy them; perſwading, that the forbidden fruit would make them like GOD. Thoſe whom he hath ſet on work ſince that time, have all followed this method, there having never riſen Heretick, either under the Old or the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, but hath painted over his impoſtures with ſome deceivable reaſons. Only this difference may be obſerv'd among ſuch men, that ſome do the thing malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and againſt their own conſcience; others, through ignorance. The former ſort are true children of the Devil, and the moſt execrable of all men, as combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that truth which they are conſcious of; and defending error by reaſons, whoſe vanity they well underſtand; neverthelſs they forbear not to labour in this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py deſing, either for the acquiring of glory to themſelves, or for creating trouble to Teachers of truth, whom they have conceiv'd an hatred of. Thoſe of the other ſort who do it through ignorance, have leſs guilt and wickedneſs, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, but are no leſs dangerous. For believing in good earneſt the errors which they do advance, they ſtrive to perſwade others to them with ſo much the more paſſion and fervency, as imagining that they ſerve them, when they indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; and that they edifie, when in truth they ruin them.
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.2.</note> Such were thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> beareth witneſs, that <hi>they had a zeal of God, but without knowledg.</hi> They believ'd themſelves the error which they recommended; and were in thoſe ſnares, wherewith they ſought to entangle others. And in this rank we muſt place the moſt of thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, who take ſo much pains to draw us into their miſtakes; not only thoſe of the people, but alſo many of their Monks, and of their Doctors, who labour to deceive others, becauſe they have been themſelves deceiv'd; having run into that erroneous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion into which they would induce us; and confirmed themſelves from time to time in it by thoſe ſophiſms and falſe reaſonings which they offer us, and which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50919:93"/>they have either learnt of their inſtructors, or invented of themſelves. We muſt equally take heed of both theſe ſorts of workers. For how different ſoever the motive of their acting be, the effect of it is ever the ſame, even ſeduction and perdition. And as poyſon forbears not to kill the man that takes it, though it have been ignorantly given him by a perſon that know it not to be poyſon, who perchance took of it himſelf, thinking it a remedy; ſo error, from whatever hand it come, hath ſtill a bad effect; and the opinion they have of it, who preſent it to us, doth not change the venom of it, nor impede its corrupting of our ſouls, and extinguiſhing Divine life in us, if we do receive it.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle in this place pointeth out the means alſo, which falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers uſe for the ſetting up of their errors. That none (ſaith he) may deceive you, by words of perſwaſions. Theſe he calls elſewhere in the ſame caſe ſweet and flattering words,
<note place="margin">Rom. 16.18.</note> ſaying in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that Schiſmaticks and ſuch as make diviſions contrary to the doctrine we have learned, do ſeduce the hearts of the ſimple by ſweet and flattering words.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> And this he nameth again elſewhere, the enticing words of man's wiſdom. Under theſe terms he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth all the advantages, and attractives of diſcourſe; all that it hath in it, which is apt to touch and win hearts; as either probable reaſons, wherewith it is furniſht, or beauty of terms and expreſſions, or artificial diſpoſition, and graceful pronunciation. There is none but knows how potent theſe charms of eloquence are. They ſometimes dazzel the beſt eyes, and do deceive the firmeſt minds. It's a kind of Magick and Enchantment which makes things appear quite otherwiſe than they are, and gives them colours and qualities that are not their own; which maketh Honey paſs for Wormwood, and Wormwood for Honey; black for white, and white for black.

'Tis by its ſleights that truth, how invincible ſoever it be, hath ſometimes ſeemed to be vanquiſhed. 'Tis to its dexterity and its ſtratagems that error and falſhood do we the greateſt part of their lying-triumphs. For feeling themſelves in reality weak, they have recourſe ordinarily to this kind of Sorcery; that they may carry by its illuſions what they could never win by true and legitimate ſtrength. 'Tis it that maintaineth Sophiſters, and Wranglers, and Mountebanks, and Seducers. With the ſophiſtry and prattle which it lendeth them, they have the hardineſs to ſhew themſelves, and to oppoſe the cleareſt truths, and recommend the groſſeſt errors. But among all the buſie people that uſe it, there are none that employ it more perniciouſly, than Hereticks and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of Religion. This falſe Rhetorick is the principal inſtrument they ſeduce withall. Accordingly it is evident, that they have always taken it up, and ſcarce ever attempted upon Truth, but with this ſort of weapons. And it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that they help themſelves by them with wonderful dexterity. Never was cauſe, in matter of Religion, more ſordid, or ſhameful, or ſeeble, than that of the Pagans; yet they that pleaded it againſt the ancient Chriſtians, knew ſo well how to fard it with the colours of their falſe reaſons, and the gloſs of their brave words, that they made it paſs for plauſible among the multitude, and rendered Chriſtianity ridiculous to them, how holy and lightſome ſoever its truth was. Thoſe Hereticks which aroſe from among Chriſtians, had no leſs ability and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialneſs to recommend their impoſtures, borrowing for this purpoſe, from the Philoſophers and Orators of the world, the ſubtilties of their Logick, and all the colours of their Rhetorick. There are ſtill left us ſome pieces of the one and the other, in the Books of Antiquity; as the Diſcourſes of one <hi>Celſus</hi> in <hi>Origen;</hi> of one <hi>Caecilius</hi> in <hi>Minutius;</hi> of <hi>Porphyrius</hi> and <hi>Symmachus,</hi> for Paganiſm; divers wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> for <hi>Montaniſm;</hi> of <hi>Fanſtus,</hi> for the <hi>Manichees;</hi> and of <hi>Julian,</hi> for the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> in S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> It's wonderful with what dexterity and with what grace and eloquence they do manage ſuch bad and infamous ſubjects; nor can I read them, without lamenting the unhappineſs of ſo many excellent and highly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approvable things, to be miſerably profaned in the ſervice of error; as one cannot

And I note it expreſly to you, my Brethren, that you may not think it ſtrange if thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day do ſpeciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a very bad Cauſe; nor be much moved at the oſtentation they make of it, who are not aſhamed to boaſt of the eloquence and ſubtilty of their Teachers, as if this were one of the marks of truth. I freely conſent to the praiſes they give them, and do acknowledg, that words of perſwaſion (as the Apoſtle here calls them) do abound on their ſide: but I dare affirm notwithſtanding, and am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that every intelligent and unpaſſionate perſon will accord with me herein, That, how ſubtil and eloquent ſoever their Maſters be, and how much pains ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have taken for the better plaſtring over, and colouring, and burniſhing of their Doctrine, in concluſion their works are not more neat, nor more polite, nor more ſpecious and fair-ſeeming, than the works of thoſe Pagans and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks whom I but now named; yea, to ſpeak without paſſion, I believe they are far inferior to them. Let them forbear therefore to urge unto us for a mark of truth, an advantage which is common to them with Pagans and Hereticks; an advantage which the moſt infamous Cauſes do employ, which the worſt do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſeek after more earneſtly than the beſt; ſo much more cunning being uſed in their defence, by how much leſs ſtrength they have in themſelves. Not that I would decry eloquence and acuteneſs, or render them ſuſpect with you, as if they never were in other ſervice than of error; I willingly acknowledg, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent graces of GOD, and that he gives them to men properly for the defence of Truth, and ſure they have not always had the hard hap to contend for Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. They have often done good ſervice to the Goſpel, and employed their might for its glory, both heretofore againſt the Pagans and the old Hereticks; and in our times againſt thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by the writings both of the Fathers, and of our own Doctors; a good number of them being found, who even in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect come no whit behind their adverſaries; beſides their having the principal advantage, that is, the truth on their ſide. This <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who here condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth words of perſwaſion when they recommend error, doth not reject them when they are labouring for truth. And though he was not much verſed in the art of prophane eloquence; whence it comes, that he ſaith of himſelf, that for ſpeech he was as one of the Vulgar; yet his diſcourſes want no ſtrength nor grace; that rich heavenly knowledg which abounded in his heart, giving its tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to the words of his mouth; and that great perſonage indeed felt how it was, who hearing him ſpeak, was preſs'd with the force of his diſcourſe, and ſaid aloud, <hi>Thou almoſt perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian.</hi> All my aim is,
<note place="margin">Acts 26.28.</note> that ſince error of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes abuſeth eloquence and acuteneſs, againſt the truth, as evil men do other gifts of God to evil ends; we ſhould not judg of the main of any cauſe by this advantage, nor haſtily embrace that party that defends it ſelf with the beſt and moſt perſwafive words, nor reject that which hath leaſt of theſe ornaments in view. As Innocence is not always the beſt clothed, ſo Truth frequently is not the moſt decked. And though of it ſelf it be always more probable, more likely, and more eaſily maintainable than falſhood,

Take we heed then of their ſurpriſing us, and ſo well fortifie our minds againſt their illuſions, that they may never make us reject the truth, how foul and ugly ſoever they paint it out; nor receive a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, how ſpecious and plauſible ſoever they do render it. Remember, that that <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Mother of Error, who is pourtrayed before us in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 17.4.</note> doth preſent its abominations unto men in a golden Cup; that is, ſhe gives her poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a pleaſing Veſſel, and ſhuts up and hides the horridneſs of her impoſtures under very fair and ſpecious words; it's this that thoſe ſeducers yerwhile did, who ſollicited the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> their errors were attended with perſwaſive words for the beguiling of them. This is the danger from which S. <hi>Paul</hi> would here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them.</p>

                     <p>Let us now conſider the means he puts into their hands for their ſafe guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves from it. <hi>This I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that no one may deceive you with enticing words.</hi> Since he thus ſpeaks, it's evident, that what he ſaith is able, if we improve it as we ought, to keep us from falling into the miſleadings of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, and to fruſtrate all the charms of its good and perſwaſive words. What then is it that he ſaith? and what at laſt is that ſo holy and ſo efficacious a ſpeech, which can diſſipate the illuſions and enchantments of error? Dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you heard it in the expoſition of the precedent Text, where this holy man told us, that <hi>all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg are hid in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> It's that he underſtandeth here. This is that Celeſtial Oracle to which he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes this great vertue. This is the remedy which he giveth us againſt all the poyſons, and all the charms of ſeduction. None of the weapons or of the wiles of error can bear up before this ſacred word. It alone is ſufficient, if we uſe it as we ought, to confound and annihilate all the pretended wonders of the eloquence and ſubtilty of falſe Teachers, as heretofore the Rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſwallowed up all the Rods of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magicians. For whoſoever ſhall hold faſt this principle in his heart, that all true wiſdom and knowledg is in JESUS CHRIST, he will receive nothing out of CHRIST. Being content with this treaſure, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all other things, how ſpecious and plauſible ſoever they may be. Seduction will do well to diſplay its arts, and to gild and paint over its inventions with the fair colours either of ratiocination, or of eloquence. It will get no ground upon ſuch a one, ſince after all, the thing it doth ſo carefully poliſh, is not in JESUS CHRIST, out of whom he will know nothing. He will not ſo much as hear the babling of error, ſo far will he be from being affected with it. He will ſhut his car againſt its fine words; ſo far is he from being ſeduced by them. Or if he pleaſe to caſt his eye upon the works of its ſubtilty and its eloquence, he will look upon them as Spiders webs, or as jugling, and Gipſies feats, which amuſe us, and beguile our ſenſes, but make no impreſſion on our hearts. We well know they do deceive us, though we cannot tell how. So the faithful man will hold that for a deceit, and an illuſion, that leads him out of JESUS CHRIST, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways he do not ſee wherein the ſophiſm of the error doth conſiſt, nor is able clearly to unty the knots thereof. This, dear Brethren, is the ſure and infallible means to exclude, and to expel all error from among us. Seducement winneth nothing, but upon thoſe that betray this gate, and yeild it, that there may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be of good and ſaving importance out of JESUS CHRIST, and his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. When once it hath this ground given, it never wanteth paint and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to colour its deluſions, and render even thoſe plauſible and likely, which are otherways groſſeſt and moſt extravagant. Thus thoſe Traditions and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which have ſtill the vogue among our Adverſaries, were by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle obtruded upon Chriſtians. The invocation of Angels, and of Saints depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Sacrifice of the Altar, and the veneration of Reliques and of Images; the viſible Head, and the Hierarchy, and the infallibility of the Church; Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, and the merit of works; Prayers and Services in a language not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; the adoration of the Hoſt; Communion in one kind only; Purgatory, Suffrages for the dead, and many other ſuch like things. A thouſand, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand colours are found to paint them out, and recommend either the belief or the practiſe of them to poor people. There are huge Books made about them, full of wit and eloquence, that drive the matter ſo far, as to make theſe things paſs for the principal and moſt uſeful part of Chriſtian devotion. But this ſhort Saying of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s is enough to ruin all their labours, and to ſecure us from all their ſnares; <hi>In JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</hi> It ſufficeth me to have Him, ſince having Him, I have all appertaineth to true wiſdom. How well diſputed, and how eloquently ſoever pleaded all your traditions be, I am not concerned in them, ſeeing I have the treaſure of all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in CHRIST JESUS. And it is not here alone that the Apoſtle giveth us this leſſon for the freeing our ſelves from the intanglements and ſnares of error: Elſewhere inſtructing the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and exhorting them that they would not be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50919:94"/>carried to and fro with divers and ſtrange doctrines; he lays before them, at the entrance, this divine principle, <hi>That JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST is the ſame, both yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it's now time to come to the ſecond part of our Text, in which the Apoſtle declares to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> the cognizance he took of the ſtate of their Church. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though I be abſent in body, yet in ſpirit I am with you, rejoycing and ſeeing your order, and the firmneſs of your faith which you have in CHRIST.</hi> This is the reaſon why he advertiſeth them to take heed of the wiles of ſeducers, and why he ſo carefully puts into their hands the means to preſerve themſelves. For ſome might have thought it ſtrange, that being ſo far from them, and in all likelihood ignorant of the ſtate wherein they were, he ſhould yet give them ſuch an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement. He preventeth this ſurmiſe, and anſwers, that though at <hi>Rome</hi> he were, nevertheleſs he minded what was a doing at <hi>Coloſs;</hi> the affection which he bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> them, obliging him to intereſs himſelf in all their concernments. Wonder not (ſaith he) that I beſpeak you in this manner, and ſend you, from ſo far off, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives againſt ſeduction: For though ſo many Seas and Hills do ſever my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from you, yet my ſpirit is with you, taking part in all that doth betide you, rejoycing in the proſperous eſtate of your piety; but likewiſe fearing the attempts of thoſe enemies which I ſee round about you ready to ſow the tares of Schiſm and Error, upon any the leaſt overture they find for it. Some referr his ſaying, <hi>that he wasi n ſpirit with the Coloſſians,</hi> to an extraordinary and miraculous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, who repleniſhing his ſoul with light, made him thereby ſee things that paſſed at the greateſt diſtance, as clearly as if he had been preſent; after the ſame manner that GOD had afore-time ſhewed <hi>Eliſha</hi> what his ſervant <hi>Gehazi</hi> did with <hi>Naaman;</hi> a paſſage, which accordingly the Prophet expreſſeth almoſt in the ſame manner.
<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.26.</note> 
                        <hi>Went not my heart with thee</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Gehazi</hi>) <hi>when the man turned again from his Chariot to meet thee?</hi> I confeſs ſurely, that GOD could eaſily have made known to <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Priſons of <hi>Nero,</hi> where he was, all that paſs'd in the Church of <hi>Coloſs,</hi> with as much, yea more clearneſs, than if he had been preſent there; and have revealed alſo to him the whole ſtate of other Churches further diſtant from <hi>Italy;</hi> as he made <hi>Ezekiel</hi> while living in captivity at <hi>Babylon,</hi> to ſee the moſt ſecret actions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the City, and the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But becauſe it is dangerous to argue from what GOD can do, to what he doth; and under colour of ſome ſleight probabilities, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon things which his word doth not at all affirm: Moreover, ſince we muſt not multiply Miracles without neceſſity; I account it beſt and ſafeſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having receourſe to this extraordinary kind of preſence, to interpret theſe words of the Apoſtle ſimply, as others do, of a preſence in reſpect of care and affection. For nothing is more common in all Languages, than to ſay, that our mind is in ſuch places, and with ſuch perſons, as we think upon, and have affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to. Whence comes the vulgar ſaying, that the ſoul is where it loves, becauſe there it ordinarily keeps its deſires, its love, and its cogitations. And it is thus alſo that we muſt take what the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> that <hi>though abſent in body, he was preſent with them in ſpirit;</hi> He means ſimply, that his bonds did not detain his ſpirit, or ſhut it up in the Priſons of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor hinder him from mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them every hour, and having his affections and thoughts continually among them; figuring to himſelf the eſtate which they were in, in as lively a manner as if he had had them before his bodily eyes; and drawing from this lively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception the ſame movings of joy, contentment, and fear, as the ſight of them would have wrought within him. So as there need be no wonder, if having them ſo deeply engraven on his heart, and ſtill preſent to the eyes of his mind, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pained for them, and at ſuch diſtance preſcribe them neceſſary precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and preſervatives againſt the pleaſant, but pernicious poyſons of error. And obſerve, I beſeech you, this holy man's prudent and apt procedure. For, to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that care which he took of them, he doth not urge the danger they were in, their weakneſs, or the bad inclinations which ſome of them had: This diſcourſe would have been offenſive, as ſhewing a diſtruſt of their piety; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he here tells them of the proſperity of their ſpiritual eſtate, the beauty of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50919:95"/>their order, and the conſtancy of their faith. <hi>Rejoycing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſeeing your order, and the firmneſs of your faith.</hi> Do not imagine (ſaith he) that I have an ill opinion of your piety, becauſe I do ſo earneſtly adviſe you to ſtand faſt: I am very well ſatisfied concerning it; and do find you in ſo good a poſture, that I have much conſolation at it; this matter being ſo pleaſing to me, that it fills my heart with joy, notwithſtanding the ſad eſtate that I am in. But from the ſame root, whence ſprings my joy, my ardent deſire to ſee you go on from good to better, doth alſo ariſe; and with it the ſollicitude and care I take to exhort it; becauſe it would be an extream regret and diſpleaſure, to ſee Error waſte or wound ſo fair and flouriſhing a Church, ever ſo little. See how by praiſing them he doth oblige them to regard his advertiſements; and by the very conſideration of their having ſo well begun, doth more and more engage them to holy perſevering to the end. Thus he alſo treated the <hi>Philippians, My beloved brethren</hi> (ſaid he to them) <hi>and much deſired,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 4.1.</note> 
                        <hi>my joy, and my crown; ſo ſtand faſt in the LORD, my dearly beloved.</hi> You perceive of your ſelves, without my indication, that when he ſays, <hi>rejoycing and ſeeing your order;</hi> the meaning is, rejoycing to ſee, or for that I ſee your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For in Scripture-language, and even in our vulgar ſpeech, the particle <hi>[and]</hi> is often uſed in this ſenſe, and ſignifies, <hi>becauſe that,</hi> or, <hi>foraſmuch as.</hi> He praiſeth and extolleth two things in theſe faithful perſons, wherein the happineſs and the perfection of a Church doth conſiſt; to wit, Order, and a firm and conſtant Faith. By the order of theſe <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> he meaneth the good diſpoſition of all the parts of their Church, the vigilancy of the Paſtors, the ſubmiſſion and obedience of the Flock, their joint-regard of Diſcipline; each keeping themſelves within the bounds of their vocation, and both together living in concord and good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, honeſtly, and without ſcandal. For, that order comprehendeth alſo puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſanctity of behaviour, the Apoſtle evidently ſheweth in another place; where,
<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.6.</note> to ſignifie thoſe that lead a ſcandalous life, he ſaith, that they <hi>walk diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly.</hi> He praiſeth alſo the firmneſs of their faith in JESUS CHRIST; ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, both that full perſwaſion they had of the truth and divinity of his Goſpel, and their conſtancy to hold it faſt, notwithſtanding the aſſaults and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Enemy. It's this Faith, dear Brethren, and this Order of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians,</hi> that was the matter of the Apoſtle's joy, and the occaſion both of the deſire he had to ſee them perſevere ſtill in ſo good a courſe, and of the advice he gave them, not to ſuffer themſelves to be beguiled by the perſwaſive words of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers; as likewiſe, of the adding that preſervative, of meditating inceſſantly upon the treaſures of wiſdom, which are in JESUS, for the ſaving themſelves from this mortal danger.</p>
                     <p>It's now our concernment to make a good improvement of ſo excellent a leſſon. We are as much environ'd, or more than the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> ſometimes were, with people that endeavour to deceive us with words of perſwaſion, that daily make all kind of attempts upon our faith, and do not forget the ſophiſms of ſubtilty, or the charms of eloquence, preſenting error to us farded with divers ſpecious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. For the ſecuring of our minds from their illuſions, let us tell them, as the Apoſtle teacheth us, That all the Treaſures of wiſdom are hid in that JESUS CHRIST whom we have embraced; that He ſufficeth to make us wiſe to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that we need to know none but Him to obtain happineſs. If with fair and artificial words they repreſent to us the neceſſity of an expiatory Sacrifice, for the recommending that of their own Altars; or the utility of Satisfactions, to make us receive theirs; or the horror of fin, which hath no entrance into the Kingdom of GOD, to perſwade us upon their Purgatory; or the need we have of an Interceſſor, to oblige us to have recourſe to the mediation of Angels, and of departed Saints; or of an Head, to ſet up their Pope: Let us anſwer them, That we have all this moſt fully in JESUS CHRIST; that His Croſs is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; His Sufferings our Satisfactions; His Blood our Purgation. That while we poſſeſs Him, we ſhall need neither an Interceſſor to open the Throne of the Grace of GOD to us, and render both our perſons and our prayers acceptable to Him; nor an Head to govern and conſerve us. Let us account all that would turn us aſide from Him, or place any part of its Treaſure elſewhere than in Him,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50919:95"/>to be a ſeduction and an illuſion. And, as good Phyſicians do not only preſerve from poyſons, but alſo draw profit from them, by making them Remedies; ſo let us not content our ſelves to keep the venom of Seducements from hurting us; let us manage them in ſuch ſort, as that they may ſerve us. Let the arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they have for Error, enflame our zeal for the Truth: Let their pains-taking and induſtry, ſharpen our diligence and care. Let us employ that acuteneſs and eloquence, to the defence of the Goſpel, which they prophane in the ſervice of an Impoſture. Let us have no leſs affection for the Cauſe of GOD, than they have for the matters of fleſh and blood. And inſtead of the extravagancy of ſome who love ignorance and rudeneſs, becauſe Error doth abuſe Knowledg and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; let us on the contrary, thence take occaſion to labour in adorning and embelliſhing of Truth, that even in this reſpect Falſhood may have no advantage above it. But if the examples of enemies ſhould be of uſe to us, much more ought the examples of Brethren be ſo, which wholly and ſolely tend to our edification. Let us make our profit of that of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> whoſe faith and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtle praiſeth, that we might imitate it. Let us put our Church into ſuch an eſtate, as may give joy to the LORD, to His Angels, and to His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. I may not deny, but that your ſaith and order may be, in ſome degree, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without flattery, ſince by the Grace of CHRIST, my Brethren, you perſevere in His fear, and aſſiduouſly rank your ſelves under His Enſigns, no tentation having been able hitherto to make you deſert theſe holy Aſſemblies. But you are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that together with this well-doing, there are many miſcarriages among us; that there paſs divers things in our Congregations ſmally comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the dignity of the Houſe of GOD; and that the hardneſs of ſome doth ſtiffen it ſelf againſt Diſcipline, the only Bond of Order; and if our Faith be conſtant againſt Error, it is too too yeilding unto Vice. Dear Brethren, I had rather leave the examination of it to your own Conſciences, than here publiſh our ſin and ſhame, and will content my ſelf with telling you,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10.</note> that the Apoſtle baniſheth out of Heaven the vicious, as well as the idolatrous. GOD, who hath granted us to perſevere in the profeſſion of His Truth, be pleaſed powerfully to amend, by the virtue of His Goſpel, the defects which His gentleneſs hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to born with, in us; and ſanctifie us ſo efficaciouſly, that after we have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Him on Earth by the good order of our converſation, and the fruirs of a firm and unmoved Faith, we may one day receive, in the Heavens, from His merciful hand, the Reward and Crown of bliſsful immortality, in His Son JESUS CHRIST, who in the Unity of the Father, and of the Holy Ghoſt, liveth and reigneth the only GOD, bleſſed for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Our ſoul</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>is dried up, there's nothing here; our eyes ſee nought but Manna.</hi> Dear Brethren, this Hiſtory is a fit emblem of what hath betided men in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to JESUS CHRIST and His Goſpel; the true Bread of Heaven ſent down from GOD into the Wilderneſs of this World, for the eternal nutriment of Mankind; of which that ancient Manna, as you know, was the figure, according to what Himſelf teacheth us in the ſixth of S. <hi>John.</hi> For our nature is no leſs delicate, nor hath an appetite leſs extravagant in reſpect of the Doctrines that are neceſſary to ſeed our Souls, than it hath in reſpect of the Meat that is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the refection of our Bodies. The truth of the LORD JESUS is embraced at the firſt with hungring, and heat, every one admiring the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this heavenly food, which wholly exceedeth the productions of the earth. But becauſe, though it be throughout holy, and ſalutiferous, yet it is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and uniform; the vanity of man in deſiring change and variety, makes him diſguſt it immediately, and betake himſelf to ſeek out novelties for the ſeaſoning and rendring of it more grateful. The Apoſtles had ſcarce ſown this ſacred do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the Church, as in the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but evil workers preſently roſe up, who to remedy men's diſdain, and accommodate this Celeſtial verity to their palate, would needs add to it divers inventions and novelties of their own forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> foretold, that more ſuch would ariſe, as bad or worſe than the firſt.

                        <hi>Having</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>itching ears, they ſhall aſſemble to themſelves Teachers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own deſires, and ſhall turn away their ears from the truth, and turn unto fables.</hi> O prophecy too true! How punctually haſt thou been fulfilled! This fooliſh itch of the ear hath cauſed a thouſand and a thouſand fantaſies and novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be by little and little entertained among Chriſtians, which have ſo born down, and as it were overwhelm'd the Goſpel, that it is hardly to be diſcerned any longer; as you may ſee in the Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is but an heap of Traditions, Errors, and Superſtitions, partly copied out from <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and ſome
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50919:96"/>from Paganiſm it ſelf, partly iſſuing from the private ſpeculations of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons. In our Fathers days, the Goſpel having been brought out of the dark caverns of ignorance, into the light of men, it was receiv'd in like manner with ardor and admiration. But that diſguſting of the beſt and moſt wholeſom things, which is fatal to us, overtook it quickly, and did ſtir up, as alſo it full doth, divers ſpirits, who for remedy, do ſtrive to ſophiſticate this pure Doctrine, and dreſs up its ſimplicity with their own inventions, to make it pleaſe the world, To cure us of this faſtidiouſneſs, the Apoſtle at this time addreſſeth to us the exhortation you have heard; the ſame which he ſometime made to the <hi>Coleſſians</hi> for the ſame end; forbidding them novelties and ſtrange doctrines, and enjoining them to ſtand faſt in JESUS CHRIST, who had been preached to them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out admitting or deſiring any thing beyond His Goſpel. Therefore (ſaith he) <hi>as you have received the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, ſo walk in Him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe words, for the giving you a full and entire expoſition of them, we have two things to conſider;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle's enjoining the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to keep and faſten to the LORD JESUS; this is the ſenſe and intention of the firſt verſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The manner how he would have them faſten to the LORD; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the confirmation and abounding of their faith in his Goſpel with thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Theſe two particulars we purpoſe to treat of in this Exerciſe, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of CHRIST, for your edification and conſolation.</p>
                     <p>And for the firſt; You may remember, that in the precedent Text the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle praiſed the faithful people of <hi>Coloſs,</hi> and rejoyced at the good order he ſaw in their Church, and at the firmneſs of their faith in JESUS CHRIST. But becauſe it is not ſufficient to begin well, except we do continue; in as much as ſalvation is promiſed only to thoſe that ſhall perſevere unto the end; with good reaſon, and very pertinently, doth he now add, to the praiſe he gave them, an exhortation to continue, and to abide firm in that good and happy ſtate wherein they were; and this ſo much the rather, for that there were about them certain buſie and unquiet ſpirits, who with their inventions and ſubtilties endeavoured to vitiate the ſincerity of their belief, as you have already heard, and ſhall again more particularly hear in the ſequel of this Chapter. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he to them) <hi>as you have received the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, ſo walk in Him.</hi> JESUS CHRIST is the Subject, in which he would have them to abide. For <hi>He is the way, the truth, and the life;</hi> neither is there ſalvation in any other. But becauſe theſe falſe Teachers, for the better putting off their vain traditions, were wont to colour them with our Saviour's Name; knowing well, that every faithful perſon would ſoon hiſs at them, if they ſpake openly of our quitting JESUS CHRIST, or our diſtancing our ſelves from him. The Apoſtle anticipates this danger, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſhews the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> how he intends they ſhould abide firm in JESUS CHRIST, ſaying, <hi>As you have received the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, ſo walk in Him.</hi> And to this alſo, that which he adds in the following Verſe, hath relation; <hi>As you you have been taught.</hi> By this he clearly ſignifies, that the doctrine which had been delivered them, either by himſelf, (if it be true that he preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to them, and founded their Church, as ſome think) or by <hi>Epaphras,</hi> as moſt are of opinion. He ſignifies, I ſay, that this Doctrine which had been preached to them, and believed by them, was ſo holy, and divine, and ſufficient to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was their duty conſtantly to adhere thereto, and to admit nothing beyond what they had heard, under any pretext whatſoever. <hi>Here is the way,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 30.21.</note> 
                        <hi>walk in it, whether ye turn to the right hand, or to the left,</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſometime ſaid: But by theſe words, the Apoſtle not only marketh out to them, and ſtateth that Doctrine which they ought to hold; he obligeth them alſo thereto, by their own intereſt: For ſince they had receiv'd it, they could not again part from it, without condemning themſelves either of imprudence, or of levity. For he that quits the Faith he once embraced, doth thereby evidently ſhew, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, in having ſometime taken a falſe or imperfect Doctrine for good; or levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in quitting and altering now, a Doctrine good &amp; ſufficient when he received it.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50919:97"/>If your belief be good, why do you change it? If it be otherwiſe, why did you entertain it? It follows of neceſſity, either that there was error and precipitation in the one, or that there is weakneſs and ſickleneſs in the other. So you ſee, that the intereſt of their own reputation did oblige theſe Chriſtians to that conſtancy which the Apoſtle enjoins them. Beſides, though it be an hainous ſin, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the LORD JESUS when He preſents Himſelf to us by His Goſpel; yet it is much more enormous to caſt Him out after reception given Him: as it is by far a greater outrage, to thruſt forth a man from your Houſe when you have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him, than to have ſhut your doors againſt him at the firſt. The one is a ſimple offence; the other is an affront. In like manner, it is a much more inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious treatment to deſert CHRIST JESUS after having follow'd him, than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have given ear to, or follow'd him at all. And obſerve here, I pray, the efficacy of ſound doctrine; it is ſuch, as that in receiving it, we receive JESUS CHRIST himſelf. For, this Higheſt LORD comes in to all ſuch as embrace his Goſpel. And we may apply to this purpoſe what he ſaid to his Apoſtles on a like occaſion; <hi>Whoſo receiveth</hi> them, <hi>receiveth</hi> him; whoſo gives credit to their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, ſhall have their Maſter to be with him: He ſhall entertain not Men or Angels, but the King of Men and Angels, the Eternal Son of God, the Prince of Life, and Father of Eternity. He that receives the Doctrine of an <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or a <hi>Plato,</hi> or of a Father, or a Pope; and in ſhort, of any man whatever, doth not thereupon receive the Author of the Doctrine himſelf; becauſe no man hath either the power or the means to communicate himſelf to thoſe that credit his inſtructions. But JESUS CHRIST, being GOD bleſſed for ever, of a Nature, a Wiſdom, and a Power infinite, he accompanieth his own Goſpel, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates himſelf to thoſe that receive it; he dwelleth in their hearts by faith; he there ſheds abroad the light and influence of his Spirit; he bringeth thither with him Peace, and Life, and Joy.</p>
                     <p>Now to cloſe up this part, Take heed you do not ſtretch S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his intention; as if his meaning were, that generally every one ſhould hold to that which he hath been taught, and never part with what he hath once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, whatever the things be which he hath believ'd, and whoever the perſons were that delivered them. GOD forbid that an imagination ſo ſottiſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, and ſo very far from the Apoſtle's mind, ſhould ever enter into your heart. By this account, thoſe that have been in an error, ſhould do well not to come out of it; and it ſhould not be lawful for ſuch as have taken poiſon inſtead of a remedy, to caſt it away. Neither ſhould point of honour and generoſity be urged in this caſe; perſeverance in an error, once known, is not conſtancy, but obſtinateneſs. It's a part of true generoſity to confeſs one's fault, and forſake it; and it is clearly a ſeebleneſs of ſpirit not to let go what is falſe, or naught, upon the pretence that you had the ill hap to cloſe ſometime with it. I confeſs it had been better to have rejected it at firſt; but ſetling in it after conviction, is a doubling of your fault and infelicity. And as for Honour, it's a pitiful extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy to place it in things contrary to duty and vertue. If Error be honourable, I ſhall yeeld, that he that confirms himſelf in it, is a man of Honour. But ſince quite contrary, all confeſs, as is moſt evidently true, that Error is a ſhameful thing, and blame-worthy; who ſees not, but that true Honour obligeth us to quit it, and not ſtiffen our ſelves in it? and that, pretending of Honour for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in error, or in vice, is to go about (as the Goſpel ſays) <hi>to gather figs from a thorn,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 6.44.</note> 
                        <hi>and grapes from a thiſtle?</hi> It is as if a man would attempt to white himſelf with Ink, and cleanſe himſelf with Mud. In a word, it is a ſeeking of Honour in Shame, and of Glory in Ignominy. But I paſs by thoſe, who by ſuch ſpeeches clearly diſcover, either that they have not well pondered what they ſay, or (which would be yet worſe) that they hold Truth and Error, Piety and Impiouſneſs, Vertue and Vice, to be indifferent things; ſince, after their reckoning, Pagans and Hereticks are blamable, when they forſake theſe latter, to follow the former; which cannot be affirmed, without maintaining at the leaſt, that both the one and the other are indifferent; in as much as common ſenſe dictateth to all men, that it's a prudent action, worthy of praiſe, and not of blame, to quit the worſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50919:97"/>for the better, and leave a bad way that one may take a good one. I come to thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> who alſo abuſe the Apoſtle's exhorting the faithful, here, and elſwhere, to abide in that which they have received, and which hath been taught them, without giving ear to novelties. This (ſay they) is that you have done, you that walk no longer in the way you were taught amongſt us; that have deſerted and abjured the Maſs, and the Service of our Saints, and the veneration of our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the belief of our Purgatory; and many other ſuch things, which your Anceſtors received; and all which, or the greateſt part of them, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and openly preached among us, from age to age, and from father to ſon, for a thouſand years and more, as your ſelves cannot deny. Dear Brethren, To this I anſwer, That this exhortation of the holy Apoſtle's, is ſo far from favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Cauſe, that quite contrary it overthrows it, and ſets up ours. For, as we have ſaid, He doth not poſitively determine, that every one adhere to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he hath received of his Teachers. GOD forbid; ſince by that means, he ſhould have obliged the Pagan to remain eternally in his Idolatry left him by his Anceſtors; and the Heretick, in the error his Maſters have infus'd into him; and the <hi>Muſulman</hi> in the Faith of his <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and the <hi>Jew</hi> in the tradition of his Fathers. He ſhould, on the contrary exhort the Gentiles to come out of the ways wherein GOD had let themſelves and their Anceſtors walk for the time paſt. He who preſſeth the <hi>Galatians</hi> to forſake the by path whither their Doctors had miſled them, that they might recover the race they once ran; He, who would have <hi>Timothy,</hi> and all true Miniſters,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.25, 26.</note> labour to draw men out of the ſnares of the Devil, whatever hand it was that entangled them in the ſame: He ſpeaks here to faithful people, who had received, and kept pure and ſincere till then, the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST, without any mixture of error or ſuperſtition. It's to theſe he recommends the ſtanding faſt in what they had learned. And if our Adverſaries reſemble them, I confeſs they have reaſon to ſtick in the Doctrine of their Fathers, and we have done ill to recede from it. He ſpeaks not in general of all kind of Doctrine; but particularly, and by name, of that which the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> then believed; to which he expreſly gives theſe two Characters for the diſtinguiſhing of it from all other Doctrines. Firſt, That it wholly referred to JESUS CHRIST. Secondly, That it had been delivered them, either by himſelf, or at leaſt by ſome one of his faithful Diſciples. <hi>So as you have received JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, walk in Him, even as you have been taught.</hi> If ſuch the Doctrine of <hi>Rome</hi> be, if it neither publiſh nor exhibit ought but JESUS CHRIST the Lord; if it were delivered by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> if it came from his hand, if it be derived from his ſpring, I will unfeignedly confeſs, that we are faulty in having quitted it. But ſince, on the contrary, it is evident, and as clear as the light of the Sun, that what we have quitted and abjured, is, not that LORD JESUS CHRIST whom <hi>Paul</hi> and his fellow-labourers and Scholars preached; but a Leaven which is contrary to him, and which hath been ſuperadded by men; nor was taught by the firſt Miniſters of the truth: Who ſeeth not, that we have in this not diſobeyed, but obeyed the Apoſtle's exhortation? that we have done what he commands, and not what he forbids? For in what place of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s or the other Apoſtle's preaching, can they ever ſhew us, that Maſs, and that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and that worſhipping of Saints, and in one word, any of thoſe other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which they retain, and we have relinquiſhed? Every one ſeeth how all theſe things do vary from the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and make void his Croſs, and his Kingdom, cauſing men to ſeek the expiation and purging away of their ſins, other-where than in His Sacrifice; and attributing to Creatures the honour of Invocation, and of preſiding over the whole Church, which belongs to Him alone. But that other mark which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of the Doctrine, which ought to be held faſt, doth leſs yet accord with them; namely, its having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the Apoſtles: it being manifeſt, that not one word of them is found in thoſe holy mens writings, which are the publike and authentick records of what they preached; and that thoſe traditions of <hi>Rome</hi> grew up in after-ages, ſome at one time, ſome at another; iſſuing, by little and little, out of the forges of men, according as error gathered ſtrength; as they know that read the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50919:98"/>of Antiquity without prejudice and prepoſſeſſion. Let our adverſaries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave theſe odious accuſations. They muſt either ſhew, that thoſe Doctrines of theirs which we have relinquiſh'd, are Apoſtolical; or confeſs, that we had reaſon to relinquiſh them: This very command of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, which they are not aſhamed to object to us, neceſſarily obliging us to adhere to that LORD JESUS CHRIST alone, whom he preached, and whom the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> believed on, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his preaching. And it may not be inſiſted on, that the Doctrine, we conteſt with them, hath been their belief for a thouſand years, or more. Time is no preſcription againſt any truth, and leaſt of all againſt the truth of CHRIST and his Apoſtles. That which he hath pronounced, continues in force for ever. If any one preach ought as Goſpel to you,
<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8, 9.</note> beſides what we have preached, were it my ſelf, were it an Angel from Heaven, let him be an <hi>anathema.</hi> I enquire not of what date your opinions are. It is ſufficient for me to anathematize them that were not preached as Goſpel by the Apoſtle. Time cannot have conferred on them the advantage of being true, which they had not at their riſe. What is not now veritable or Apoſtolical, will never be ſo. You are not the only men, among whom Error hath grown old: that groſs one of Idolatry liv'd among the Pagans well nigh Two thouſand years; and their <hi>Rome</hi> hereto alledg'd
<note n="*" place="margin">Symmachus.</note> her hoary hairs, as well as yours doth at this day; and ſaid, as now again <hi>Rome</hi> doth, that it is an Undertaking ill-timed, to correct old age; and that to charge it with error, is to affront thoſe years. It's a thouſand years and more, ſince <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s perfidy hath been up, yet is never a whit the better for that. You your ſelves obſerve Errors in the ſame antiquity, whoſe authority you cry up ſo loud; and you cannot deny, but that thoſe which you condemn in the communions, of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and of the <hi>Cophties,</hi> are very old. It's an extreamly bad defence, when men are convict of error, to ſay, that they have been a long time of that opinion. How ancient ſoever your Doctrine is, it's young in compariſon of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, ſince it was born after his days. Neither its pretended antiquity, nor any other conſideration, can ſecure it from his fulmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Since he would have us keep to that which he preached, without receiving ought beſide; how ſtale and mouldy ſoever with age your traditions can be, they all ought to periſh under pain of an <hi>anathema,</hi> ſeeing they are without the compaſs of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching. We are at this day in the ſame caſe the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> yer while were. They ſtood bound by this exhortation, to reject the worſhipping of Angels, the diſtinction of meats, juſtification by the Law, all that any way tended to add to that LORD JESUS CHRIST, whom they had received from the hand of <hi>Paul,</hi> and who had been taught them by him. Let us then alſo freely reject the ſame things; keep we conſtantly to that JESUS CHRIST, whom we have received of him; who did fill up all his Sermons, and doth ſtill fill up all his Epiſtles. Content we our ſelves with that primitive and truly ancient Doctrine; and boldly deſpiſe all the novelties that the world hath preſum'd to add thereto in after-times. Let us walk, as the Apoſtle gives us order, in this LORD JESUS. Let Him be our only way, the rule of our faith, and of our manners.</p>
                     <p>You know, the Scripture ordinarily uſeth this term, to ſignifie the ordering and conduct of our life. It compareth the various Diſciplines and Perſwaſions which men follow, unto Ways which lead, ſome to one end, ſome to another. For it ſpeaks of the way of ſinners, and of the way of the righteous; meaning thereby the apprehenſions and maxims by which they lead their lives. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſaith, <hi>walk,</hi> to ſignifie living, or leading, and ordering the life. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord and Saviour ſaith, that He is the Way; ſo his Apoſtle enjoineth us to walk in Him; that is, to lead our lives, both in regard of knowledg and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of mind, and alſo in reſpect of affections and actions, according to his holy Goſpel, without any forſaking it, to take another courſe; judging all that varies from it, to be folly, how plauſible ſoever it may appear otherways. And as a prudent and adviſed traveller, never leaves his road, but puts on in it conſtantly, till he come to his journey's end, how ſmiling ſoever the Meadows look, how green and freſh ſoever the ſhades be, how fair and large ſoever the ways are that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50919:98"/>lye in view. In like manner are we ordered to keep continually to the Doctrine of our Lord and Saviour, and not relinquiſh it; or aſſume any other, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or colour, or appearance ſoever it be; ſtill reſolving in our ſelves, that whatſoever is without the dimenſions of this model of Truth, cannot but be dangeorus; and apt, if we follow it, to lead us to perdition. I paſs by the obſervation which ſome make, namely, That the Apoſtle commanding us to walk in CHRIST, doth intimate, we ſhould advance ſtill, and make progreſs therein. For though this conception be for ſubſtance veritable, it being the duty of each true believer to go forward, and not paſs a day without improvement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <p>In theſe words he preſcribeth us three things; Firmneſs of faith, the abounding of the ſame, and giving of thanks. He expreſſeth the firſt, two ways; Firſt, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical terms, <hi>being rooted and built up in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST:</hi> And next, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without figure, <hi>being eſtabliſhed, or confirmed in faith.</hi> For this confirmation in faith, is no other thing, than the ſelf-ſame that he intendeth by the words, <hi>rooted, and built up in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> The firſt of theſe two Metaphors is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Trees, which ſtand firm, and eaſily reſiſt the violence of winds, when they have put forth good and deep roots into the earth; which ſerve them for ſo many ſtays and bands to hold them faſt; whereas the Plants, which have but little or no root, are eaſily pluckt up; the leaſt guſt, yea, the hand of a Child is enough to overthrow them. The faithful are often in Scripture compared unto trees. You all know the Parable of the Fig-tree in the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 92.13, 14</note> and that of the Palm-tree in the Pſalms. <hi>The juſt ſhall flouriſh as the Palm-tree, and grow as the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar in Lebanon.</hi> And there's no one in the Church, but is acquainted with that dainty Tree, planted by the rivers of waters, which bringeth its fruit in its ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the leaves whereof doth not wither;

                        </note> In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe figurative expreſſions, which are familiar in Scripture, you ſee, that it is with much gracefulneſs, and a great deal of reaſon, that the Apoſtle here, to recommend firmneſs of faith in JESUS CHRIST, doth ſay, they ſhould be rooted in Him. He ſaith the ſame again elſewhere, when he prayeth GOD to ſtrengthen the <hi>Epheſians</hi> by his ſpirit,
<note place="margin">Eph. 3.18.</note> 
                        <hi>that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being rooted and founded in love, they might be able to comprehend, with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, the heighth, and depth, and to know the love of Chriſt.</hi> For ſince the faithful man is compared to a tree, it is congruous to attribute to him both the production (that is, fruits), and the parts of a tree, whereof the principal is the root. We ſay then, that a tree is well rooted, when its root is ſpread abroad, and thruſt far into the ground, where it is planted and faſtned to it ſo many ways, that it ſtands upright and firm, nor can be plucked up without extream difficulty. Who then is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever rooted in CHRIST? Even the man whoſe whoſe ſoul embraceth the LORD JESUS; all whoſe thoughts and affections are ſtretch'd forth, and faſtned to this Divine crucified Saviour; who hath neither love, nor deſire, nor affiance, but for Him. It is he, who having rightly underſtood the excellency and the fulneſs of this rich Subject, ſeeks all his felicity in it; and withdrawing the deſires, the cares and affections of his heart from earth, (which are, as it were, the ſtrings and roots of our nature, by which it is faſtned to its objects) doth thruſt them forth towards JESUS CHRIST, doth unite with, and bind them about Him,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50919:99"/>and reſteth on him alone, and draweth the nutriment of his life from none other; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ve, ſhoot forth, and fructifie. Not to alledg any other example, ſuch a one was our <hi>Paul;</hi> ſo faſtned was he unto, and ſo incorporated with his LORD, that he liv'd in Him alone; this divine ground wherein he was planted, affording him all the joy, all the contentment, and all the life he had. There is no need to fear, that thoſe who adhere to JESUS CHRIST in ſuch a manner, who are ſo really and deeply rooted in Him, can ever be pluck'd up by any effort, how violent ſoever it be. The winds do in vain ſhake them; tempeſts do beat upon them to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; perſecutions will not be able to make them bend; nor fraud, nor elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, nor the ſubtilty of Sophiſters, remove them. Novelties and Curioſities do not tempt them; becauſe that ſweet ſap which they continually draw from their CHRIST, as from a rich ſoil, doth content them, and purgeth them of that fooliſh and childiſh itching humour, which openeth the ears of the weak and unſtable, to ſuch things. But if you be not thus rooted in CHRIST, it will be no great difficulty to pluck you from the ſtation you are in. If it be not this heavenly efficacy of our LORD, but either birth, or breeding, or the diſcourſe or authority of men, or the name of liberty, or any other ſuch like cauſe, which keeps you in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, I am much afraid you will not long abide in it. If your heart be in the world, if it ſtill ſpread its affections, as its roots, into periſhing things; if it ſtill admire the pleaſures of the fleſh, and the fumes of ambition, and the vanity of riches, your perſeverance is, in truth, very dubious. The tree that hath no root, hath no hold. The firſt guſt that falls upon it, bears it down. And would to God experience had leſs juſtified this truth in our eyes. But this is the very cauſe of all their change who have deſerted us. If you examine their lives, you will find, they were not well rooted in CHRIST JESUS. Wonder not that they were overthrown. But let us make our profit of their unhappineſs; obeying the Apoſtle. And that we may abide firm for ever in the communion of this Divine LORD of ours, out of which there is nothing but miſery and perdition; let us be rooted in him with a lively and profound faith and love. Let us love and reliſh him only, and inſeparably faſten all the powers of our ſouls to him alone, as dead, and riſen again for us; drawing all our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs from his Croſs, and all our hope and our glory from his Heavenly ſtate, and his immortality.</p>
                     <p>I come to the other Metaphor here uſed by the Apoſtle to ſet forth the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our faith in JESUS CHRIST; <hi>being rooted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and built up in JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> The former was taken from Trees; and this now is drawn from Buildings. It is no leſs famous in Scripture, than the other; for the faithful are there oftentimes compared to Houſes, and particularly to Temples; and the Church, that is, the Society conſiſting of them collectively, is repreſented to us under the ſame image. Whence it comes, that the labours of the Servants of the Lord for this end, are alſo called <hi>edifyings;</hi> a word ſo common in this ſenſe, that there is no need we ſhould ſtay to explain it. And for as much as in material Edifices, it is the Foundation that ſuſtaineth all the Building; thence it comes that the Scripture gives that name to our LORD and Saviour, as to him upon whom this ſpiritual Structure doth entirely depend. <hi>Other foundation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>can no man lay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> 
                        <hi>than that which is laid, even JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> And this the Prophets foretold, in ſaying of him, that <hi>God would ſet in Sion a chief Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi>

                        <hi>elect and precious.</hi> And, <hi>that the ſtone which the builders rejected, ſhould be made head of the corner.</hi> The Apoſtle therefore, deſiring to fortifie his dear <hi>Coloſſians</hi> againſt the danger of falling, proſecuting this figure ſo common in Scripture, commands them to be built up in JESUS CHRIST. And the ſame expreſſion he makes uſe of elſewhere; as when he ſaith, that we <hi>are built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2.20, 21.</note> 
                        <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST himſelf being the chief Corner-ſtone; it whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all the building proportioned and fitly ſet together, riſeth up unto an holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> What is it then to be built up in JESUS CHRIST? Dear Brethren, we ſay an Houſe is builded on a Rock, when a Rock is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that bears and ſuſtains it wholly. A ſoul is builded in JESUS CHRIST,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50919:99"/>when it wholly relieth upon Him; ſo as its Faith, its Hope, its Love, and the other parts of its myſtical ſtructure, are all ſet upon Him, and immediately faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Him; it believeth the Goſpel, becauſe 'tis the word of CHRIST; is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the remiſſion of ſins, becauſe they were expiated by CHRIST; it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the Kingdom of Heaven, becauſe he purchas'd it; loveth neighbours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are his workmanſhip; meekly beareth affliction, becauſe it is a part of his Croſs: in ſum, layeth and ſetleth upon him alone the deſigns, the thoughts, the enjoyments, and the expectations, wherein conſiſteth both its preſent life, and that which is to come. One ſo built up in JESUS CHRIST, is right that wiſe man, commended by our Saviour's own mouth,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.24, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </note> who buildeth his Houſe on a Rock, ſo as no violence is able to effect its fall. For indeed, what can overthrow a ſoul ſeated on this Rock of Ages, which is ſo firm, and unmoveable for ever? Where is the tentation, or the perſecution, that can beat it down? What is built upon this Foundation, is not ſubject to natural accidents. It's a celeſtial and an eternal Ediſice. But the miſery of men, and the true cauſe of their weakneſs and ruin, is, that they build elſewhere, either wholly, or for the greateſt part. The World is the ground whereon they ſet, and raiſe up the deſigns of their lives; and this ground being nought but weak and floating Sand, the firſt force that aſſaults them, brings them down, and <hi>their fall</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>is great.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Apoſtle expreſſeth in proper terms, what he had repreſented under theſe two Metaphors; adding, <hi>and eſtabliſhed in faith.</hi> For it is properly by faith that we are rooted in JESUS CHRIST; and 'tis by it alſo that we are founded and built up in him; all theſe phraſes ſignifying only the ſpiritual union and conjunction which we have with the LORD, the ſole tye whereof faith is. Let us labour therefore continually to confirm our faith, if we would reſiſt the enemy. Let us meditate the truth of the Goſpel, ſtudy all its myſteries, taſte the excellency of it. Let us carefully hear and read that word wherein GOD hath reveal'd it to us. By it faith hath its being, as the Apoſtle tells us;
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> 
                        <hi>Faith comes of hearing, and bearing of the word of God.</hi> Whence you may judg, how contrary to the Apoſtle's injunction, the command of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, who will not grant, that the faithful ſhould read Scripture. How ſhall they be confirmed in faith, if they have no commerce with this ſacred word, the only parent and nurſe of faith? How again can they, without it, acquit themſelves in that which the Apoſtle commands, in the ſecond place, even that we abound in faith? It is not enough that we be eſtabliſhed in it, that we have of it for neceſſity; he would have us furniſh'd even unto plenty; poſſeſs'd of a great and rich meaſure of it: have this ſacred light to go on, ſtill encreaſing, and augmenting, as he ſaith elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, from faith to faith. Some are of the mind, that this word muſt be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not ſingly to the thing, but alſo to the ſentiment that we have of it. As if the Apoſtle's meaning were, when he ſpeaks of abounding in faith, that we ſhould account our ſelves to have abundantly, in the faith of JESUS CHRIST alone, all the ſaving-knowledg we can deſire, without needing the addition of ought any other way. This expoſition is elegant and ingenious, and very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Apoſtle's deſign. But becauſe it is followed by few, and the former is more ſimple, I will not inſiſt upon it.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Apoſtle adds, in the third and laſt place, giving of thanks; <hi>abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in faith,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with thanksgiving.</hi> His ſcope is, that we do tenderly reſent the excellency and plenty of the benefits which are communicated to us by the Goſpel; and do remember the ſpring whence they flow, to wit, the ſole Grace of GOD; who, taking us out of the darkneſs of error and ignorance wherein we were plunged, hath made us enter into the Kingdom of Light, by the power of his Word and Spirit; that we may continually render him our grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of it. Beſides that this duty is moſt reaſonable of it ſelf, it is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enſure the faith of the Goſpel unto us: For as on the one hand GOD augmenteth his gifts to the thankful; ſo he taketh them away from the unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, withdrawing his light from their ſouls, and giving them up to themſelves; as you know he threatneth ingrateful Churches to take his Candleſtick from them. And the Apoſtle informs us elſewhere, that to them who receiv'd not the love
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50919:100"/>of the truth, he ſendeth the efficacy of error, ſo as they believe a lye; which is the moſt dreadful puniſhment, wherewith he avengeth himſelf on the iniquity of men. Dear Brethren, that we fall not into ſo diſmal a judgment, let us poſſeſs this treaſure of knowledg which GOD hath given us in his Son, with all the gratitude we can; humbly bleſſing him, for that he hath vouchſafed to impart a thing ſo precious, and of ſuch ſaving-importance unto us; to us, I ſay, who were ſo unworthy of it. Let it be all our love, and all our glory. Let others boaſt of their might, and their skill; of their riches, and their greatneſs. As for us, glory we only in the knowledg of GOD, and of his holy Goſpel, the ſole ſupream hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of man. Let us be jealous of this holy Doctrine, keeping it pure, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and carefully taking heed of the Leaven of Superſtition and Error. Let us be content with our LORD JESUS CHRIST the Prince of Life, and with that fulneſs of grace we have received, and the holy Apoſtles preached. Mix no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forreign with it. To add to it, is to accuſe it of imperfection and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. Inſtead of loſing time in the inventions of Error, and in the laborious, but childiſh exerciſes of Superſtition. Let us employ all hours in good and holy works; walking in JESUS CHRIST; rooting, and building up our ſelves more and more in him; eſtabliſhing our ſelves, and abounding in faith; and teſtifying, and proving the truth of it, by a pure piouſneſs towards GOD, and an ardent love towards our Neighbour; by the fervency of our Prayers, the liberality of our Alms, the humility of our Deportments, the modeſty of our Perſons, the hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, juſtneſs, and integrity of all our Words and Actions, to the glory of the LORD JESUS, whom we ſerve, and own for our Maſter; to the edification of men, and our own ſalvation. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, comparing the ſociety of his faithful ones, in the tenth Chapter of S. <hi>John,</hi> to a Flock of Sheep, doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe us, that there are Thieves, who coaſt about this myſtical Fold; and do come only to ſteal, to kill, and to deſtroy; as alſo, that there are Wolves which take away and ſcatter the Sheep. You are not ignorant, dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that under the names of theſe ſpiritual Thieves and Wolves, he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto us evil Spirits, and the falſe Teachers whom they ſet on work; who both together earneſtly promote the ſame deſign, though by divers means, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the debauching and alienating of the faithful from the Communion of JESUS CHRIST, their only Paſtor; getting them, and appropriating them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the Thief, who takes what is another's, and makes it his own. Whence enſues their death and deſtruction. For as the Wolf kills the Sheep he hath ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo theſe Miniſters of Satan do bereave of life thoſe whom they pull away
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50919:100"/>from the Flock of Chriſt, out of whoſe communion there is nothing but death and perdition. But theſe wretched workers do employ (as I ſaid) many different means to compaſs their cruel and bloody deſign. Some they take away by down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right force, making them leave the boſome of the Church, by the violence of perſecutions; or drawing them into the world, by the pleaſures of the fleſh; and do bring them, even to a renouncing of the very Name of JESUS CHRIST the Prince of Life. Againſt others, they make uſe of fraud, training them forth, and diſtancing them by little and little from JESUS CHRIST, under fair and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretences; ſo as in the end, they have nothing of his left them but a name; and a vain unprofitable profeſſion, remaining indeed under the power, and in the poſſeſſion of his Enemy. It's againſt theſe myſtical Thieves, and Robbers, that the Apoſtle doth awaken the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> in the Text we have read, exhorting them to take heed of 'em.

                     <p>For it is the duty of a good Paſtor, ſuch a one as the Apoſtle was, not only to ſeed the myſtical Sheep, which the chief Shepherd hath committed to his care, by giving them the pure and wholſom doctrine of the Goſpel, the only paſture of ſouls; but alſo to preſerve them, with all his power, from the paws of Wolves, and the hands of Robbers; advertiſing them of the danger, and dextrouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them out of it, by the ſaving-tone of his voice. But as your Paſtors are obliged to this care, ſo you ſee, dear Brethren, that it is your duty to watch for your own ſafety; to open your eyes and ſenſes, that ye may diſcern a ſtranger from a domeſtick, a thief from the ſhepherd, the hand of a robber from that of a friend. <hi>Beware,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to you. He would not have the faithful be ſilly ſheep, that let themſelves be led away by the firſt commer, and indifferently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all that is offer'd them. His will is, that we have our ſenſes exerciſed and habituated in diſcerning between truth and falſhood; able to prove all things, that we may hold faſt what is good, and not ſuffer our ſelves to be ſurpriſed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the dignity of a Robe, or the blaze of Wit, or ſome appearances of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; ſeeing, that Angels of Satan do ſometimes clothe themſelves with light. The prudence of the <hi>Beraeans</hi> is praiſed by the Holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">Acts 17.11.</note> who examined S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching, comparing what he had ſpoken to them, with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they might aſſuredly know the ſtate of the matter. The ſalvation of our ſouls is too precious for us to truſt any other than GOD in it. Whence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, how dangerous that ſecurity of implicit faith, as they call it, is; which, without any ſcruple, receives all that its Teachers deliver; and is ſo far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining it, that it vouchſafes not ſo much as to underſtand it; believing it true, without knowing it; provided only that the mouth which publiſheth it, hath been opened by the Pope's hand. If the queſtion were only of a title, thoſe of whom the Apoſtle adviſeth the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> here to take heed, were Teachers; and he conteſteth not with them about their dignity, in any part of this Epiſtle: He deals with them only about their Doctrine. Accordingly the caſe is concerning Doctrine, whether we ought to believe it, or no; and whatever may be the hand that delivereth it to us, if it be falſe, it will not fail to deſtroy us; as poyſon doth not forbear to kill, though he that preſcribed it, hath taken his degrees with all the formalities requiſite. S. <hi>Paul</hi> too elſewhere, with one word overthrows all the prepoſſeſſions that might be for any Preachers, upon any ever ſo eminent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their perſons, when he proclaims twice together, <hi>If we our ſelves,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> 
                        <hi>or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from heaven, do preach another Goſpel to you, beſide what we have preached, let him be an Anathema.</hi> Be you all that you will, you cannot be more than S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or an Angel of Heaven. Since their Doctrine ought to be examined by the Goſpel, for its having reception, or being accurſed, as it ſhould be found conform, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50919:101"/>thereto, it will be no wrong done you, if yours be put to the ſame trial.</p>
                     <p>But conſider, I pray, with what emphaſis the Apoſtle recommendeth to us the importance of this duty. <hi>Beware</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leſt any man make prey of you.</hi> He could not, more to the life, or with greater elegancy, expreſs the danger of ſuch as ſtand not on their guard, than by this word, which ſignifies properly to carry away the booty that a man hath taken. It is not without cauſe (ſaith he) that I give you order to uſe all your abilities, and to defend your ſelves againſt Error with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt vigilancy. For no ſmall matter depends upon it. It is as much as your ſouls, your ſelves, and the nobleſt part of your beeing, your underſtandings, your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, your heart comes to. The Wolves, and the Thieves, againſt whom men watch with ſo much care, do aim only at their Sheep, or their Purſe. Thoſe, againſt whom I animate you, aim at your Perſons. An Enemy, againſt whom Cities and States do ſet guards, doth threaten only their Goods, or their Lives at moſt. He againſt whom I require your watching, ſeeketh your ſouls, and the ſhare they have in eternity. You are the Workmanſhip, and the Jewel of the LORD of Glory. You will be a prey to Satan and his Miniſters, if you fall into their ſnares. They will not be content with having taken you; they will bring you into bondage; and the redeemed of JESUS CHRIST, whoſe liberty he hath bought at the price of his Divine Blood, will become ſlaves of men, and which is worſe, of Devils. Good GOD! how piercing was the eye of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirit, which guided the Pen of this Apoſtle!

For Error is ever inſolent; and whereas Preachers of the Truth do ſerve thoſe whom they teach, and ſtile themſelves their Miniſters, as this Apoſtle here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore did; the Teachers of Falſhood uſurp dominion over thoſe whom they have corrupted, and vaunt, that they are their Judges, their Maſters, and their Lords. S <hi>Paul</hi> noted it long ſince of the ſeducers of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who, as he ſaith,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.20.</note> enſlaved them, devoured them, and exalted themſelves over them, and ſmote them on the face; that is, did put all kind of indignities upon them. And the falſe Teachers among the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 6.13.</note> he ſaith, did glory in the fleſh of their miſerable diſcriples. They are blind that do not at this day obſerve the ſelf-ſame thing in the carriage of thoſe men that reign over all the multitude whom they have deceived; and rear up lofty Trophies of every poor ſoul that they have made prey of. Dear Brethren, if you love the liberty which the LORD JESUS hath purchaſed for you; if you abhor the ſervitude of men; if you deſire the fruit of the one, which is immortality; and deteſt perdition, the inevitable ſequel of the other; in the name of GOD, take heed that no man make prey of you. The Doctrine of truth is encloſed within the LORD's ſheepfold. Abide there, if you would be in ſafety. Stray you thence but ever ſo little, and you will fall into the hands of Wolves and Robbers. Hearken not unto their babble. Be not taken with their countenance. Let any thing among them that may promiſe fair, be ſuſpected of you, ſince their ſeeking only is, to withdraw you from the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Now the Apoſtle points at three things here, which he adviſeth us to take heed of in particular; namely, The vain deceit of Philoſophy: The traditions of men: and, The rudiments of the world: Becauſe theſe were the three ſources from which thoſe falſe Apoſtles, that then attempted the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> drew all the heads of their Doctrine, and the means which they uſed to colour it, and give it that vain luſtre which was needful for the beguiling of the ſimple and unlearned. For,
<note place="margin">Col. 2.23.</note> as we ſhall ſee more particularly in the ſequel of this Chapter, they enjoined the worſhipping of Angels; a matter they had taken, in all likelihood, out of the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50919:101"/>Sinks of the <hi>Platonick</hi> Philoſophers, who ſtoried divers things of theſe higher ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and of their interpoſition, and mediation between GOD and us, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of us, and the rendring us capable of ſupream happineſs; as we ſee even at this day, in thoſe remains which we have of their Writings. Again,
<note place="margin">Col. 2.23.</note> they introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced divers voluntary devotions, which did not ſpare the fleſh, and ſeem'd full of humility; but were indeed only traditions of men, without any foundation in the word of GOD. Finally, it is alſo evident, that they preſſed the obſervation of days, and the diſtinction of meats, according to the ordinances of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, which are likewiſe ſtiled Elements of the World. Now though theſe three points do particularly reſpect the falſe Teachers at <hi>Coloſs,</hi> yet they are common well-nigh to all ſuch as ever ſet themſelves to alter and ſophiſticate the Goſpel; the moſt part of their impoſtures having iſſued from one of theſe three ſprings. We will conſider them therefore briefly and diſtinctly, by the will of God; and after them, the character or mark which S. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth them, to wit, <hi>that theſe things are not after CHRIST.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among theſe things, of which we are to beware, he gives the firſt place to Philoſophy. It's name is very honourable; Philoſophy, if you weigh the word, ſignifying the love and purſuit of wiſdom. But the corruptneſs of thoſe men that gave their Profeſſion this name among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> did diſgrace ſo worthy a term, and made it to be the name of a Tool of Error and Impoſture, rather than of an Inſtrument of Science and Truth. For the common ſort of thoſe that ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves Philoſophers, amuſed themſelves altogether in vain Speculations, in a trade of ſubtilty and ſyllogizing, and in endleſs diſputes, that yeelded men no true profit. They thought they had attained the End of their profeſſion, when they had got a faculty to ſpeak of all matters, with ſome colour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, ſo as to dazle the eyes of the ignorant, and win the admiration of the half-witted. This vanity rendred them odious, firſt among the Pagans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; where they went, among the people, for extravagant perſons, and were in little better eſteem among the greater part of the better ſort. And for as much as of all Profeſſions ſcarce any did more fiercely oppoſe the Goſpel of our Saviour; thence it came to paſs, that the firſt Chriſtians alſo conceiv'd a very ill opinion of them; which encreas'd, when it did appear that Hereticks did ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fetch from theſe mens Forges, the Arms they uſed to offend the Faith of the Church, and to defend their own Inventions.
<note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> This induced one of the moſt ancient Chriſtian Writers, to call them the Patriarchs of Hereticks; and to ſay, that all Hereſies are maintained by their rules, and animated with their ſpirit, and do lodg in their thickets and buſhments, as in their ſtrong hold. He calls them Animals of glory: and all Chriſtian Antiquity treats them very courſly, as we underſtand by what is left us of the Books or that time; wherein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Philoſophy is accounted ſo dangerous, that it hath been charged upon ſome as a great crime to have but look'd into <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Books, and learned his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick. On the other ſide, we meet with Fathers alſo, who have high eſteem of Philoſophy; and it cannot be denied, but that even they that blame it, do make uſe of it, and many times with good ſucceſs, and much to purpoſe. It's not my deſign to break up this queſtion, or to produce here all that may be ſaid, either for Philoſophy, or againſt it. The holy Apoſtle doth not oblige me to it; as who blameth here, not the ſubſtance thereof, but the ill uſe of it which falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made, employing it either to the inventing, or the defending of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: this he evidently ſheweth, by that having ordered us to take heed that none make prey of us by Philoſophy, he adds immediately, <hi>and by vain deceit;</hi> by theſe words limiting, what he had generally uttered; and giving us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he rejected not the uſe of Philoſophy, but when it was made to ſerve Error and Impoſture. We muſt therefore here, as in all other ſubjects, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtinguiſh the abuſe from the thing it ſelf, and the ſubſtance from what is acceſſary to it, and the truth from that error which is ſuperadded thereto by the wickedneſs or weakneſs of men. For there is not a thing in the world ſo good, and ſo laudable in its own nature, but our Vices do foul it, in handling the ſame. Intemperance hath defamed Wine, Meats, and Spices: Luxury, Gold, Silver,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50919:102"/>Precious Stones, Silk, and Perfumes; all of them Creatures of GOD, very good, and very excellent. Cruelty, Murther, and Parricide, have defiled Iron, a moſt neceſſary inſtrument of our life; and Fire, which we cannot be without, hath often ſerved the rage and the injuſtice of Tyrants. What is there more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than Beauty, among the ornaments of the body? and then Eloquence, among the ornaments of the mind? Yet they frequently become, through the corruption of men, means of debauchery and ſeduction. Not ſo much as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves, the moſt ſalutiferous effect of the goodneſs of GOD, but are ſometimes profaned by error and vice; ignorance and levity wreſting them to mens own ruin, and wretchedly turning that to deſtruction which was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but for our ſalvation. It is not meant, that upon this pretence we ſhould caſt off a due uſing of any of the works of God, who, being infinitely wiſe, hath made nothing but is uſeful. By this account it would not be lawful to make uſe of any thing, ſince there is nothing which viciouſneſs and ignorance doth not abuſe. I ſay the ſame of Philoſophy. If its Authors among the Pagans, if Hereticks among Chriſtians, have made it ſerve the intereſt of error, it follows not, that it muſt be totally rejected; nor ſhould we do as the man, that rooted up his Vines, becauſe having taken too much of the fruit of them, he was overcharged with it; or as he, who would have his Roſe-buſhes burned, becauſe he had been ſometimes prick'd in gathering their Flowers. All that may be thence conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is, that this plant muſt be diſcreetly handled; the fruit enjoyed, but with moderation; the flowers gathered, but with heed taken of the thorns. This is all the Apoſtle forbids us in it, even deceit, and not inſtruction; that in it which is vain, and not what is found to be ſolid; Error and Sophiſtry, not Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Ratiocination. Philoſophy it ſelf doth waſh its hands of its Diſciples faults. It diſavows their Errors, and renounceth all that they have brought forth, without its direction, by ill arguing, how great ſoever otherways their reputation be. It is ſo far from defending them, that it ſelf affords us weapons wherewith to combat them, and offers us its lights to diſcover the weakneſs of their falſe diſcourſes. For it hath obſerved and taught the rules of legitimate Reaſoning, with ſuch admirable skill, that there is no falſhood to be met with, but it gives us a conviction of. So as if error be in the diſcourſes of men of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (as without doubt there is no ſmall meaſure) it is certain, that in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy production they have ſwerved from their own rule; it being impoſſible that a falſhood ſhould ever be duly and rightly concluded from truth Whence it follows, that no error or doctrine contrary to truth, is, to ſpeak properly, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, it is an abuſe of it. It may well be an imagination, and an extravagance of the Phil ſopher; not a part, or a true fruit of Philoſophy. And when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith here, that Hereticks make a prey of men by Philoſophy; that is (as he addeth) by a vain deception: he takes the word <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as the vulgar doth, for the accuſtomed and ordinary diſcourſes of Philoſophers, and not for true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and that which is properly ſo called. As long as the Philoſopher care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keeps within the bounds of his faculty, and tranſgreſſeth them not, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth, and doth not deceive. The bounds of Philoſophy, which it hath ſet it ſelf, are, the things that may be known by the light of natural reaſon. While it keeps this road, it travels ſecurely; and, I confeſs, what it teacheth in this kind, may do good ſervice to the Goſpel; ſo far would it be from claſhing with it. For who ſees not, that its diſcoveries of the nature of Plants, of living Creatures, of Metals and Meteors, of the tranſmutation of Elements, the motions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, of Times and Seaſons, of the concatenation of inferior Cauſes with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, and the Concluſion it raiſeth from this Contemplation, That there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Univerſe an Inviſible, Eternal, moſt Wiſe, and Almighty GOD, upon whom it all depends; who ſeeth not, I ſay, that this is laudable, and excellent, and nothing in effect but a report of the handy-work of GOD, and a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating of his Divinity? If the Philoſopher had ſtaid him there, and deduced nothing thence but this clear conſequence, That the ſame Supream Beeing, whoſe ſootſteps and whoſe glory he had perceiv'd in his works, ought to be ſupreamly adored, ſerved, ſought, and loved; never had the Apoſtle ordered us to be afraid
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50919:102"/>of Philoſophy; for he himſelf makes uſe of ſuch diſcourſe,
<note place="margin">Acts 14. &amp; 17.</note> when he ſpeaks to the Gentiles, as you may ſee in his Oration to the <hi>Lycaonians,</hi> and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in the <hi>Acts;</hi> and he doth elſewhere evidently confirm it, when he ſaith, That <hi>GOD hath made manifeſt unto men, what may be known of Him;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1.19, 20</note> and that <hi>His eternal Power and Godhead, inviſible in themſelves, are yet viſibly ſeen by the creation of the world,</hi> they being conſidered in His works. But the miſery is, that the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, being carried away with that vanity and curioſity, which was natural to them, broke thoſe bounds, and would needs define things which are beyond that compaſs; and about which Reaſon, in the ſtate we now are, ſees not one jot. And here it is, they neceſſarily fell into error and extravagancies; as perſons born blind would do, ſhould they intrude to diſcourſe to us of colours. Such are the Fancies of <hi>Plato</hi> and his Scholars, concerning the eſtate of the ſouls of men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from their bodies, concerning the purifications he deviſed to convey us near the Supream Good: concerning the interpoſition of Daemons (is he calleth them) that is Angels (as the Scripture terms them), to preſent our ſupplications to GOD; and concerning the ſervice which he ordained to be done them, in conſequence of this good office; and a thouſand other ſuch like things. Such alſo was the miſtake of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when not content to underſtand the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the World, he would know what it was in the beginning, wherein he had no light at all; concluding, becauſe in the ſtate things now are, of nothing nothing is made, that therefore it was never otherwiſe; and thereupon affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a certainty, that the World is eternal. As if we muſt needs judg of the firſt beginning of a thing, by thoſe Laws under which it lives after its ſettlement; and ſhould limit the power of a free Agent, to the meaſure of the effect wrought; that is, as if, becauſe GOD, in this frame of the World, doth make now nothing without Matter, therefore it followed, that abſolutely he could make nothing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; which is as impertinent a reaſoning, as if you ſhould inferr, that becauſe a Painter hath wrought his pieces with three or four colours only, it were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to draw, or repreſent any thing any otherways. In this particular Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy hath offended by exceſs, undertaking more than it could compaſs. It often erreth likewiſe by defect, when it rejects the revelation of GOD, as reſolved to admit nothing that is above its own ſenſe and reaſon; as if a man that had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen any other than the ſhining of our Fires, and our Candles, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, there was no other light in the world. Pride hath made the greateſt part of the old Philoſophers to fall into this impiety. It ſeemed to them an abaſing of their glory, to acknowledg there was another School more knowing than theirs; and that it was an injury to tell them, GOD had diſcovered ſecrets to others, which he had hid from them. It was this vanity that ſpurr'd them on ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently againſt the Goſpel of our LORD and Saviour at the beginning. If Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy do modeſtly keep its rank; if it be content with its bounds, and not thruſt away nor injure divine Revelation; if it acknowledg it as its Miſtris, and be ſubject to it, as <hi>Agar</hi> yerwhile was to <hi>Sarah,</hi> welcom be it; it may be received, and may abide with us. But if it uſurp, if it will needs be Miſtris, and command in a Family, where it hath only the quality of a Bond-woman, let it depart, and be treated according to <hi>Sarah</hi> her ſpeech to <hi>Abraham; Drive out the bond-woman and her ſon.</hi> GOD hath vouchſafed to reveal unto us by his Prophets, and in the laſt times by his own Son, all the Articles of Religion. Philoſophy ought to adore them with us. It hath nothing to enjoin us in the matter. From the mouth of GOD, not from the mouth of Philoſophy, do we receive Religion. As often therefore as Teachers of Error ſhall uſe the authority or artifice of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, to render their inventions plauſible or probable in our eyes, let us boldly deſpiſe all their ſubtilty. Let not the names of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> make us afraid; let not their petty ſubtilties dazzle our ſight. We may hear them, when queſtion is only of men, and of nature. When GOD and his ſervice is concern'd, we ought to give ear to none but GOD, and the Son of his love, about whom he hath proclaimed from Heaven to us, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him.</hi> It's this the Apoſtle doth intend, when he ſaith here, <hi>Let no man make a prey of you by Philoſophy.</hi> But, provided the Doctrine of our Lord and Saviour do
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50919:103"/>remain ſound and entire, without diminution, without augmentation or mixture, we are not prohibited the ſervice of Philoſophy; but may employ its Phyſicks, and its Ethicks, to confirm and illuſtrate, as far as they can, the truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; its Logick, to defend them againſt the Sophiſms and Sleights of gain-ſayers; and, in ſum, to adorn and embelliſh them, we may uſe ought of worth that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy doth afford; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> heretofore adorned the Sanctuary of GOD, with the Gold, and Silver, and Jewels of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Whence you may ſee, how in the diſputes of Religion which we have with thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> they for their part do evidently abuſe Philoſophy; whereas we duly employ it, they abuſe it: For, not to ſay, that they make <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reign in their Divinity-School, regarding his Edicts, and cheriſhing much jealouſie of his reputation, as if he were a Pillar of Religion; they found Articles of their Faith upon the authority of the Sages of the world; as when they prove their Purgatory by the teſtimony of <hi>Plato;</hi> and the veneration of Images by the cuſtom of Nations; and Free-will, by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: and divers other things of like nature; which being not to be found in the Scriptures of GOD, they go ſeek them in the Writings of men. As for us, it is evident, we have no poſitive Article in our Faith, but what is in the Goſpel. Only when our Adverſaries urge their <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> upon us; having ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that GOD hath no where revealed it to us in his word, but even clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted it, we call in Philoſophy its ſelf to our ſuccour, to evidence the abſurdity thereof: We produce its teſtimony in a caſe which clearly is of its cognizance; namely, the nature of an human body, the place it takes up, the quantity to which it is extended, the quality of ſubſtantial mutations; of which kind they pretend this is, Whether a body made and formed Sixteen hundred years ago, may ſtill be every day ſubſtantially produced.</p>
                     <p>But it is high time to come to the two other Sources of the deceits of falſe Teachers. The ſecond is the Tradition of men, as the Apoſtle calls it. <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that none do make prey of you by Philoſophy and vain deceit, after the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men.</hi> The Scripture commonly gives the name of Traditions to thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which we receive from ſome other. And it frequently uſeth the word <hi>deliver</hi> (whence, in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, that of <hi>Tradition</hi> is derived) for to inſtruct or teach. <hi>I received of the LORD</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that which I delivered unto you;</hi> that is, taught. It therefore calls thoſe Doctrines Traditions of men, which have men only for their authors, which come from men, and not from GOD. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that errors derived from that Philoſophy, whereof he ſpake even now, may alſo bear the ſame name, ſince they ſlowed from the ſpirit of man, and had no other ſource than his imagination; yet the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth the one from the others, for two reaſons, as I conceive. Firſt, Foraſmuch as theſe had ſome colour of abſtruſe wiſdom, being ſprung from ſpeculations, in ſhew, ſublime and excellent; though, in reality, vain and frivolous; whereas the Doctrines which he here calleth Traditions, had no foundation at all, but the authority of thoſe that ſet them up, and the uſage of thoſe that practis'd them; they being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways far from all Philoſophical reaſons, not only true and ſolid, but alſo probable. Secondly, Becauſe they had had ſome ſucceſſive continuance among the people of GOD, having been deliver'd by the Phariſees, and other Zealots of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> from father to ſon, in a ſeries of no ſmall length; whereas that which he calls the deceit of Philoſophy, was not deliver'd in that manner, but lately invented by theſe new Teachers, and taken from the dreams of ſome Philoſophers. Whence it doth appear, that no productions or inſtitutions of an human ſpirit, are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in Evangelical Religion; neither thoſe that are ſupported by ſome pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reaſons; nor thoſe that are founded upon uſe and antiquity. They are all of them nothing but folly and vanity in the ſight of GOD, with what colour ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be painted over. And though men boaſt of their utility, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hurtful, as peſtring Conſciences, and buſying them about things which GOD hath not ordained; and turning them aſide from his pure ſervice, to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of nought. Accordingly you ſee, that our LORD JESUS CHRIST rejects, and roughly thruſts away all the traditions of the Phariſees, how much eſteem'd ſoever they were for their antiquity, and pretended uſe; reproaching them, that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50919:103"/>by holding faſt thoſe Traditions of men, they did let looſe the Commandments of GOD, and applying to them thoſe words of the LORD in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mark 7.8. Iſa. 29.13.</note> 
                        <hi>In vain do they honour me, teaching Doctrines, which are the commandments of men.</hi> As indeed its an unſufferable preſumption, that man ſhould attempt to preſcribe the form of GOD's ſervice; eſpecially after the declaration, which himſelf hath vouchſafed to make of his holy will; nor is there one among men, that would endure his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould treat him in that manner; and inſtead of obeying his Orders, and cauſing others to diſpatch them, fall a Philoſophiſing in his houſe, and giving his Family a new rule to obſerve, as if he were wiſer than his Maſter: I know well, the authors of theſe Traditions, and thoſe that follow them, are not without fine reaſons to palliate their temerity. But it is evident, that they do the very ſame, for ſubſtance; neither is it to be doubted, but a ſervant that ſhould be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch a vanity, would alledg likewiſe his motive and deſigns, to any that would give him audience. But common ſenſe dictateth to the meaneſt capacities, that ſuch undertaking-ſpirits merit not ſo much as to be heard; eſpecially where GOD is concern'd; in compariſon of whom, they, with all their ſufficiency; are but poor worms of the earth. Hold we firm therefore this foundation of the Apoſtle, That the Traditions of men ought to have no place in Religion. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me not to inform my ſelf of their age, whether they be the traditions of men ancient or modern. It ſufficeth that I know they are Traditions of men. Having the Apoſtle's advertiſement, we ſhould not be moved with any reaſon, or ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, or antiquity they may come clothed with. If you would have me receive them, ſhew me, that they are Preſcriptions of GOD, Inſtitutions of his CHRIST, Doctrines of his Scriptures. Without this, how ſpecious ſoever you make them appear to me, I ſhall ever believe, it is but to make prey of me; and your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhall have no effect, but the making me ſuſpect them ſo much the more.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Apoſtle addeth a third Source, whence the Seducers drew both their Doctrine, and the means to colour it; namely, that which he calls the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world. I paſs by the opinion of thoſe, who refer theſe words to the Elements of Nature, Water, Air, Earth, and Fire; as if the Apoſtle here did tax theſe falſe Teachers, of reducing the ſervice of them which was then in full vogue among the Heathen; theſe wretched Idolaters having yerſt deified all the parts of the Univerſe. There is not a word in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Writings, either here, or elſewhere, that leadeth us to ſuch a conceit; and it is not very likely, that the perſons he here aims at, ſhould authorize ſo brutal a kind of Idolatry; perſons, who covered themſelves with the Name of JESUS CHRIST, and made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at leaſt in ſhew, of retaining his Goſpel. It is clear, that the Apoſtle in other places, doth mean, by the <hi>Elements of the world,</hi> not theſe primigenial, and more ſimple ſubſtances, out of which all natural generations are framed; but the ceremonies and carnal ſervices of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, under which the ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lived, until the revelation of the Meſſiah. <hi>When we were children</hi> (ſaith he;
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.3, 9.</note> and you know he calleth all that time the Childhood of the Church, wherein it was under the Pedagogie of <hi>Moſes) we were in bondage under the elements of the world;</hi> and a little after, in contempt, he ſtileth them, <hi>poor and weak elements,</hi> whereto the <hi>Galatians</hi> would embondage themſelves. Now it is evident, the error of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> was, that they would ſtill be ſubject to the Ceremonial Law. Here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Text, he uſeth the ſame word in the ſame ſenſe: <hi>If you be dead with CHRIST</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>unto the elements of the world, why are you burden'd with Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances?</hi> There is then no doubt, but that in this place he doth, in like manner, ſignifie ſtill the ſame thing, by theſe words, that is to ſay, the obſervations and devotions of the Ceremonial Law. And in effect, we ſhall ſee hereafter, that theſe ſeducers whom he combateth in this Chapter, would hold faſt that Law, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole or in part, ſubjecting the faithful to circumciſion, and divers regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations about meats and days. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them, <hi>Elements,</hi> or (as our Bibles have rendred it in ſome places) <hi>the rudiments of the world;</hi> becauſe they were the firſt and the loweſt leſſons the Church had, during the time of its Childhood; they were as its Alphabet. For the word [<hi>Elements</hi>] is often ſo taken; namely, for the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50919:104"/>firſt leſſons, wherein they are taught to know their Letters; which are alſo call'd <hi>Elements,</hi> becauſe in ſpeech words are made up of them, even as natural bodies are formed of thoſe firſt and more ſimple ſubſtances, which we properly call <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And he calls the Jewiſh Church, the World; becauſe its eſtate, and its worſhip, was groſs, and terrene, and in ſome ſort worldly, in compariſon of that of the new <hi>Iſreal,</hi> whom the LORD formed to worſhip GOD in ſpirit and in truth. Whence it comes, that he calls all the knowledg of the Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,

                        <hi>the wiſdom of this generation;</hi> and thoſe Rabbies themſelves, <hi>the Princes of this generation;</hi> that is, of this world. Thus, how hoary-headed and venerable ſoever the age of theſe rudiments of the world was, the Apoſtle would not that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhould ſuſſer themſelves to be taken, under that pretence, by thoſe ſeducers that advanced the obſervation of them. Behold, what were thoſe three colours wherewith theſe men be-painted their Doctrine; The vain ſpeculations of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; The antiquity of Tradition; and, The authority of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies!</p>
                     <p>To which the Apoſtle adds, <hi>and not after CHRIST.</hi> By theſe very few words, as with one blow, he beateth down all the ſpeciouſneſs of theſe ſtrange Doctrines: Let men trick them up (ſaith he) as much as they will; let them colour them with the ſubtilities of Philoſophy; let the practiſe of them be authorized by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; let them be recommended under the name of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the reſpect we owe to the rudiments of the former world; all this hinders not, but that we ought to deſpiſe them, not only as unprofitable, but even as dangerous, ſince they are <hi>not after CHRIST.</hi> He ſaith, they are <hi>not after CHRIST;</hi> Firſt, Becauſe the LORD JESUS hath told us nothing of them in his Goſpel; whence it appears, that we have good ground to reject from our belief all that is not found in the Scriptures of the New-Teſtament. Secondly, Becauſe the Doctrine of JESUS CHRIST is wholly ſpiritual and celeſtial; whereas thoſe traditions and legal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations were groſs and carnal. And laſtly, Becauſe, beſides their having no correſpondency with the nature of the Goſpel, they do turn men aſide from the LORD JESUS, cauſing them to ſeek ſome part of their ſalvation otherwhere than in Him; in whom it is ſo entirely ſeated, as not the leaſt drop of it is to be had in any other. And what ſhew ſoever ſuch as follow theſe Traditions do make, of being reſolv'd to retain JESUS CHRIST, experience lets us ſee, that they do but very ſlightly ſtick to him; buſying themſelves wholly in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their own devotions, and placing the greateſt part of their confidence in the ſame; which comes from hence, even that theſe are more grateful to them, both for their novelty, and for their being voluntary, and indeed of leſs difficulty; it being much eaſier to the fleſh, to acquit it ſelf of ſome external and corporeal obſervances, than to embrace JESUS CHRIST with a lively faith, dying to the world, and living unto him alone.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee what we had to ſay to you upon this advertiſement of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's. It is addreſſed to you alſo, dear Brethren, ſince you have adverſaries, who ſollicite your belief in the ſame manner as thoſe men did at firſt combat the faith of the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> They propoſe unto you the ſame errors, and paint and gild them over after the ſame method, with the vain colours of Philoſophy, with the plauſible name of Tradition, with the authority of <hi>Moſes.</hi> They are either Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines drawn forth from the ſpeculations of Philoſophers, as the invocation of Angels, and of Saints departed; the veneration of Images, the eſtate of ſouls in Purgatory and ſuch like; or humane Traditions, as prayer for the dead, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drageſimal obſervances, the Hierarchy, the Primacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> Monkery, Single-life, and others, all crected by men, without any foundation in the word of GOD. Or laſtly, they are <hi>Elements of the world,</hi> ceremonial obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, ſometime inſtituted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but aboliſhed by JESUS CHRIST, as the diſtinction of Meats, Feſtivals, Unctions, Conſecrations, Sacrifice, Fixation unto certain places; and of all that we reject in our Doctrine, there is not a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar but referrs to one of theſe three heads. Remember therefore, when they ſet upon you, that the Apoſtle ſtill to this day calls aloud from Heaven to you, <hi>Take heed that none do make booty of you by Philoſophy, and vain deception, after the tradition</hi>
                        <pb n="221" facs="tcp:50919:104"/>of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after CHRIST. Under theſe fair appearances there is hidden a pernicious deſign. Men would take you away from JESUS CHRIST, and make you a prey to, and the Vaſſals of men. Oppoſe to all their Artifices this one ſaying of the Apoſtle's, That whatever the things which are enjoined you, may be, they <hi>are not after CHRIST;</hi> they are not found in that Teſtament, wherein he hath declar'd his whole will; they have no conformity with the nature of his Goſpel, and do turn away the minds of men from that Soveraign LORD, in whom alone is our wiſdom, and our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, our ſanctification and redemption. But, Faithful Brethren, as the Apoſtle's leſſon ſhould defend you from error, ſo ſhould it preſerve you from vice. Let that JESUS, whom he ſo aſſiduouſly preacheth to you, ſill up your manners as well as your faith. Love none but him, as you believe in none but him: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the cuſtoms and vices of the world, as well as its Religion. Let the leaven of Philoſophy have no more place in your actions, than in your belief. Receive the manners of men into your communion, no more, than the traditions of men. If you be above the rudiments of the world, be alſo above its infancy, and its low and childiſh paſſions and affections; they were ſometimes pardonable in that childhood, but are inexcuſable in perſons whom JESUS CHRIST hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto perfect men, and ſuch as by his illumination he hath brought un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions noble and heavenly, and worthy of thoſe high inſtructions which JESUS CHRIST hath given you. Let your whole life be referr'd to him, paſſing by the world, and its elements; this preſent generation, and its luſts and idols, with which the LORD JESUS doth not participate in any thing. He hath cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all thoſe things for us, and diſplayed before our eyes a new world, brought forth out of the boſome of Eternity; a world incorruptible, and radiant with ſuch glory, as can neither be ſullied, or made to fade. 'Tis hither, Faithful Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that you ſhould elevate your deſires. This ſame is true Chriſtian Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, to dye with JESUS to this old world, having no more ſentiment or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for its periſhing-benefits; and to live again with the ſame JESUS in that new world whereinto he is entred for us; to breathe after nothing but its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; to think of nothing but its purity; to rejoyce in nothing but in its peace, and in the hope of its eternal pleaſures. To forgo for ever that which is paſſed; and to tend with all our might towards the mark and price of our ſupernal cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; juſtifying the verity of our Religion by the ſanctity of our converſation; ſo as there appear no more among us, either ambition, or hatred, or avarice, or any of thoſe loathſome defilements that do disfigure the whole life of worldlings. The LORD JESUS, who hath given us this excellent Divine Doctrine, who hath founded it by his death, and ſet it up by his reſurrection; who alſo hath in theſe latter times purged it afreſh both of the vanities of Philoſophy, and of the traditions of men, and of the elements of the world, pleaſe to confirm us in it for ever by his good Spirit, and to make it ſo efficacious for the ſanctification of our life, that after we have finiſhed this earthly pilgrimage, we may receive one day, at our going forth of this vale of tears, from his merciful hand, the Crown of immortality, which he hath promis'd and prepar'd for all true obſervers of his Diſcipline. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>AS the Chriſtian Religion doth conſiſt in Principles and Practiſes incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more ſublime and ſalutiferous, than any that the world ever learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Schools of Nature and the Law; ſo was it delivered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by an Author infinitely more excellent than any of thoſe were, who ever erected other Diſciplines among men. I will not inſiſt upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of thoſe various Religions which bore ſway heretofore in the time of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm; who, though they were in eſteem among Nations, and raiſed to an high reputation of wiſdom and vertue; yet had the taint of an extream ignorance and vanity; as their own Inſtitutions ſufficiently diſcover to any one that will take the pains to examine them in the light of Reaſon. It would be injurious to the LORD JESUS, the Founder and Prince of Chriſtianity, to compare him with ſuch people. But even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, the great Teacher of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and the Prophets, who commented on, explained, and confirmed his Law, are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinitely beneath the dignity of this new Law-giver. They were, I grant, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of GOD, the Mouth and Organs of his Majeſty, the Interpreters of his Will, and Heralds of his Truth; being endued (as was ſuitable to ſo high Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) with an excellent ſanctity, a rare and extraordinary Wiſdom, and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Power, which evidenced it ſelf in them by miraculous effects. But after all, they were men, and never pretended to be ranked above that feeble nature, which was common unto them and us; nor did receive any of thoſe Honours which belong to the Divine; whereas the LORD JESUS is ſo Man, as he is likewiſe GOD bleſſed for ever; and was ſo far from refuſing Divine Honours, that he hath expreſly required them at our hands; and enjoined us to adore him with the Father, and to acknowledg him his Eternal Son. This ſame difference the Apoſtle obſerves between the LORD JESUS, and thoſe other Miniſters which GOD made uſe of in the former Ages. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having at ſundry times, and in divers manners, in time paſt ſpoken unto the fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his Son.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ebr. 1.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the reſt, were Prophets of GOD; JESUS is his Son. The others were his Miniſters, JESUS is his Heir. The others were faithful as Servants;
<note place="margin">Ebr. 3.5, 6.</note> JESUS as Son is over the whole Houſe. In the others, there did ſhine forth ſome marks of the commerce they had with GOD, that Soveraign Majeſty imprinting on their faces, as upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s in particular, ſome ſparklings of his glory. But JESUS is His very Light, the reſplendency of his glory, and the character of his Perſon. Dear Brethren, it doth highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to know rightly this great dignity of our LORD and Saviour; not only for the rendring to his Perſon the worſhip we owe him, and of which we may
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50919:105"/>not fail without offending the Father, as himſelf hath told us,
<note place="margin">John 5.23.</note> 
                        <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father who hath ſent him;</hi> but alſo for our embracing with ſo much the more zeal, the Religion he hath delivered us, without ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the perſwaſion that either men on earth, or even Angels from Heaven can add any thing to the light, the goodneſs, and the perfection of the diſcipline of ſo great and ſo perfect an Author. For this cauſe doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> here hold forth to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> the Divinity of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. In the precedent Verſes he exhorted them to conſtant perſeverance in the belief of his Goſpel, confirming themſelves in it more and more, and taking heed they gave no car to Philoſophy, and the vain traditions of ſeducers, who endeavoured to corrupt ſound doctrine, by the mixing of divers inventions, which they would add to it, as if it were not perfect enough of it ſelf, to guide us to ſalvation. The Apoſtle, to bereave Error of this pretext, and ſhew the faithful, not only the ſufficiency, but even abounding of the Goſpel, repreſents unto them the ſoveraign perfection and divinity of its Author. <hi>For in him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>dwelleth all the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily.</hi> Since you have JESUS CHRIST (ſaith he), there is no need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to others. In Him, as in a living and inexhauſtible ſpring, is all good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to your happineſs; a divine Authority to found your Faith; an infinite Wiſdom to direct you in all truth; an incomprehenſible Goodneſs and Power to give you grace and glory; a quickning Spirit to ſanctifie and comfort you. All other things compared to Him, are but poverty, and weakneſs. See how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle fortifies the faithful in the doctrine of the LORD, and in few words over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws all that the preſumption of fleſh and blood may dare to ſet up, beſide, or againſt his perfect truth.</p>
                     <p>For a right underſtanding of his words, we muſt conſider them exactly. For though the number of them be ſmall, their weight is great; they are rich, and magnifick in ſenſe; and do contain, within their narrow compaſs, one of the nobleſt and fulleſt deſcriptions of JESUS CHRIST, that is found in Scripture. Let us ſee then, firſt, what all this fulneſs of the Godhead is, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. And then, in the ſecond place, how it dwells in JESUS CHRIST, to wit, <hi>bodily.</hi> The LORD pleaſe to conduct us by the light of his own Spirit, in ſo high a Meditation, that <hi>of his fulneſs we may receive grace for grace;</hi> and draw from it what may fill our ſouls with that life and ſalvation which overfloweth in him, and can be no where found at all but in him.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſubject it ſelf whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, and in which he ſaith, that <hi>all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth,</hi> none can doubt but that it is our LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST. For having ſaid, at the end of the verſe immediately foregoing, that the traditions of men, and rudiments of the world, are not after CHRIST; he now addeth, <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead.</hi> Whence it is clear, that the LORD JESUS CHRIST, whom he had even then named, is the Perſon of whom he ſpeaks, and to whom he attributes all this fulneſs. As little could any man be to ſeek, who this JESUS was, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks. All knew him, at leaſt confuſedly, and in groſs; and did conceive him a man born of <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> who having liv'd ſome years among the Jews, had been at length crucified by the ſentence of <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> and who, being riſen from the grave to a new life, had ſent forth his Apoſtles to preach his Goſpel; and afterwards af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up into Heaven. And though all did not believe that he was riſen again, and gloriſi'd; yet all well knew, that this was ſaid of him: ſo that both the one and the other hearing JESUS CHRIST named, did preſently conceive in their mind the Idea of this Perſon, born and dying in <hi>Judea,</hi> at ſuch times, and at ſuch places, with ſome retinue of Diſciples during his life, and after his death. This then is the ſubject of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, even JESUS CHRIST con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered under this form of a man, in which he manifeſted himſelf to the world, and in which he was conceiv'd and figured in the minds of thoſe that heard him named. In this man, whoſe appearance was like that of other men, who was born and bred on earth, ſuſtained during his life with our common food, ſubject to our infirmities, who paſſed through the differences of our ages, ſuffer'd our griefs, felt our inconveniences, and experimented the rigour of death, yea the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50919:106"/>cruelleſt that was; in this man, I ſay, whoſe body was nailed to a Croſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its ſoul, and buried in a Sepulcher; in this man, under ſo mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible a form, <hi>dwelleth</hi> (faith the Apoſtle) <hi>all the fulneſs of the Godhead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is ordinary in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, to ſignifie, by the fulneſs of any thing, that which the thing containeth; as, by the fulneſs of the earth, Men, and other living creatures,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 24.</note> which do fill it; and by the fulneſs of the Sea, the Iſles which the Sea containeth. After this manner of expreſſion, the qualities and perfections of any one nature may be call'd its fulneſs, becauſe they are the things that fill it, and with them it is as it were furniſhed and adorned, as the movables and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a room or an houſe, are the fulneſs of it. Therefore, as if I ſhould ſay, that in <hi>Adam,</hi> as he was at firſt created, was found all the fulneſs of Manhood, every one would eaſily perceive, that my intention were to ſay, the perfections of human nature, the faculties, and properties, and beauties, which it is full of, and without which it cannot ſuſtain the dignity of that name, were all in <hi>Adam</hi>

                        </gap>, acute ſenſes, and in ſum, all the other faculties that have any place among the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the nature of man: So here, when we hear the Apoſtle ſaying, that the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> is in JESUS CHRIST; let us account, that by this clauſe he meaneth thoſe perfections and qualities which fill up the Divine nature; in which this great and ſoveraign Beeing doth conſiſt; and which Theologues commonly call, the Attributes of GOD. You know what the word <hi>Godhead</hi> doth ſignifie, even the Nature and Eſſence of GOD. The <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> then is that rich and incomprehenſible abundance of perfections, whereof the ſupream and adorable Nature is full; as His Life, His Power, His Wiſdom, his Juſtice, His Goodneſs, His Immenſity, His Eternity, His Holineſs, and all the other Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which it hath in an ineffable manner; and which our underſtandings, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their mean capacity, do conceive in it; as the form of the Deity, that is neceſſary for its having that Name; a nature that wanteth it, being incapable of being called GOD, otherwiſe than falſly and improperly. I grant, ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, or rather ſome touches and lineaments of theſe Perfections of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head do appear in the nobleſt of the Creatures; as in the Angels, for inſtance, who are immortal, and endowed with an admirable ſanctity, vertue, and power. But the fulneſs of them is not in any Creature at all; neither can it be found, that ever the Scripture ſpake in this manner of Angels, and ſaid, that the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> was in them. Beſides, theſe bleſſed Spirits, and other Creatures, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſoever you can imagine them to be, do participate of theſe divine perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but in a very little meaſure. Whereas the LORD JESUS hath them wholly. And to make this evident to us, the Apoſtle thought it not enough to ſay, that the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> is in Him; but hath expreſly declared, that ALL this <hi>fulneſs</hi> dwelleth in Him; that we might be aſſured, there is not at all any Perfection, or Excellency, or Accompliſhment in the Divine Nature, but is found in Him. Thus, in theſe two or three words, he hath compriſed all that the Scripture teacheth us in divers places, of the richneſs of the Perfections of our LORD and Saviour. For inſtance, it tells us, That he is full of grace and truth; that he is the Wiſdom and the Power of the Father; that he hath the words of life; that he is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; that in him are hid the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom and knowledg; that he hath that might and ſtrength which ſuſtaineth all things now, and which created them at firſt; that he is the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Father, and hath immortality and incorruption; hath an infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whereby he ſoundeth the reins, and diſcerneth all the thoughts of the hearts of men; that he hath a ſuper-eminent Glory, to which all Creatures ought to do homage, yea the Angels themſelves, who indeed adore Him; the Empire, and dominion over all the world; the right and authority to judg all men, and a multitude of ſuch things as theſe. Verily S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath compriſed it all in one word, ſaying here, that all the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> is in JESUS CHRIST; it being evident, that if he wanted any of theſe Names, Rights, and Attributes, He could not have all the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead,</hi> which is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed here unto Him.</p>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:50919:106"/>
                     <p>But let us now ſee in what manner he poſſeſſeth theſe things: the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it very briefly, ſaying, that all this <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily.</hi> Firſt, the term <hi>dwelleth</hi> is illuſtrious ſignifying, that all this copious abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of perfections, doth not reſide in JESUS CHRIST for ſome time only, appearing a little while, and then withdrawing again; ſo making ſome tranſient ſtay in Him a few moments, and no more; but that it abideth in Him conſtantly, and for ever; for ſo the word <hi>[dwell</hi>] in Scripture-uſe doth import. The Word, and the glory of GOD, appeared in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, when being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the power of his Spirit, they uttered and acted Divine things; but it <hi>dwelt</hi> not in them. It only reſted on them ſome hours ſpace, for the LORD's recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending thoſe Servants of His, and for the ſetling their authority by theſe marks of his Providence, and of his communicating with them. Whereas the whole <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> was, and is, and ever ſhall be in CHRIST JESUS. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſpeaketh expreſly in the <hi>preſent tenſe,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>dwelleth in Him,</hi> not that it had dwelt in him; that no one might imagine it did at any time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. But how great and admirable ſoever the ſignification of the word <hi>[dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth]</hi> is, the Scripture yet doth frequently make uſe of it, to expreſs the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſollicitudes that the Divine Providence hath of the faithful; as when it is ſaid in ſo many places, that <hi>GOD dwelleth in the midſt of his people;</hi> and when the LORD himſelf ſaith, in reference to his Ark, whereon he ſometime manifeſted himſelf to his ancient people, <hi>I will dwell in the midſt of the children of Iſrael,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 29.45.</note> 
                        <hi>and will be their GOD.</hi> And when again, ſpeaking of <hi>Sion,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>It is my reſt for ever, there will I dwell, becauſe I have taken pleaſure therein.</hi> The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to diſtinguiſh and ſever the dwelling of the Godhead in JESUS CHRIST, from the now-mentioned, and all other kind of its dwelling otherwhere, addeth, that the fulneſs thereof dwelleth in Him bodily. He oppoſeth BODY to a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or an image; as when he ſaith afterwards, of the Ceremonies of the Law, that <hi>they were ſhadows of things to come; but the Body is in CHRIST.</hi> The BODY, that is, the Truth and thing it ſelf. The ſhadow is but a ſlight and imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of it. I think therefore that it is in this ſenſe the Apoſtle ſaith here, that <hi>the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth bodily in CHRIST;</hi> that is to ſay, really and truly; in ſubſtance, and not in ſhadow; in truth, and not in figure. The Godhead dwelt, in time paſt, in the Ark of the Covenant, but in ſhadow only. For it was not this Supream Majeſty its ſelf, that was preſent there; but a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol only, and ſome token of its glory; whereas it is the Body it ſelf (if I may ſo ſpeak) of the Divinity, and not its ſhadow only, that reſides in JESUS CHRIST; all the perfections thereof being in Him really, and in their whole truth. And hereby is excellently expreſſed to us, that admirable and ineſſable union of the Divinity, with the fleſh of our Saviour, which the Church ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily calls Perſonal; ſo cloſe an union, that this Fleſh, and the Word which aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, do make but one and the ſame Perſon; the Human nature of JESUS CHRIST ſubſiſting only in the Perſon of the Son. For if it were otherwiſe, it could not be ſaid, that the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth bodily in CHRIST. He would not have the Body of it, any more than the Creatures have, to whom it communicates its ſelf. He would have but ſome lineaments and ſhadow of it, not the very thing: For example, GOD dwelt heretofore in his Ark, inaſmuch as he manifeſted his preſence in it. But becauſe the things whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus alſo ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But beſides that theſe manifeſtations being but tranſient, it cannot, upon them, be affirmed, that GOD dwelt in the Buſh, or in the places where thoſe other Symbols appeared; beſides this, I ſay, it is evident, that the flame at the buſh was not at all the Divine Nature, or any one of its Perfections; and that neither the Dove, nor the fiery Tongues, were, any more, the proper eſſence of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50919:107"/>the Holy Ghoſt, or any one of his real and divine perfections; all theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but forms created of GOD, and conſequently Productions and Works of his, wherein he repreſented to his Servants, as in a Pourtrait, or a rough-draught, ſome ſlight reſemblance of what he is indeed. Whence it follows, that though it might be ſaid (which yet may not) of the places where theſe things appeared, That the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in them; nevertheleſs it would be falſe to ſay, that it dwelt in them bodily; it being clear, that the things by reaſon whereof it ſhould be ſaid to have dwelt there, were not the Body, and the truth of his Nature, but its ſhadow and ſymbol only. I ſay the ſame of Prophets, and of Saints, and of Angels themſelves, to whom GOD moſt intimately commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates himſelf. For the things, by reaſon whereof the Scripture ſaith, that he dwelleth in them, are that holineſs, that joy, and that knowledg, which he works and preſerves in them, in a great meaſure. Now every one ſeeth, that neither the knowledg, nor the piety, nor the charity, nor the joy, nor the conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted felicity of the Saints, are the very nature of GOD, or the Body its ſelf (if I may ſo ſpeak) of his immenſe and incomprehenſible Perfections, in which the fulneſs of his Godhead doth conſiſt: theſe things are only effects and works of GOD, engravings and impreſſions of his hand, marks of his operation; ſo as how high ſoever their excellency be, and how exact ſoever the Image of GOD in theſe Saints is; yet it cannot be ſaid, that the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth in them bodily; ſince it is clear, by the things now ſpoken, that it dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in them by ſhadows only; by the illuſtrious and glorious traces which his operation hath left in them, and not in ſubſtance. It remains then we conclude, ſince the Apoſtle here expreſly aſſerteth, that all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth bodily in CHRIST; that the Divinity is in him after a quite other manner than either in the Symbols, by which it is repreſented; or the Creatures, on which it ſheds forth its grace and glory; that it ſo dwells in JESUS CHRIST, as he hath in him, not ſome d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Now that ſuch is this divine union of the Eternal Word with the Fleſh of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, doth appear, Firſt, from that neither the Apoſtle, nor any other of the Sacred Writers, ever ſaid of Saints or Angels, what we here read of our Lord; namely, That all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth in him bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily; an evident ſign, that this is a glory which appertains to none but him alone. Secondly, From that the qualities, the actions, and the attributes of the Divinity are communicated to the Man that was born of the bleſſed Virgin; and reciprocally, the ſufferings, the qualities, and the actions of the Fleſh, that was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> are attributed to the Eternal Son of GOD; as when the Scripture ſaith, That GOD hath redeemed the Church with his own blood; that the Lord of Glory was crucified; that JESUS CHRIST is before <hi>Abraham</hi> was; that he founded the Earth at the beginning, and the Heavens are the work of his hands: and other like expreſſions. Dear Brethren, ſuch is the ſenſe of theſe divine words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. Admire ye the force and the richneſs of the Scripture, which hath in ſo few words blaſted and beaten down all the inventions and dogmatizings of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror againſt the Truth, both of the two Natures of our LORD and Saviour, and of the union of them in His Perſon.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Theſe words do overthrow the impiety of thoſe who bereave JESUS CHRIST of his Divinity, and reduce Him to the degree and condition, either of a meer Man; or of a Perſon raiſed indeed above man, yet made notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and created at the beginning, as well as other Celeſtial and Terreſtrial Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. How can ſuch blaſphemy ſubſiſt before this Sacred Oracle, which proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſimply the Divinity, but that the Godhead; and not this ſimply neither, but that the fulneſs of the Godhead; yea, to omit nothing, that all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily? If He be but a Man, and no more, no part
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50919:107"/>of this fulneſs of the Godhead dwells in Him; neither its Power, nor its Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; neither its Goodneſs, nor its Juſtice; neither its Glory, nor its Eternity. For none of theſe Divine qualities do dwell in one who is but a man. We muſt avouch, that he hath in him verily, thoſe Perfections that fill up the Godhead, (that is, the Divine Nature) or deny, that all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in him. But if you grant me (as deny it you cannot, without giving the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle the lye) that all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth in him, you muſt of neceſſity confeſs alſo, that he is GOD; no one (if he be not GOD) being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving, holding, and having in himſelf the fulneſs of GOD. For this fulneſs being infinite, there is none but GOD that can contain it, ſince there is not any but he alone who is infinite. Now it dwelleth all in our LORD JESUS CHRIST. It muſt therefore of neceſſity be confeſſed, That He is GOD of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture infinite.</p>
                     <p>Whereby the frigid and frivolous evaſions of thoſe impious men are refuted, who taking away from JESUS CHRIST the reality and true glory of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do leave him the name of it, and make a titular GOD of him; a GOD (as they ſpeak) created and raiſed up a while ſince; who hath but the title of GOD, not the nature; the office, not the eſſence. Who can ſufficiently deteſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouſneſs of theſe Wretches, that by this impiety of theirs do overthrow all the ground-work of the Scripture, which hath inſinuated nothing more clearly, or more expreſly, than the one-neſs of the true GOD? Who is too ſo jealous of his glory, as that he forbiddeth us, upon pain of death, to give his Name, or his Worſhip, or his Attributes, unto any Creature, of what quality ſoever? If JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST be not the true Eternal GOD, Creator of the Heavens, and the Earth, how will you, miſerable men, avoid this condemnation, you that give him the name, and the adoration of the true GOD? But S. <hi>Paul</hi> lays all their ſubtilty in the duſt, by ſaying formally here, that <hi>all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily.</hi> The fulneſs of the Godhead is not an empty name, or a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular dignity. It is that which fills it; it is that gloriouſneſs, it is that light, it is that nature, that truth, and that perfection, wherewith the Godhead is full. It's this therefore that dwells in JESUS CHRIST; the ſubſtance of a true and real Divinity; not an hollow, and a vain ſhadow; it's the thing, and not the title of Deity.</p>
                     <p>But as the Apoſtle doth, by theſe words, convince the impiouſneſs of ſuch as bereave our LORD and Saviour of the glory of his Divinity; ſo doth he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe confound the extravagancy of others, who deprive him of his human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, fooliſhly affirming, that he had but a falſe appearance in that kind. For here are two ſubjects clearly repreſented to us; one, that <hi>dwelleth</hi> (to wit, the fulneſs of the Godhead); another, in which this <hi>fulneſs dwelleth,</hi> to wit JESUS CHRIST; the one is, the Temple; the other is, the GOD that reſideth in the ſame: the one, our Saviours Human nature; the other, the Eternal Son of the Father. Two real and veritable ſubjects, by the wonderful uniting whereof this ſacred and adorable Sanctuary of GOD is made up and compoſed. To take away the truth, either of his Godhead, with the former; or of his Fleſh, with the latter; is to deſtroy the Fabrick. Again, theſe words of the Apoſtle do, in like manner, overthrow the error of thoſe who have corrupted the union of theſe two natures in JESUS CHRIST; on one hand by dividing them, as did the <hi>Neſtorians;</hi> on the other, by confounding them, as did the <hi>Eutycheans.</hi> For if we ſever JESUS CHRIST into two Perſons, the fulneſs of the Godhead will not dwell bodily in his Fleſh. This Man will have but gifts of the Divinity, which are as it were ſome draughts and lineaments of it; He will not have the Truth, and the very Body of it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may it be reply'd, That the Temple in which GOD reſideth, is a ſubſtance different from his Perſon. For the Body is the reſidence of the Soul; yet Soul and Body have but one and the ſame ſubſiſtence, and do conſtitute but one and the ſame Perſon. So as the dwelling of the Son in his Human nature, as in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, doth not hinder, but that this Human nature of his doth ſubſiſt with him in one and the ſame Perſon. Yet though we may not divide theſe two Natures of our LORD, it doth not follow that we muſt mix and confound them; as they do,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50919:108"/>who define the union of them, by the Human nature its being made equal with the Divine; and will have it to be become infinite, and immenſe, and endowed really in its ſelf with all the properties of the Divine nature. The Apoſtle ſaith indeed, that the fulneſs of the Godhead dwells in CHRIST; but he ſaith not, that his Fleſh was really chang'd into the Godhead. The body, by being perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally united to the ſoul, doth not thereby become ſoul. It conſerveth its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and hath only this advantage, by that ſtrict conjunction, which knits it with the ſoul, that they ſubſiſt together, and make up but one and the ſame perſon. Juſt ſo, the Fleſh of our LORD, by the Word's dwelling in it, becomes one ſelf-ſame Perſon with it, being truly the body, and the ſoul, and in one word, the nature of the Son of GOD; yet it ſtill keeps its original beeing, and eſſential properties. The LORD is a true Divinity, dwelling in a true Fleſh, and true Fleſh dwelt in by a true Divinity. There is a Divinity, and an Humanity, truly diſtinct the one of them from the other, and each of them retaining its own bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and proper qualifications; but there is one only, and the ſame Perſon, who takes His Name ſometimes from the one, and ſometimes from the other, and ſometimes jointly from them both. For we call Him the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> by reaſon of His Fleſh: The Everlaſting GOD, and the Word of the Father, and the Lord of Glory, by reaſon of His Divinity; <hi>Immanuel,</hi> (that is to ſay, GOD with us) and GOD manifeſted in Fleſh, by reaſon of theſe two natures together. I confeſs, it is a myſtery that ſurpaſſeth our comprehenſion; and a wonder, that hath no parallel. But neither muſt we meaſure the verities of Religion by the Ell of our underſtandings; eſpecially when queſtion is of GOD; whoſe Nature, Reaſon it ſelf doth confeſs to be infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible. It ſufficeth, that the word of the LORD informeth us, it is ſo. And though our reaſon cannot diſcern the manner how; yet, it being once illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Divine revelation, it acknowledgeth a kind of neceſſity of it. For preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing what the Scripture doth diſcover, and reaſon approve, of the deſert of ſin, and of the infinite puniſhment that is due to it; as alſo, of the inflexible conſtancy of Divine Juſtice, which cannot let ſin paſs unpuniſhed; it evidently follows, that man could not have been reconciled to GOD, unleſs his Juſtice were ſatisfied; nor his Juſtice have been ſatisfied, without a Sacrifice of infinite worth and merit: So as it being the office of CHRIST to reconcile men unto GOD, it is clear, that for the effecting of this great deſign, he muſt offer to the Father a Sacrifice of infinite value, and conſequently be GOD; ſince nothing can proceed from a finite ſubject but what is alſo finite; and none is infinite, but GOD alone. It was neceſſary therefore, that all the fulneſs of the Godhead ſhould dwell bodily in our Mediator. Not to ſpeak of other emoluments which this admirable union of our Nature with the Divine, in the Perſon of JESUS CHRIST, doth afford us; as, the aſſurance it gives us of the infinite love of GOD, and of our ſalvation: the title it procureth us to the merits of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whom it hath made our Brother, and conſequently our ſelves capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his co-heirs: the conſolation it ſheds into our hearts, of his, whom we ſerve, having an infinite power and wiſdom, to defend us in our combats, to ſtrengthen us in our weakneſſes, to preſerve us againſt all the aſſaults of Hell, and the World, and redeem us from death, the laſt of our enemies; it being evident, that if we had but a meer man for a Saviour, how holy and excellent ſoever he might be, there would remain unto us ſtill very great and juſt cauſes of diffidence and fear.</p>
                     <p>Therefore bleſſed for ever be the Father of our LORD; bleſſed be his love, and that great mercy which induced him to ſend us ſo excellent and admirable a Mediator, as hath all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelling in him bodily. Let us receive him with faith, and adore him with devotion, and ſerve him with zeal. Neither let his fleſh be an offence to us. It is very fleſh (I grant); but the fleſh of an Eternal GOD; who under this Pavilion of his viſible abaſement of himſelf, which the world otherwhile ſo inſolently deſpiſed, hath lodged all the glory of Heaven, and all the fulneſs of the Divinity. Nor let his Majeſty, and this fulneſs of the Godhead, which dwelleth in him, affright us. He's a great God (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs);
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50919:108"/>but a GOD manifeſted in fleſh, dwelling in our nature; deſcending, and humbled even to our degree, and partaking of our fleſh and our blood, that he might bring us to himſelf. Let us embrace with reverence that moſt ſacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which he hath brought us from Heaven. And indeed, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What penalties then muſt we expect, if we deſpiſe the Doctrine of the Son, who is eternally bleſſed with the Father?
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.3,</note> This great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as the Apoſtle elſewhere calls it) which began to be declared, firſt by the LORD? All other Diſciplines are periſhed, or will in time periſh. Even that of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s did wax old, and in the end was aboliſhed. But the Inſtitutions of CHRIST ſhall remain for ever all-holy, and all-perfect, immutable, and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable; nor do they need any reformation, or addition, or amplification. After the LORD, we do not at all look for any other new Teacher to come into the world. <hi>Moſes</hi> promis'd another Prophet after his death, to the people of GOD. JESUS CHRIST, the Prophet ſo promiſed, may have no Succeſſor. He doth not promiſe us any; but only threatens us with divers ſeducers that would uſurp His Name, and counterfeit his Voice, and put on ſheeps cloathing, to debauch his Diſciples. Whereupon we ought to take all thoſe for ſuſpicious, that pretend to add any thing whatever to his ſacred doctrine. Beſides, our LORD and Saviour's own quality doth oblige us to content our ſelves with him, and give no ear to any other. <hi>For in him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi> Seeing he hath fulneſs, the man can want nothing that poſſeſſeth him; according to what S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life;</hi> that is, eternal ſalvation, which is all that we deſire. This ſhort ſentence of the Apoſtle's is enough to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us againſt the artifices of all ſeducers: if they ſet before us the delicacies and ſubtilities of Philoſophy, colouring their fond imaginations with a vain ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of wiſdom, let us arm our ſelves with this conſideration, That we have in CHRIST JESUS all the true wiſdom that is, ſince in him dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead. If any man offer us ancient traditions, let us remember that the Authors of them were but men; who, how great and holy ſoever they may be, are all liable to error: whereas the Goſpel, which we do embrace, is his doctrine, in whom all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth bodily, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, pure and divine verity. As for thoſe Ancients, and thoſe Biſhops and Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs, whoſe names and authority you our Adverſaries do urge me with, I know not who they were; or, to ſay better, I know well that they were men ſubject to failing; ſo as neither you nor I can have any firm and certain aſſurance, that their aſſertions are true. But for this JESUS, with whoſe Goſpel I content me, we all know that he was the Son of GOD, in whom wiſdom and truth do dwell bodily, with all the fulneſs of the Deity. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf muſt be ſilent, when the LORD JESUS doth appear, as the Starrs do withdraw their light, when the Sun ſhews abroad his. The one's Law is no longer conſiderable, when the other's Goſpel is riſen.</p>
                     <p>In fine, this ſentence of the Apoſtle's doth ſuffice to overturn, not only all the traditions of men in groſs, and in general; but even each of them ſingly, and in particular. For example, we are preſs'd to ſerve and invocate Angels, and Saints departed. I will not, for the preſent, alledg, that GOD, whoſe voice is the rule of my Faith, hath given no command about it.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50919:109"/>ſerve and invocate Saints? To the end (ſay they) that we may gain their favour and their interceſſion with the Father. But, poor men, have we not, in JESUS CHRIST all the grace and favour that we need? And though there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the matter, would it not be great imprudence for us to have recourſe to others, ſince we have him near us, in whom dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Deity? They extol unto us their merits, and their ſatisfactions, and the indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Popes. I enter not upon a ſtrict examination of theſe things; nor do I make enquiry for the preſent, whether they be merits, and ſatisfactions, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, in reality or no. Though they were what thoſe men pretend they be, yet it is clear, that they are uſeleſs to us; ſince we find in this JESUS CHRIST, who ſufficeth us, all the fulneſs of the Godhead, dwelling in him even bodily. If you have need of mercy, of grace, of conſolation, of righteouſneſs, of merit, of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, of life; none of theſe good things are wanting in him, in whom dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the fulneſs of the Deity. And I am well aſſured, you ſhall find no degree of them any other where, either in Heaven or Earth. But though ſome drop of them might be elſewhere met with; yet it is certain, (and your ſelves will not deny it) that they are not to be had either in Saints, or in Angels; either ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, or ſo abundantly, as in JESUS CHRIST. Why then, while I have ſo rich a treaſure in my hands, would you have me go a begging other-where? It is ſufficient for me to be ſaved. Since the fulneſs of things neceſſary for my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dwelleth in JESUS CHRIST, I will content my ſelf with having recourſe to him alone; with ſixing my truſt, and my love on him; and with addreſſing my ſervices and ſupplications unto him: nor will I be ſo unadvis'd, as to loſe, or at leaſt hazzard my time, and my devotions, in directing them to others, which I am ſure I may ſucceſsfully apply unto him.</p>
                     <p>Dear Brethren, Let us hold to this LORD alone. Let us not divide our piety between him and any other. Let him alone have our whole hearts, and all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſince he alone hath all that fulneſs which is neceſſary to make us happy. He is the true Fountain of living water; let us not draw any other where. We have no need of Ciſterns: This Divine Rock, that followeth the Camp of his own <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> hath wherewithal to ſatisfie all his people plentifully. He wanteth nothing, who hath fulneſs. Only let us bring him ſouls hungring after his benefits, and thirſting for his righteouſneſs; hearts panting after the pleaſures of his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and braying after him, as the Hart after the brooks of water. Let us ſerve him conſtantly, and keep faithfully the holy diſcipline he hath given us, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual exerciſe of piety and charity. This is all that he demands of us, for the love he hath born us, for the favours he hath done us, and for the glory which he promiſeth us. Let us not deny him, I beſeech you, ſo juſt a thing. Let us do what he requireth us, and he will liberally give what we ask of him. He will, through his great goodneſs, communicate this Divine fulneſs to us which dwells in himſelf; that being juſtified by his merit, cleared by his light, upheld by his power, enriched by his treaſures, quickned by his ſpirit, and fed with his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; we may one day have part in his Crowns, and in his Glory, after the pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conflicts and ſlight trials of this life, to be made eternally happy in him. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.5, 6, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>that thou haſt remembrance of him; and the ſon of man, that thou viſiteſt him? For thou haſt made him little leſs than the Angels; and haſt crowned him with glory and honour. Thou haſt made him ruler over the works of thy hands.Thou haſt ſet all things under his feet.</hi> Yet it muſt be acknowledged, that all this liberality of GOD's to us-ward, which conſider'd in its ſelf is ſo great, and ſo raviſhing, is a ſmall matter in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the ineffable and incomprehenſible love which he hath ſhewed, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us his CHRIST; whether you compare the gifts themſelves, one with the other; or do conſider the fruit which they both yeeld. For the firſt; Whereas the World is a kind of Magazine of the riches of Nature; JESUS CHRIST is the Treaſury of all the Perfections of the Godhead. In the one, GOD hath ſet forth, and put together, only the works of his hand; which are effects, and as it were ſhadows of his greatneſs: in the other, he hath poured out all the abundance of his own nature; and as the Apoſtle told us in the precedent Verſe, <hi>In CHRIST dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Deity bodily:</hi> whereas in the world dwelleth only the fulneſs of the Creature. As much then as the Operator is greater than his Work, and the Creator than the Creature; ſo much more excellent and admirable is the gift that GOD hath made us of his Son, in the oeconomy of grace, than that of the World, in the adminiſtration of Nature. The difference of the fruit that we gather from the one and the other of theſe gifts of GOD, is ſuitable to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion which we ſee between the things themſelves. For firſt, the enjoying of the world could but continue life to man, who before had it; it could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to any that had loſt it: whereas JESUS CHRIST gives life to the dead,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50919:110"/>and perpetuates it to the living. Again, that life which the due uſage of the world could ſuſtain, was terrene, carnal, and obnoxious to periſhing; whereas the life we have from JESUS CHRIST, is celeſtial, ſpiritual, and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
                     <p>The holy Apoſtle, having repreſented in few words the infinite greatneſs of CHRIST in himſelf, as having all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelling in him bodily; comes now to diſcover that admirable abundance of fruit which we draw from him; the whole, as we have often told you, with an aim to confure the ingratitude and vanity of certain ſeducers, who not content with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible ſource of bleſſings, which GOD hath opened for us in his Son, would needs conjoin with it Philoſophical inventions, and legal ceremonies. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle proſecuteth this intention, down to the fifteenth Verſe; and beginning it at the Text which you have heard, he telleth the faithful <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> at firſt, that they are made compleat in JESUS CHRIST, who is the head of all principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power. Afterwards, entring upon a particular deduction of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs which we have in CHRIST, he adds, in the following verſe, <hi>That we are circumciſed in him with a circumciſion made without hand, by the putting off of the body of the ſins of the fleſh, to wit, by the circumciſion of CHRIST.</hi> Then in the ſequel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> forth other graces and benefits, which we derive from the fulneſs of our LORD. But we, for the preſent, will content our ſelves with the two verſes we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. And for the giving of you a full underſtanding of them, to your edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and conſolation, we will peruſe the two points that offer themſelves in them, the favourable aſſiſtance of GOD interpoſing.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in general, The compleatneſs which the Apoſtle ſaith we have in JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in particular, The circumciſion made without hand, which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, we have in Him.</p>
                     <p>The perfections and riches of any thing, are no advantage unto us, if they be not communicated. A Spring, how fair and freſh ſoever, does us no ſervice, if it be ſealed up; and a Garden-plot walled in, rather paineth, than pleaſeth our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; neither doth an inacceſſible Treaſure leſſen our need. The Tree of life, and the other wonders of the Paradice of <hi>Eden,</hi> did indeed enrich that delicious place; but afforded our firſt Parents no refreſhing, when entrance into them was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. For this cauſe the Apoſtle counts it not enough to have told us, that all the fulneſs of the Deity dwelleth bodily in JESUS CHRIST. Perhaps the falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers themſelves conteſted not this abundance, with him; but confeſſing, that he had all in himſelf; did only deny, that he would communicate it entirely to us, as having it only for the perfecting of his own Perſon, and not for the happineſs of ours. To baniſh this falſe conceit out of our hearts, the Apoſtle addeth, that <hi>we are made compleat in him;</hi> that is to ſay, His fulneſs is communicative; the Father hath pour'd forth into him thoſe good things and graces which fill him, that each of us might draw out as much as we need. He is the true Tree of Life, loaden with fruit, that we might gather; ſet open before our eyes, and to our hands; not ſhut up (as the other was after the fall) in a place inacceſſible. He hath receiv'd, to give unto us. He is rich, to enrich us. He is full, to repleniſh us. His abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is our bliſs; and his treaſures the relief of our neceſſity. The Father gave him unto the world; and in him, life and immortality. Neither ſuppoſe ye, that he will impart ſome of his benefits only: As he hath an all-fulneſs of them in himſelf; ſo he communicateth them all to us. He leaves no part of our nature empty. He fills up all with his graces. We derive from him all that is neceſſary to compleat us. This is that which the Apoſtle ſignifies by theſe words; and they may be taken two ways: Either as importing, that we are filled; or (as our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles have it rendred) that we are made compleat in JESUS CHRIST; but both amount to one and the ſame ſenſe, the difference being only in the manner of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and not in the thing ſignified. For the one and the other doth mean, that we receive of JESUS CHRIST our Lord, all things requiſite to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and happineſs of our perſons, the ſame reſiding moſt abundantly in him, to wit, the grace of GOD, and righteouſneſs, wiſdom, conſolation, and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50919:110"/>If you read, that we have been filled in JESUS CHRIST; it will be a ſimilitude taken from empty veſſels, which are fill'd with ſubſtances, that were extrinſique to them. For our Nature being of its ſelf empty, and deſtitute of the glory of GOD, and of its neceſſary perfections; our LORD JESUS CHRIST filleth it from his own abundance, and furniſheth it with all perfective Graces. He clothes it with his righteouſneſs, that it may appear with freedom before the Throne of the Father. He illuminates it by his Spirit unto ſaving-knowledg. He comforteth it with his peace, and decketh it with ſanctity and love, and in his treaſury on high, keepeth for it that bleſſed life and immortality, wherewith he will enrich it at the day of Reſurrection. This ſenſe (as you ſee) hath a very clear coherence with the Apoſtle's ſaying of our LORD, that <hi>in Him dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead bodily:</hi> and is exactly parallel to that of S. <hi>John</hi> in his Goſpel,
<note place="margin">John 1.16.</note> that <hi>we have all received of his fulneſs, and grace for grace.</hi> As in Nature, the Sun hath not only in its ſelf a fulneſs of that reſplendent light, which renders it ſo beautiful and ſo admirable; but diffuſeth it abroad alſo from its ſelf, and replen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſheth with it all the Luminous bodies which circulate about it, as the Moon, and the other Planets, and this Earth whereon we dwell; all which have no other brightneſs but what this great Starr doth ſhed upon them. So in Grace, (if we may take leave, to compare the myſteries thereof with natural things) JESUS CHRIST, the true Sun of righteouſneſs, hath not only in himſelf all the fulneſs of the Deity, dwelling there bodily. He alſo communicateth his fulneſs to all the ſouls of men that look on him, and do move and live in his communion. He fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them with his abundance, and clotheth them with his light, changing them into his Image; and of dim and dark lumps, as they were originally in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, making them ſo many Starrs, and lightſome bodies.</p>
                     <p>Now if you take the Apoſtle's word here, in another manner, as importing, that we have been made compleat in JESUS CHRIST; the ſenſe will ſtill be very pertinent. For beſides, that we being naked of all perfections meet for our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſaying, that we have been made compleat in CHRIST, will excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well expreſs his Grace, as ſignifying, that it is he who hath fill'd up our brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and repaired in us what the other <hi>Adam</hi> had ruined, by giving us all that we wanted: Beſides this, I ſay, this term will alſo very aptly anſwer to that title which the Apoſtle gave, a little before, to the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law; where he called them <hi>the rudiments of the world;</hi> that is, the beginnings, the firſt and plaineſt Leſſons of Piety;
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.19. Gal. 4.</note> ſuch as conſequently were unable to bring to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he ſaith expreſly in another place; by reaſon whereof he ſtileth the time of the Law, the infancy of the Church; that is, the age of its imperfection. Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing therefore JESUS CHRIST unto the Law in this reſpect, he now ſaith, that we are compleat in Him, and that for good reaſon; in as much as He hath the body, whereas the Law had but the ſhadow; He hath fulneſs, whereas the Law had but ſome ſmall parcel of the requiſites of our ſalvation. For the ſame cauſe, he elſewhere calleth the Ceremonies of it weak, and poor, or beggarly elements.
<note place="margin">Gal. 4, 9.</note> As for the Law (ſaith he) it did but begin with us, and only draw ſome ſlight and dark lineament upon us, of that true form which GOD did purpoſe to imprint; whereas JESUS CHRIST hath finiſh'd us. In Him it is we have that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that entire body, that truth and fulneſs, whereof the Law had but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the ſhadow, and figure.</p>
                     <p>Hereby now this holy man deals thoſe ſeducers, whom he hath undertaken, an handſom blow, diſcovering the fooliſhneſs of their deſign, who would ſtill oblige perſons to the Ceremonies of the Law, that were made compleat in JESUS CHRIST; an attempt no leſs ridiculous, than if one ſhould put a man to his ABC again, who had received the laſt tincture of higheſt erudition in the Univerſity; pretending, that he could not be throughly intelligent, and accompliſh'd, except he ſtill daily ſtudied the rudiments and plaineſt leſſons of Children. But that which follows in the Apoſtle's words, namely, that JESUS CHRIST is the Head of all principality and power; is adjoined to prevent another error of thoſe men's, who (as we ſhall hereafter hear) did teach the worſhipping and ſerving of Angels; pretending it neceſſary we ſhould addreſs our ſelves to them, as to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50919:111"/>capable of interceding with GOD for us, and of obtaining by their interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal with that Supreameſt Majeſty, thoſe graces and perfections which we need. S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſhew, in theſe few words, the vanity of this falſe doctrine. For ſince the LORD JESUS is the Head of Angels, who ſees not but that we have moſt abundantly in Him, whatſoever theſe people could expect from them? and that poſſeſſing JESUS CHRIST, as we do by faith in His Goſpel, we have no need to run to Angels, who depend upon Him, and have nought but what is found much more richly in their Head? As if a man that doth poſſeſs a Prince's Son, would yet needs make uſe of the favour and interpoſitions of his ſervants with him. Members have neither motion, nor ſenſation, nor life, but the ſame is much more abundantly in their Head. Subjects and Servants poſſeſs nothing, but the Prince can far better, and far more eaſily communicate it to us, than any one of them. Since JESUS CHRIST is the Head and Prince of Angels, it is clear, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Him, we want nothing of all that which the Angels can give us. From the ſame ground appeareth further, the impiety of the error of theſe Seducers. For ſince the Angels are ſubject unto JESUS CHRIST, it is evident by the light of Scripture, that no one can give them that religious worſhip which theſe people attribute to them, without becoming guilty of idolatry; the greateſt and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt outrage that man can do to his Creator. For no Chriſtian can be ignorant, but that GOD throughout his whole word doth forbid us to ſerve any creature, how high and excellent ſoever it be; religious worſhip being an homage which belongs to the Divine Nature, and cannot be performed, without ſacriledg, to any other. As for other things, I preſume you all know that they are the Angels whom the Apoſtle means, by theſe principalities and powers of which he ſpeaks, as we formerly explained it,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.16.</note> upon the precedent Chapter. He ſaith, that JESUS CHRIST is their Head, that is, their Lord. And this quality belongeth to Him, not only as He is the Eternal Son of the Father, of the ſame eſſence and power with Him; who having created them at the beginning, and continuing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them by His Goodneſs and Might, is by all kind of right their true Maſter, and natural Lord; but alſo as He is the CHRIST and Mediator. For ſince He, in this relation, and under this quality, hath been conſtituted the Lord of all things, both ſuperior,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.10.</note> inferior, and intermediate; having, in conſequence of His humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, receiv'd ſuch a Name, as is above every name, and unto which every knee boweth, both of thoſe that are in Heaven, and that are on Earth, and that are under the Earth; it is evident, that in this ſenſe He hath dominion and empire over Angels,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.22.</note> as well as others. And thus alſo S. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly teacheth us, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Angels, and Authorities, and Powers, have been made ſubject to Him: For this cauſe, theſe Spirits are often called, the Angels of CHRIST, as in S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 13.41. &amp; 24.31. Rev. 1.1. and 22.16.</note> 
                        <hi>The Son of Man ſhall ſend his Angels:</hi> and in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> where S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that JESUS CHRIST ſent him by his Angel, the things that were reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him; and in the ſame Book, <hi>I JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> (ſaith the LORD) <hi>have ſent mine Angel.</hi> Only we muſt obſerve, that the L. JESUS is not called Head of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in the ſame manner and ſenſe as He is ſtiled Head of His Church. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Title ſignifieth only the Empire and Lordſhip which he hath over the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. The ſecond ſignifieth further the union He hath with His faithful ones, who were ſaved and redeemed by the merit of His Death, and are animated and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit of His Reſurrection. For He doth indeed command the Angels, as their true and legitimate Maſter; but He hath not aſſumed them, nor waſh'd them from their ſins; theſe holy and bleſſed Natures having never committed any: Nor hath He, by His merit, obtain'd for them, that life and bliſs which they enjoy; theſe all being benefits pertaining unto none but men. Accordingly you ſhall not find, that the Angels are called His Body, or His Members. This qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is peculiar to the faithful, conſonantly to what the Apoſtle elſewhere ſaith, to wit,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.23.</note> that CHRIST is the Saviour of His Body; and every one knows, that He is not the Saviour of Angels; ſince they, having not fallen from their original purity and felicity, have had no need of being ſaved.</p>
                     <p>But come we now to the ſecond point of our Text, which the Apoſtle layeth before us in theſe words: <hi>In whom alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you are circumciſed,</hi> &amp;c. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50919:111"/>here to diſcover in particular, and by as retail, what he but now ſpake of in general; namely, our having been made compleat in JESUS CHRIST; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying, one by one, the perfections which thoſe falſe Teachers ſought for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where than in JESUS CHRIST; and ſhewing, that they are to be ſound plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in him, ſo as there is no need to have recourſe to any beſides him, or to add any thing to his Goſpel, for the acquiring of them. Among all thoſe things that theſe Seducers ſought to ſhuffle into Religion, there was none they preſſed more than Circumciſion, which (as you know) was one of the Sacraments of the old Covenant, wherein, by cutting off the fore-skin, was figured and exhibited to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the purifying of their nature by the aboliſhing of their, ſins and exciſion of their vices, as alſo, their entrance into the communion of GOD. In effect, this Ceremony was of infinite importance. For it was the ſeal of all the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; the perſon, who receiv'd it, being by means of it conſecrated and initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Diſcipline of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſolemnly obliged to obſerve the ſame, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle remonſtrates to the <hi>Galatians.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 5.3.</note> 
                        <hi>I proteſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to every man who is circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he is bound to fulfil the whole Law.</hi> For this cauſe he begins with it in this place, well knowing of what conſequence this error was, which annihilated the Croſs of CHRIST, and overthrew the whole myſtery of his Grace. Let none ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (ſaith he) againſt this compleatneſs which you have in JESUS CHRIST, that having not been circumciſed, you want the firſt and the principal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Whence you ſee, to how little purpoſe theſe men endeavour to make you ſubject to this ancient inciſion of the Law; it being altogether ſuperfluous to ſuch as have paſs'd through the hands of JESUS CHRIST. The Apoſtle ſets this conſideration before the <hi>Philippians,</hi> in a diſpute of his againſt the ſame ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are the Circumciſion, who worſhip GOD in the ſpirit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3.3.</note> 
                        <hi>and glory in CHRIST JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> But here he explaineth, in what follows, this admirable circumciſion which we have received in JESUS CHRIST; and ſaith, firſt, that it is not made with hands: next, he adds in what it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; to wit, in putting off the body of ſins: and laſtly, he termeth it, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of CHRIST. He ſaith then firſt, that this circumciſion which we have in our LORD and Saviour, is not made with hand, whereby he affirmeth, that it is not formally and preciſely that circumciſion which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave the <hi>Jews,</hi> the hand of man effecting that in their fleſh. This here, is made by the operation, not of a man, but of GOD; with the knife, not of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of CHRIST; that is, by that word of his, accompanied by his Spirit,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> which is ſharper than any two-edged ſword. In which reſpect alone, it hath a great advantage above the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the <hi>Jews;</hi> it being evident, that the works of GOD are more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beyond compare, than the works of men. And as the Apoſtle, telling us in another place, that the building which we look for,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.1.</note> after the diſſolution of this earthly tabernacle, is not made with hand, doth by that very reaſon demonſtrate the excellency of it, even that it is a work not of human art, or nature; but of the wiſdom and power of GOD: In like manner he here diſcovereth the worth and value of our circumciſion in JESUS CHRIST, by ſaying that it is not made with hand.</p>
                     <p>But the thing it ſelf doth no leſs demonſtrate the ſame, than the quality of that operation by which we receive it. For this circumciſion made without hand, which we have in JESUS CHRIST, is (as the Apoſtle here defines it) the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of the body of the ſins of the fleſh. You know what he and the other holy Writers do underſtand by the fleſh; to wit, this not only infirm and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, but moreover defiled and corrupted nature, which we all bring into the world; comprehending not only the body and the ſenſes, but alſo the ſoul, and it tainted and infected with the ordures of ſin, and in ſome ſort transformed into fleſh by the carnal qualities and habitudes wherewith it is inveſted; its underſtanding
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50919:112"/>being wholly dull and ſenſual, its will earthly and brutiſh, and its affections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious againſt the Law of Heaven, and all of them ſet on the fleſh. This nature of man thus framed, is that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> both here, and frequently elſewhere, calleth fleſh. The ſins of this fleſh are the habits of thoſe divers vices that cover it, and invelop it on all hands; not thoſe only that properly relate to the body, and the ſatiating of its irregular appetites, ſuch as are they that refer either to gluttony and drunkenneſs, or to luxury; but alſo all others whatſoever, which croſs the Law of GOD, and overthrow that order of righteouſneſs and holineſs which he appointed for all the faculties, and motions, and ſentiments of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.19, 20.</note> as we are taught by the Apoſtle in many places, and particularly in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he placeth, among the works of the fleſh, not only adultery, and fornication, and drunkenneſs; but alſo idolatry, and hereſie, and enmity, and clamours, and envyings, and wrath, and murthers, and ſuch like. The maſs of all theſe vices is that which he here calleth the body of the ſins of the fleſh;
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> and he uſeth this manner of ſpeaking again elſewhere, as when he ſaith, that the body of ſin is deſtroyed, our old man having been crucified with the LORD. And it muſt be confeſs'd, that this figure is marvellouſly elegant, and proper for this matter. For even as the body comprehendeth in its ſelf ſeveral members, which have each of them their particular function and exerciſe; in like manner this maſs of corruption which we bear about in our nature, is compoſed of many different Vices, which have each of them their peculiar motion and operation. Ambition tendeth one way, Avarice and Intemperance another. Envy defileth us in one manner, Cruelty in another, and each of theſe peſts hath its own ſentiment and ends. Their motions are ſometimes even contrary, and do thwart one another, as unclean ſpirits that are not at an agreement. However, at the bottom, all theſe evils come from one and the ſame ſource, and live in one and the ſame maſs; as all the members do make up but one and the ſame body. Hence it is, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſometimes, conſidering ſins under this notion, calleth them our members, or the members of our fleſh;
<note place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note> as when he commands us to mortifie our members, which are upon the earth, to wit, fornication, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, and other like Vices. Moreover, as this body, in which we live, doth cover us all about; ſo that maſs of Vices, wherewith our nature is infected, doth encompaſs and on wrap us on all ſides; there being no part or faculty in us, but is as it were inveſted and beſieged with it. Such is the corruption that we derive from the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> and by reaſon thereof, the Apoſtle ſometimes alſo calleth it, the old man: He ſaith therefore, that the circumciſion which we have in JESUS CHRIST, is the putting off of this body of the ſins of the fleſh; when the faithful perſon, by the virtue of the Word and Spirit of the LORD JESUS, doth cut off all the vices of the fleſh, which are the members thereof, and ſtrips himſelf of this old habit of ſin and death, wherewith the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> clothed us. This is that which in the ſame ſenſe he elſewhere calleth a putting off the old man as to former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.22. Col. 3.8. Gal. 5.24.</note> which is corrupted by deceitful luſts. And in this preſent Epiſtle, a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of anger, malignity, and evil ſpeaking, and other ſuch ſins; and again in another place, a crucifying of the fleſh, with its affections and luſts. All this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to the ſame ſenſe, and ſignifieth the mortifying of the fleſh, and the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of its Vices, that there may be an abſtaining from all the ſins which they are wont to produce in the lives of men of the world. The Apoſtle adds, in the end, that this is the circumciſion of CHRIST. Firſt, becauſe our LORD and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath expreſly inſtituted it in his Goſpel, commanding us to be born again, to deny our ſelves, to change our deportments, to put on a ſimplicity and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, like that of little children; and to break all the ties we have with the fleſh and the world, if we will follow him, and have part in his Kingdom. This is the firſt and moſt important inſtruction in his Diſcipline. Secondly, It is the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of CHRIST, becauſe it's he alone who is the Author of it, and doth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it in us; neither is there ought, but his Goſpel alone, that can unclothe man of this body of the ſins of the fleſh. For it is not poſſible, but that a ſoul on whom the Doctrine of JESUS CHRIST hath been imprinted, by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhould renounce the world and the fleſh. Philoſophy was ſo far
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50919:112"/>from curing this malady, that it did not ſo much as know it ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ctly. The Law diſcovered it indeed, and made man to feel the tyrannous ſtrength of this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious body of the fleſh, wherewith he is naturally clothed and ſurrounded. But it was unable to ſubdue and mortifie it, as the Apoſtle teacheth us at large in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> There is none but JESUS CHRIST, who by the efficacy of his heavenly truths, and the divine examples of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thruſt down into our hearts by the hand of his Spirit, can circumciſe us in this manner, unfolding and diſ-inveſting us by little and little of theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bonds, and weakning and extinguiſhing the life of the fleſh in us. Compare now this Circumciſion of our Saviour's, with that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and you will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty, perceive, that it infinitely ſurpaſſeth it in dignity and excellency. That of <hi>Moſes</hi> wounded the body; this of CHRIST enliveneth the ſoul. The one par'd away a little skin, the other mortifies the whole body of the fleſh. The one was, in its ſelf, but a typical ceremony; the other is a myſtical verity. The one mark'd the fleſh; the other maketh better, and ennobleth the heart. Without the one a man could have no part in the communion of the carnal <hi>Jews;</hi> and by the other we enter into the alliance of the ſpiritual <hi>Jews,</hi> whole praiſe is of GOD and not of men. Whereby you may judg how extravagant the conceit of thoſe ſeducers was, whom the Apoſtle doth in this place oppoſe; who notwithſtanding that excellent and divine circumciſion which Chriſtians have receiv'd in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's School, would yet bring them under that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was poor and weak, and ſo many ways defective, as if Chriſtians could not, upon a far better ground than the <hi>Jews,</hi> glory, that they truly are GOD's circumciſed. Now for a right comprehending of the force of the Apoſtle's reaſoning, it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that circumciſion, as well as the other ceremonies of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, was a figure, which repreſented the abſciſſion of the vices and luſts of the fleſh, as the Prophets themſelves do clearly enough ſhew, when they promiſe the ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that GOD will circumciſe their heart, and the heart of their ſeed,
<note place="margin">Deut. 30.6, Jer. 4.4.</note> that they may love him, and live; and command them to circumciſe themſelves unto the LORD, and to take away the fore-skin of their hearts; an evident ſign, that this external action did refer to the internal mortification, and ſanctification of the ſoul. Since then the figure is unprofitable, when the truth is attained; and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels do ſerve only till the things themſelves be formed and perfected; the uſe of them, when this is done, being no longer neceſſary: you plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y ſee, that from the Apoſtle's ſaying here, that in JESUS CHRIST we have this putting off, or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of the ſins of the fleſh (that is, the truth, whereof circumciſion was the figure and model); it evidently follows, that it is no longer neceſſary for us, and that a wilful retaining of it ſtill, is an accuſing of JESUS CHRIST of having not fulfilled in his Diſcipline the thing repreſented by this ancient type. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'s true, that even in the time of the Old Teſtament the faithful had ſome part of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification ſignifi'd by their circumciſion; but what they had was weak, and in ſmall meaſure; becauſe the true cauſes on which it dependeth, being all compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Myſteries of the New Teſtament, were then but fore-told and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not fully and clearly revealed, as now by their accompliſhment they have been; by means whereof it was meet, that during all that time they ſhould be exercis'd in the obſerving of theſe typical rites, and held in, and kept under the Pedagogie of <hi>Moſes,</hi> until the fulneſs of time, according to the Apoſtle's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> Now that JESUS CHRIST hath openly exhibited the very body of truth, and fully brought to light all the cauſes and motives of true ſanctification, theſe exerciſes of the Church's infancy are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſeaſonable; and they that ſtill ſtick to them, are no leſs ridiculous than he that would ſtill keep up the centries of a vault, or the models of a building, even after the Fabrick is finiſh'd, and brought to its perfection; or retain under a School-maſter's Ferule, and in the reſtraints of childhood, a man grown up, and come to ripeneſs of years.</p>
                     <p>This is that we had to ſay for the expoſition of this Text. It remaineth for a concluſion, that we extract thoſe inſtructions and conſolations, which if we me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on it attentively, it will afford us.</p>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:50919:113"/>
                     <p>Firſt, Since the Apoſtle aſſureth us, that we are compleat in CHRIST, you ſee how vain thoſe mens pretenſions are, who ſet forth certain rules of perfection, as they call them, beyond the Goſpel. Let us content our ſelves with our LORD's fulneſs, and ſeek our perfection in him alone. And inſtead of amuſing our ſelves about the inventions of men, embrace and practiſe CHRIST's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, advancing daily towards the utmoſt degree of perfectneſs. For we may not flatter our ſelves with an imagination, that a man may nevertheleſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to him, though he lead an wholly vicious and corrupt life. S. <hi>Paul</hi> here proteſteth plainly to us, that all ſuch as are in him, are made compleat. Whence it neceſſarily follows, that ſuch as are not compleat, are without his communion, and by conſequence ſhould not promiſe themſelves any ſhare in his ſalvation; it being prepared for thoſe only that are in him. If this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine do trouble us, let us impute it to our vices and our looſneſs; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king once this truth to heart, with all our might endeavour after that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which is in JESUS CHRIST; accounting, that without it we cannot poſſeſs either his grace in this world, or his glory in the world to come. I well know, that to ſpeak abſolutely, no one is perfect; and that if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our condition on earth, with that in heaven, all our perfections are but weakneſſes. Yet it is true, that JESUS CHRIST doth, even in this life, in ſome ſenſe, compleat his faithful ones; and this perfection, which he giveth them, is not a vain name or an imagination. It's a thing, and a moſt real truth; it is a piety and charity, ſincere, and free, and without hypocriſie; which, though it ſometimes fail, doth notwithſtanding produce true fruits, and works quite different from thoſe of Worldlings and Hypocrites, according to what our LORD ſaid, even that <hi>if your righteouſneſs do not exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, you ſhall in no wiſe enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Object not, that you are yet on earth, and that perfection is not to be found but in heaven; and that to live as an Angel, one ſhould be without a body. It is not the perfection of Heaven that we demand of you. The LORD will not reject you for having not had in this life the tranſcendent brightneſs of the next. But though a child be not obliged to conduct his life with as much prudence and reaſon as a man of years; it doth not follow, that he hath licence to live without rule, and in the debanches and diſorders of ſlaves. Every Age hath its bounds, and its meaſures, and its perfection. Our childhood here below muſt not be without diſcipline, under the pretence, that it is not come to full growth. Chriſtians, I complain not, that there are defects in your knowledg, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which have no place in Heaven; but that there are in you vices which ought to have no place on earth. I blame you, not for that there is a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between you and Angels; but that there is none between you and worldly men. I require, not what is above the ſtrength of your age, but what is worthy of your profeſſion, and doth not at all exceed your light. I beſeech you only to labour as much for JESUS CHRIST, as the children of this generation do for the intereſts of their luſts. This doth not exceed the capacity of our nature, ſince you ſee what the ſervants of ſin do: and its neceſſarily your duty; except you imagine, that we owe leſs to JESUS CHRIST, than Worldlings do to their fooliſh and vain paſſions.</p>
                     <p>The firſt piece of that compleatneſs which we have in him, is this Divine Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which is not made with hand, but by the efficacy of his Spirit. Without it, we can have neither place in the communion of his people, nor right to his Inheritance. It's a Circumciſion, of which we may truly ſay, that every ſoul that ſhall not have receiv'd it, ſhall be cut off from his people. The Apoſtle ſhews us wherein it conſiſts, to wit, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh. JESUS CHRIST hath put the ſword in our hand, that's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to cut away this wretched fleſh, namely, his ſacred word, wherein he diſcovers the horridneſs of ſin, and infernal venom of vices, and the vanity and iniquity of all the luſts of the fleſh. He hath ſhew'd us the perdition which they that ſerve it fall into; and hath put it to death on his Croſs, and buried it in his Sepulcher. He hath ſpread before our eyes the wonders of GOD's love,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50919:113"/>and the eternity of the Kingdom appointed for faithful ſervants. He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us rules and examples of this part of our ſanctification, in his Goſpel, and in his life; and offereth us the lights and conſolations of his Spirit, to lead us in this work. Graſp we then this Divine Knife of his Goſpel. Thruſt it hardily in to our hearts, and cut out thence all the impurity of the vices that are there. Let us rid our ſelves of them, and caſt them behind us. Exterminate all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the fleſh, as execrable things. Leave not one of them in our ſelves. Having ſubdued Avarice, combat Ambition. Pluck out Luxury and all its paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from our inward parts. Root up Hatred, and Wrath, and Cruelty, and ſpare the life of none of theſe Monſters. Let us not reſt, until we have clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our hearts of all this curſed brood. For it is not enough to have cut off ſome of them. One ſole Enemy abiding in our boſome, is able to deſtroy us. The body of the ſins of the fleſh muſt be put off, ſaith the Apoſtle, and not one or two of its ſins only. I confeſs, the labour is hard; but it is neceſſary, and that at all times (for it is the task of our whole life); in eſpecial manner at preſent, now that the death of our LORD and Saviour, and his reſurrection, and his holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, do call us to extraordinary efforts of piety and ſanctity. And if the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be great, the felicity and the glory that follows it, is infinite. Let us employ our ſelves in it, well-beloved Brethren, with ardency and generoſity, put off the body of all our ſins; that having truly crucified our old man with the LORD JESUS, we may alſo riſe again with Him, to be enliven'd by his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial food, and have part for ever, after the ſhort trials of this life, in His bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed immortality. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>DEar Brethren, It is very true, that the ſolemnity of this great day, which hath been conſecrated by all Chriſtians to the reſurrection of the LORD JESUS, and ſanctifi'd by the Myſteries of his Table, at which we have communicated, doth require more than ordinary devotion and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of us: Yet I have not needed to ſeek a ſubject for the preſent exerciſe, any other where than in the ſeries of the ordinary Texts which I do, in this place, expound to you; the words I have read, which immediately ſucceed thoſe you heard laſt LORD's Day, excellently ſuiting each of thoſe duties to which this day is particularly dedicated: For they treat of our LORD's reſurrection, and of the fruits that redound to us thereby; as alſo of Baptiſm, wherein they are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to us, and which was wont, for this reaſon, to be ſolemnly adminiſtred heretofore in the ancient Church, on the night before <hi>Eaſter;</hi> and of that faith, by which we become poſſeſs'd of this Divine Reſurgent. Laſtly, They ſpeak of the intereſt we have in his burial, that ſequel of his precious death, the bleſſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration whereof we have celebrated this morning. Subjects theſe, which are, as is plain to all, eminently meet for the devotion of this day. This then ſhall be, by the will of GOD, the matter of this action. Faithful Souls, afford it a vigorous and a deep attention, elevating your thoughts to JESUS CHRIST, the Prince of our ſalvation, and Author of our immortality, whiles we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to repreſent to you what his Apoſtle here teacheth us about our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in his burial and reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>You may remember, that to confound the impiety of certain Seducers, who would oblige Chriſtians to <hi>Moſaical</hi> Circumciſion, this holy man alledg'd, in the precedent Text, that we have in JESUS CHRIST that ſubſtance and truth whereof the <hi>Judaical</hi> Circumciſion was but the ſhadow and model; having in him put off the body of the ſins of the fleſh; ſo as having receiv'd, through the grace of JESUS, this myſtical and divine circumciſion, the other carnal and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical one is altogether uſeleſs to us, and cannot be deſired or practis'd by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, without wronging their Saviour. He ſtill proſecutes that ſame intention; and to ſhew how rich that ſanctifying-grace is, which we have in JESUS CHRIST, he adds, that beſides our being circumciſed by the virtue of his word, and diveſted of the body of the ſins of the fleſh; we have moreover been buried with him through Baptiſm; and further, that we are therein riſen again with him, through the faith of the efficiency of GOD, who raiſed him from the dead:</p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:50919:114"/>
                     <p>For a right underſtanding of theſe words, we are to conſider, Firſt, The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion we have both in the burial and reſurrection of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. And ſecondly, The twofold means by which this communion is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, to wit, Baptiſm, and the Faith of the efficiency of GOD, who hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our LORD from the dead. The Apoſtle expreſſeth the firſt point in theſe words, <hi>Being buried with him, in which alſo you are riſen again together.</hi> As for our burial with the LORD, you know, that having ſuffer'd on the Croſs that dolorous and accurſed death which we had merited; his ſacred body, looſned from that mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tree, and wrap'd up in a ſheet, was by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> laid in a new Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, where it remained three days without motion, without reſpiration, and without life, in this ſad ſtate, (the laſt of our infirmities) until the beginning of the third day, when he gloriouſly roſe again. The tranſcendent wiſdom of the Father, which ordered all the parts of this great work, proceeded thus here very fitly, to juſtifie the truth of his Son's death, by his ſtay in the grave. For if he had reſum'd his life immediately after he laid it down, and deſcended from the Croſs alive again, I confeſs ſuch a Miracle might have aſtoniſh'd and tranſported the minds of the Spectators, and demonſtrated, that this Divine crucified Perſon was more than man. But on the other hand, it would have rendred his death ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious, and without doubt made men imagine, that it had been but a feigned and falſe appearance, and no real ſeparation of his ſoul from his body; which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion would evidently have ſhaken and overthrown our ſalvation, it being entirely founded on the death of the LORD JESUS. Whereas therefore it ſo highly concerns us to believe the ſame, GOD hath in ſuch ſort aſſured and certifi'd the truth, that we have not any ſhew of reaſon to call it in queſtion. For this cauſe, it was his will, that the LORD JESUS, having commended his ſpirit into his hands, ſhould be laid in the Sepulcher, and continue there three days; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, after this, no more cauſe to doubt, but that he was truly dead, ſince he was ſo long a time in the ſtate of the dead. Moreover our conſolation required, that he ſhould enter into our Sepulchers, to take away for us the horror of them, and to aſſure us by His example, that they have not force enough to detain our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for ever, or to hinder them from riſing one day again. It's for theſe reaſons, and other ſuch, that JESUS CHRIST would go down into this, death's laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment. The Apoſtle ſaith then, that true believers have been buried with him.</p>
                     <p>How ſo (you will ſay), ſeeing that they, being living perſons, were never laid in the grave; and ſurely not in our LORD's, that was ſituate on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> nigh to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> places very far diſtant from our abode?</p>
                     <p>Dear Brethren, there is no man ſo groſs, but doth plainly ſee, that theſe words are not to be taken according to the letter, but figuratively; and that they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie not a natural but a myſtical Sepulcher. And in ſuch a ſenſe it may be ſaid two manner of ways; That we have been buried in CHRIST, or with CHRIST. Firſt, in regard of our juſtification, that is, the remiſſion of our ſins. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in regard of our ſanctification, and the mortifying of the old man. For as concerning the firſt, it is evident that JESUS CHRIST was not buried, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he crucified and put to death, but for us only. Burial is nothing elſe but a conſequent of death. It's the ſad and diſmal ſtate to which it reduceth men ever ſince they became guilty; that is to ſay, it makes up a part of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin. As indeed it's a hideous thing, and full of horror, to ſee ſo noble and excellent a Creature, in whom the Image of GOD did ſhine forth, and who had been formed for immortal glory, to be brought down to the grave, under the power of Worms and putrefaction. JESUS CHRIST therefore having undergone this ignominious Infirmity for us, and for our Salvation, that he might leave none of our penalties unſatisfied for, it's evident that when he was buried, we were buried in him, and with him; ſince it was properly for us, that he did deſcend into the Sepulcher. He bore us upon the Croſs. He bore us in the grave. We all were in him, foraſmuch as he, in all this work, acted but for us. We did and ſuffered theſe things, ſince we are the cauſe that he did and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. We were buried in him, foraſmuch as His being buried hath diſcharged
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50919:115"/>this part of our puniſhment, and ſo changed the nature of our graves, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being priſons, and places of execution, they are now ſo many beds and dormitories, wherein our bodies do repoſe until the reſurrection. Thus his burial hath freed ours from the curſe, which is naturally upon it; and this benefit makes up a part of that juſtification which he hath merited for us, it comprehending an exemption from all the penalties that are due to our ſins.</p>
                     <p>But it is not in this ſenſe that the Apoſtle ſaith we have been buried with JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST. For he ſpeaks here of the firſt part of our ſanctification, which is nothing elſe but the mortifying of the body of ſin, or old man in us, and its bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, that is, the bringing it to nought. It's therefore properly in this reſpect <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſays, that we have been buried with JESUS CHRIST, even in as much as by the virtue of his death and burial, our old man hath been deſtroy'd, and ſuffer'd a death and burial ſemblable and analogical to JESUS CHRIST's. For as his fleſh, after it was depriv'd of life, was laid in a grave; in like manner the old man of true believers, having been ſtain, is interred and brought to nought. And as the LORD JESUS left in the Sepulcher his Funeral linnen clothes, together with all the infirmity and mortality he had, and came forth veſted with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and a life fully refined from all that weakneſs of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in him during the days of his fleſh; even ſo the faithful do put off for ever that body of ſin wherewith their firſt Parent had enwrapped them, and leave it in their myſtical Sepulcher, to be reſum'd no more; but that they may hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth lead a life free, and exempt from all its filthineſs and turpitude. Laſtly, As the burial of our Saviour was properly but a progreſſion and continuation of his death; ſo likewiſe that of our old man is but a proſecuting of his deſtruction; 'tis the eſtate this puts him in, and under it he abides for ever, without riſing any more. S. <hi>Paul</hi> does elſe where clearly ſhew us, that it is thus we muſt underſtand his words; as when he ſaith, in the ſixth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>we are buried with CHRIST by baptiſm into his death,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6.4, 5.</note> 
                        <hi>that as he was raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father; ſo we ſhould likewiſe walk in newneſs of life:</hi> and immediately after he ſaith, that <hi>we have been made one ſelf-ſame plant with him, by the conformity of his death and reſurrection.</hi> To which muſt be alſo added, that it is in him, and with him, we have been buried in this ſort; for that in his death and burial the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and cauſes of ours were contained. His death hath deſtroyed our old man, and his burial hath interred him; it being evident, that if our LORD had not ſuffered both the one and the other for our ſalvation, ſin would ſtill live and reign in us. For it is the love of GOD, and his peace, and the hope of glory, the true effect of our Saviour's death and burial, that gives the deaths-wound to our old man, and that doth aboliſh and bury his whole life.</p>
                     <p>See then how we are buried with him; not that, to ſpeak properly, our bodies do really enter into the grave, in <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi>'s garden, where his abode three days (away with ſo childiſh a conceit): but for that the virtue of his death and holy Sepulcher doth derive into us an image and a copy of his burial, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and burying our old man by his efficacy, and bringing on him a myſtical death and burial conform to his own real and myſtical one. This now, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle addeth, <hi>that we are alſo riſen again, together with him;</hi> muſt alſo be underſtood after the ſame manner. As our death and burial with him is myſtical and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, ſo is likewiſe our reſurrection; theſe words ſignifying no other thing, but that he, by the virtue of his reſurrection, doth work and produce one in us, which hath reſemblance and analogy with his own. And this reſurrection of the faithful, in conſequence, and by the efficacy of JESUS CHRIST's, is their being renewed unto an holy, ſpiritual, and Evangelical life. For even as the LORD, having put off on the Croſs, and left in the grave, that earthy, infirm, and natural life which he had led here below, during the days of his fleſh; did put on a new one, that was glorious, ſpiritual, and immortal, riſing from the grave a man heavenly, and living to eternity by the ſole ſtrength of a quickning ſpirit; ſo likewiſe all his true members having quitted their old man, as deſtroyed and aboliſhed by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his death, do put on the new, which is formed in righteouſneſs and holineſs; and inſtead of that vile and wretched life which they led aforetime in the turpitude
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50919:115"/>and fifth of ſin, they take up another wholly new one, which is quickned by the Spirit from on high, upheld by his power, and ſhineth all over with the glorious lights of his ſanctity, charity, and purity. But beſides this conform <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

His reſurrection is the cauſe of ours; without it we ſhould lye dead ſtill, and in bondage to ſin. This will appear, if you afford ever ſo little attention to conſider it. For that which formeth the new man in us, and gives us the courage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the world, that we may live pure and holy, is, as every one knows, the perſwaſion of the love of GOD, and of the remiſſion of our ſins, and the hope of bliſsful and glorious immortality. Now it is the reſurrection of JESUS CHRIST, that gives us all this aſſurance, putting in our hand a firm proof of the ſatisfaction of Divine Juſtice, from the deliverance of our Surety; and of our immortality, from his having taken poſſeſſion of the ſame for himſelf and us; ſo as our ſouls, being certifi'd of the tranſcendent goodneſs of GOD, and of their own happineſs, do ardently embrace his Diſcipline, and the endeavouring of a new life. Beſides, that faith which purifies our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

It muſt then be concluded, that in riſing again, he raiſed up us alſo by the ſame means; foraſmuch as by riſing, he gave being and clearneſs to the principles and cauſes of our myſtical reſurrection. Opening his own tomb, he by that means opened ours. He broke in pieces the doors and bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

O holy and bleſſed Communion! O divine and incorruptible fruits of the Sepulcher of JESUS CHRIST! The death of the firſt man did kill us; and the death of the ſecond maketh us alive. The one's Sepulcher is our priſon, the other our liberty. In the former do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear horror and malediction, the ſigns of our guilt, and of the juſt wrath of GOD; but from the latter, peace and life do bud out, glory and immortality ſhoot forth. The grave of <hi>Adam</hi> did extinguiſh, and ſhut up for ever in a ſtate of exinanition all the beauty, ſtrength, and life of our nature. The Sepulcher of JESUS CHRIST hath deſtroyed nothing but our ſin; it hath ſhut up, and kept in only our old man, that is, the loathſomneſs and miſery of our lives; and inſtead of this abominable body of ſin and death, whereof it hath diveſted us, hath, as it were, teemed with, and brought forth a celeſtial and immortal nature, which it puts on us, together with our Saviour. And thus you ſee what are the fruits of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with JESUS CHRIST, namely, the deſtruction of our old man, and the creation of the new, ſignified by the Apoſtle in theſe words, <hi>we are buried, and riſen again with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now conſider the two fold means, here intimated by the Apoſtle, by which GOD doth make us partakers of them. The firſt is Baptiſm, <hi>being buried</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with CHRIST by baptiſm, wherein alſo you are rais'd again together with him:</hi> For ſo do I take theſe words; rendring, <hi>wherein,</hi> not, in whom, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring this term, not to JESUS CHRIST, but to Baptiſm; as it it had been ſaid, In which Baptiſm you are alſo raiſed again together with the LORD; this conſtruction being more natural, and more convenient than the other; as they that underſtand the original Language, wherein the Apoſtle wroſe, with eaſily perceive, if they take the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In truth, all the means which GOD makes uſe of in Religion, have no other tendency but to communicate JESUS CHRIST to us, as dead, buried, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen again for us, to the deſtruction of our old man, and the vivification of the new. Nor do they ever fail to produce theſe two effects, in any of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them as they ought. Therefore the holy Apoſtles frequently aſcribe them to the word of the Goſpel, which is the firſt and principal means that GOD makes uſe of to ſave us;

As for the deſtroying of the old man, the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> attributes to the Word, the virtue that operateth and effecteth it in us, ſaying, that <hi>it is quick and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>

<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.23, 25</note> you know S. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth us, that the Goſpel which is preached us, is the ſeed of this life; telling us, that it is thereby we are born again. That holy Supper, of which we have participated this morning, hath alſo the ſame effects.

Their folly was therefore ſo much the more inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, for that they would not only retain a ſhadow, whereof JESUS CHRIST hath given us the true body; but alſo withſtood one of the old Sacraments of <hi>Moſes</hi> its giving place, to one of thoſe which JESUS inſtituted. If queſtion be of the ſubſtance, and very effect of circumciſion, we have that truth and fulneſs in JESUS CHRIST, whereof it had but ſome part ſhadow'd out by its figure. If the matter be the Sacrament it ſelf, the LORD hath given us one highly excelling, to wit, Baptiſm. So as which way ſoever it be taken, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all that any man ſhould deſire ſtill to retain circumciſion. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; it is not here only that the Apoſtle attributes ſo great an effect unto Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. He ſpeaks thus of it conſtantly; as for example, when he ſaith, that <hi>CHRIST ſanctifieth the Church,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5.26. Gal. 3.7.</note> 
                        <hi>cleanſing it with the waſhing of water by the word;</hi> and elſewhere, that <hi>we all who were baptized, have put on CHRIST;</hi> and in another place again,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> that <hi>we have all been baptized into one ſpirit, to be one body.</hi> For the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of CHRIST are not vain and hollow pictures, wherein the benefits of his death and reſurrection are nakedly pourtray'd as in a piece of Art, that feeds us barely with an unprofitable view of what it repreſents. They are effectual means, which He accompanieth with his virtue, and filleth with his grace, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively accompliſhing thoſe things in us by his heavenly power, which are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the Sacrament, when we receive it as we ought. He inwardly nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, by the virtue of his fleſh and blood, the ſoul of him that duly takes his Bread and his Cup. He waſheth and regenerateth that man within, who is rightly conſecrated by Baptiſm. And if the infirmity of age do hinder, that the effect does not at the inſtant appear in Infants baptized; yet his virtue doth not fail to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50919:116"/>accompany his inſtitution, and conſerve its ſelf in them, and bring forth its fruits upon them, in their ſeaſon, when their nature is capable of the operations of underſtanding and will. Heretofore in the primitive Church, this double effect of Baptiſm was more clearly repreſented in the external action of the Sacrament, than it is at this day. For the greater part of thoſe that were baptized, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of age, who came over to Chriſtianity from Judaiſm or Paganiſm, they were uncloth'd, and then plunged into the water, whence they immediately came forth, and ſo were baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; whereby they teſtifi'd, that they did put off the body of ſin, the habit of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and buried it in the ſaving-waters of JESUS CHRIST, as in its myſtical grave, and came forth thence riſen up to a new life; for a ſymbol where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they took up a white habit, and wore it an whole week. Now though the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherewith we baptize, doth not carry ſo expreſs a figure of this myſtical Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul cher and Reſurrection, as that of the Ancients did, ſince this ceremony cannot be practis'd towards Infants without very great inconvenience, and even danger of their lives, in ſo tender an age, and eſpecially in ſuch cold Countreys as ours; nevertheleſs, the virtue of holy Baptiſm is ſtill the ſame; that JESUS, whom in it we did put on, communicating to us, by the virtue of his Spirit, the myſtical image of his Burial and Reſurrection; that is, as we have ſhewed, the annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old man, and creation of the new. If we meet with any baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as there are but too many ſuch, in whom the old man is ſo far from being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, that he lives and reigns with abſolute power, and the new man hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life nor action at all; it may not be imputed unto JESUS CHRIST, who always accompanieth his Sacraments with his ſaving virtue; but unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons own unbelief, who doth wretchedly repell the operationof the grace of CHRIST, and deprive it of all the effect which it would have aſſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dly produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in them, if their unworthineſs had not fruſtrated its efficacy towards them. For I acknowledg, that neither Baptiſm, nor the Word, do work in any, but ſuch as receive them with faith. And in this, as in all other things, the admirable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our LORD doth appear. For the ſubject being Man, a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he dealeth with him in a way proper and ſuitable to his nature. The means he uſeth for his ſalvation, do not operate in him, as drugs and ſimples, by a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical action, and ſuch as takes its effect, whatever otherwiſe be the mind of the man that takes them. But the operation of the Word and Sacraments doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the preparation of their hearts to whom they are adminiſtred. They work, when they are receiv'd with faith; they produce nothing, when they are receiv'd with unbelief. And thus it is meet, that the underſtanding, which is the Guide and Ruler of all our moral actions, be firſt perſwaded of the truth of GOD, and then our wills and affections take impreſſion, and be changed by the efficacy of his power.</p>
                     <p>This very thing the Apoſtle here doth ſhew us with much clearneſs, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, beſides Baptiſm, that we are buried and raiſed again with CHRIST by faith; an evident token, that the Sacrament doth mortifie ſin in us, and raiſe us up unto ſanctity, according to the faith it meets with in us. It left the heart of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in the bonds of iniquity, and in the gall of bitterneſs; becauſe it found in it no faith at all, but a naughtineſs hardned in unbelief, and full of Hypocriſie. But as for <hi>Lydia,</hi> and all thoſe that have a true faith, it doth aſſuredly mortifie ſin in them, and makes the new man live in them unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and holineſs. For it is not poſſible, but that the perſon who is firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the truth of the Goſpel, ſhould renounce ſin, the venom and horror whereof this Divine Doctrine doth ſo clearly diſcover; and on the contrary, embrace that holineſs, whoſe beauty and bleſſedneſs it doth ſo magnificently ſet before us; man naturally flying from what he believes mortal, and pernicio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50919:117"/>doth by the way advertiſe us, that it is a gift of our LORD's, when he nameth it the faith of the efficacy, or of the operation of GOD; that is to ſay, which the efficacy of his hand produceth in us. Whereby their error is refuted, who hold, that GOD, for the producing of faith in us, doth meerly ſet before us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outwardly by his Word, or inwardly by his Spirit, the object of truth, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to the liberty of our will, to believe it, or reject it. By this account, faith ſhould not be the faith of the efficacy of GOD; ſince that, according to this ſuppoſition, he ſhould exert none at all upon us. But the Apoſtle ſtileth it, the faith of the efficacy, or operation of GOD. We muſt conclude therefore, that for the giving of us faith, he operateth in us, powerfully forming our hearts, and opening them by the might of his Spirit, that they may receive his truth; yea, that he doth imprint and engrave it on them himſelf by a moſt efficacious action. The term <hi>Energy</hi> (for ſuch is the Original, and 'tis that which we have render'd <hi>efficacy),</hi> deſerves great conſideration; properly ſignifying, in the ſtile of the Book of GOD, a powerful operation, which ſurely accompliſheth its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and infallibly produceth its intention; ſuch as is the action by which GOD created the World; an evident ſign, that the operation by which he produceth faith in us, is ſo ſtrong, as that it bears down all contradiction; ſo as none of thoſe upon whom he vouchſafes to put it forth, can reſiſt it, or hinder their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding from believing.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle addeth, that GOD hath raiſed JESUS CHRIST from the dead, either to determine the object of our faith, which is principally JESUS raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father; or (which I think to be more pertinent) to compare our myſtical Reſurrection with JESUS CHRIST's. For ſeeing it is GOD, who by his efficacious action giveth us that faith by which we riſe again in CHRIST; and ſeeing it is He again who hath raiſed our LORD from the dead; it is evident, that both the one and the other of theſe two works, hath the ſelf-ſame principle, to wit, the Almighty Power of GOD. Chriſtians, judg with what Power He worketh in his faithful ones, ſince that he exerteth the ſame virtue to give them faith, by which he raiſed his own Son from the dead, as the Apoſtle infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth us yet more clearly in another place,
<note place="margin">Eph. 1.10, 20.</note> where he prayeth, that <hi>we may know what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he ſhewed in CHRIST, when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi> Neither let his ſaying, that the Father raiſed him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet you, as if this did croſs the Scripture's aſſerting elſewhere, that the LORD JESUS himſelf rais'd up the Temple of his Body when the Jews had overthrown it.
<note place="margin">Joh. 2.19.</note> It is true, that he raiſed up himſelf; but ſince his Power is the Power of the Father, as being one only, and the ſame GOD with him; 'tis evident, it may be truly ſaid, that the Father raiſed him up; the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one of theſe two Perſons being the working of the other, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our declareth in <hi>S.

                        <note place="margin">Joh. 5.19.</note> that whatſoever the Father doth, the Son doth in like manner alſo. Whence it comes, that the Scripture attributes the Creation of the world indifferently to the one and to the other.</p>
                     <p>Dear Brethren, This is that which the holy Apoſtle, the great Miniſter of GOD, doth tell us in this Text. Oh how happy ſhould we be, if we had theſe Divine Inſtructions written in the bottom of our hearts, and engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Capital Letters upon all the parts of our lives! If our actions did ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, as our words profeſs, That we are buried and riſen again with JESUS CHRIST by Baptiſm, and by the faith of the operation of GOD, who rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead! But alas! it muſt be confeſſed to our ſhame, there appears in the lives of moſt of us, no print of the burial, and leaſt of all of the reſurrection of JESUS. The fleſh lives, and exerciſeth as horrible ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in them, as it doth in the lives of the men of the world. It hath all its ſentiments, and all its motions at liberty. The new man, that breathes nothing but Heaven, and loves nothing but Holineſs, hath no place in them; it is ſo far from reigning there, that it's baniſh'd thence, and acts no more than a
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50919:117"/>dead body faſt ſhut up in the grave. Yet if nothing depended on the matter, ſave our ſhame, impudency would bear it out. But the worſt is, our ſalvation, and our eternal damnation doth depend upon it: for JESUS CHRIST ſaves none but his Members, ſuch as are made conform to him, and have been buried and raiſed again with him. Awake we therefore from this mortal Lethargy, which hath benummed our ſenſes to this day. Labour we day and night in prayer, with ſighs and tears, and not ceaſe, until we feel the old man dye, and the new live in our hearts. As for the former, both Nature and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience do ſufficiently ſhew us the extravagancy of its deſires, and the vanity of all its motions.

                     <p>But the ſeeing of the vanity of the fleſh is not ſufficient for the conceiving of a due horror at it. Chriſtian, enter into the Sepulcher of your Saviour, and you ſhall perceive there, that beſides vanity, the life of the old man is all full of venom and wretchedneſs. This ſacred Body, which you ſee lying in that Tomb in ſo pitiful an eſtate, was pierced with nails, potion'd with gall, crowned with thorns, cover'd with the reproach of men, and the curſe of GOD, ſeparated from its Soul, and brought down to the duſt, to divert from you the puniſhments juſtly prepared for the diſorders of your fleſh. Think what Hells it deſerved, ſince it was neceſſary that the LORD of Glory ſhould ſuffer ſuch ſtrange uſage to redeem it from them. Having once diſcerned, by ſuch ſenſible evidences, the vanity and malignity of the old man, and the perdition into which he leads his Vaſſals, how can you have the heart to let him live within you? Beloved Brethren, crucifie him, and out him of the world. He is unworthy to live. Pierce him through with the thorns and nails of your JESUS. Give him his gall to drink. Put him to death with him, and bury him in his Sepulcher, to come forth no more. Let his Avarice, and Ambitions, and all his Concupiſcences, remain eternally extinct in the duſt of that ſalvifique grave, that there appear no more hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth any track of him in your whole courſe. And inſtead of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal vigorouſneſs wherewith he inſpired heretofore, and diſturbed your whole life, put on that new man, whom JESUS hath on this day made to come forth out of his Sepulcher. Drink in his Spirit, fill your veins with his Blood, and your arteries with his fire. Receive his Sentiments, and deck your ſelves with his Lights. Lead henceforth a life worthy of his Reſurrection, and of his Baptiſm, and of that immortal Food which you have taken at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Let your actions aim at nothing but Heaven. 'Tis there your Treaſure is. Chriſtian, what do you yet ſeek on Earth? Your LORD is no longer here. This day ſaw him come up thence, to go fit down on high at the right hand of GOD, and carry up your hearts with him, giving them all his motions, that where he is, ye may be alſo. And if his will do oblige you, to tarry yet a while on earth, ſpend the whole time in the ſame manner that he ſpent his forty days after his reſurrection in a continual meditation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

                        </gap>mp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD, and the ſweetneſs of that liberty he had given them. Under the New Teſtament the Apoſtles are no leſs intentive to repreſent, at every turn, the extream hideouſneſs of our original condition, for to make us acknowledg, ſo much the more, the grace that GOD hath ſhew'd us in his Son, by tranſlating us out of the Kingdom of darkneſs, into his marvellous light. Thus <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth in the Text we have read; wherein, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might be brought to a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler comprehenſion of the ineſtimable excellency of the benefit they had receiv'd from GOD in JESUS CHRIST, when they were raiſed again with him in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, by the faith of his efficacy, as he expreſſed in the foregoing Verſe: He now lays before them the miſery they were before engult'd in. <hi>When ye were dead in offences</hi> (ſaith he), <hi>and in the uncircumciſion of your fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now this diſcourſe does alſo hit the mark he principally aim'd at in the whole diſpute; which is, as you have often heard, to refute the pernicious error of thoſe who accounted the obſerving of circumciſion, and other Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> neceſſary for Chriſtians. Sure all the profit they could pretend to by them, was either the remiſſion of our ſins, or the ſanctification of our lives. But the Apoſtle doth here ſhew us, in few words, that we have both the one and the other of theſe two graces in JESUS CHRIST; The firſt, Since GOD hath freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us all our offences in Him: The ſecond, Since of being dead, as we were in our ſelves, He hath made us alive with him; whereby it is evident, that the Ceremonies of the Law are henceforth wholly uſeleſs to us. There is no need of the knife of <hi>Moſes</hi> any longer. GOD, by the ſole Goſpel of his CHRIST, dying and riſen again for us, the true Sword of Heaven, infinitely ſharper than any of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50919:119"/>Metals of Nature, hath cut off all the corruption of our fleſh. He hath done much more yet. By the alone vertue of the ſame CHRIST, he hath reſcued us from death, and animated, and made us alive. And as for the ſins whereof we were guilty, he hath pardon'd us them all. His pure grace in JESUS CHRIST hath effectually fulfill'd whatſoever <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law did promiſe or figure. You have had experience of it (ſaith the Apoſtle to the faithful at <hi>Coloſs), you have ſeen and felt the efficacy of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST in your ſelves.</hi> Remember what you were, when you believed on him; and conſider what you are, ſince you paſſed through his hands. Ye were dead, and ye are alive; ye were covered with crimes, and are fully abſolv'd of them. Do not ſo aſſront your Deliverer, as to think, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wrought ſo great Miracles by his own power alone, he does need the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law to finiſh his work in you; and that he cannot compleat, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Moſes,</hi> what he ſo magnificently began and advanced without him. This, my Brethren, is the Apoſtle's expreſs deſign, in theſe words.</p>
                     <p>We, who through the grace of GOD, are not troubled with the error of theſe falſe Teachers, which dyed, and was buried long ago; will conſider this Text more generally, and view the whole extent it hath, for our edification and conſolation, without inſiſting preciſely upon that particular uſe for which it was firſt written to the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> and that nothing in it may eſcape us, we will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, if GOD permit, the two heads which are propoſed in it, diſtinctly one after another.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, The eſtate we were in before the vocation of GOD in his Son; <hi>Ye were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, The grace that GOD hath ſhewed us in JESUS CHRIST; <hi>He hath quickned you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>together with Him, having freely forgiven you all your offences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is, in ſum, the map of our whole Redemption. The firſt part repreſents unto us our miſery by Nature. And the ſecond, our happineſs under Grace. That is, the archrevement of the firſt and of the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> the death into which the one had ſunk us; and the life unto which the other hath raiſed us.</p>
                     <p>There's none ſo ignorant, but knows what life and death are. As life is the ſweeteſt and deareſt of all our good things; ſo death is the greateſt and the laſt of all our evils. Accordingly you ſee, now prudent-Nature hath given Animals ſuch an Inſtinct, as to uſe all the ſtrength and skill they have, to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alive, and prevent their dying. Other evils take from us, each of them, but ſome part of our comforts. Death bereaves us of them all. Bondage deprives us of Liberty; Baniſhment, of our Countrey; Sickneſs afflicts our Bodies; Shame or Infamy our Souls; Pain troubleth our Senſes; Poverty incommodateth our life. But there is no calamity ſo great, as not to leave us the uſe or enjoyment of ſome good, or at leaſt of our ſelves. Death extinguiſhing our life, and by this means ſapping and overthrowing the very foundation of our enjoyments, doth at the ſame time deſpoil us of all other good things altogether. Wherefore the holy Apoſtle, and the other ſacred Writers, that they might repreſent the hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and miſery of the condition of men, that are without the grace of GOD, do not call it ſimply a Bondage, a Baniſhment, a Sickneſs, a Diſgrace, a Blindneſs, a Poverty, a Calamity, a Nakedneſs: They term it a Death; to ſignifie, that it is the utmoſt of all the evils that can betide our nature; that it is a privation, not of ſome good things only, but generally of all: ſo as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains either in the ſpirit, or in the ſenſes, or in the body of theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, that deſerves to be called good. It's the term <hi>Iſaiah</hi> makes uſe of, to expreſs the eſtate of people, while they had no part in the Covenant of GOD: <hi>Light hath ſhined</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>upon them that dwell in the region of the ſhadow of death.</hi>

                     <p>I well know, that the men of the world, and generally they that have no part in the grace of GOD, do live, and are ſenſible, and go to and fro; they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and fear, and hope, and exerciſe, in ſum, all the actions in which life is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily made to conſiſt. Yea, I confeſs, that to meaſure things by appearances, and the outſide only, there are none that ſeem to live but they, filling the world with the noiſe of their actions and motions, while the faithful for the moſt part groan in ſome corner, or paſs their days obſcurely in the ſilence of retirement, without appearing, or making themſelves ſeen; ſo as it may be ſaid of them, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as the Apoſtle ſomewhere doth in another,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.28.</note> that <hi>GOD hath choſen things that are not, to bring to nought things that are;</hi> the fleſh no more accounting the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be any thing, than if they neither lived, nor exiſted at all; and conſidering none but men of the world, when things that live, and indeed are, do come to be reckon'd up. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf clearly ſhews us, that he ſpeaks not here of the privation of this kind of life, in as much as he ſaith not ſimply, that we were dead, but that we were dead in offences, and in the uncircumciſion of our fleſh. We muſt know therefore, that there are two kinds of life; the one carnal and natural, which conſiſts in the exerciſe of natural actions and faculties, ſuch as are common to us, partly with ſenſitive creatures, as drinking, eating, ſleeping, and the like; partly with evil ſpirits, as ſinning, offending GOD, and our Neighbour. The other ſort of life is ſpiritual and divine, having for its principle the Image of GOD, and his Grace; and for its actions, the exerciſing of piety towards GOD, and charity towards our neighbour. Such a life as <hi>Adam</hi>'s would have been, if he had perſever'd in the innocence wherein he was created; and ſuch as is the life of the holy Angels now in Heaven. To theſe two kinds of life do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer two kinds of death; the one natural, which is the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body, and an abolition of the actions, and motions, and ſenſations, which the union of theſe two parts of our beeing doth produce in us. The other ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, which is nothing elſe but a privation of the Image of GOD, and of thoſe good and holy faculties, and habitudes, and actions, wherewith it is accompanied. It's this ſecond kind of death the Apoſtle intends here, when he ſaith, that we were dead in offences, and in the uncircumciſion of our fleſh. For the Holy Ghoſt, the true Judg and Eſtimator of things, doth count all thoſe for dead, which have not the life of GOD, how full of life ſoever they be, in reſpect of earth and fleſh. And truly for juſt cauſe. For if we conſider the thing in the light of true reaſon, we ſhall find, that what men call life in them, is unworthy of that name; it being, to ſpeak properly, meer death. For living, is right acting, and exerciſing of faculties ſuitable to one's nature, with ſuch ſatisfaction and pleaſure as he is capable of: So as the true life of man (for of him we ſpeak) is nothing elſe but a continual exerciſe of good, and holy, and juſt actions, ſuitable to his true nature, and worthy of that immortal ſoul which was given him at the beginning, with ſuch high contentment as muſt needs accompany the ſame. Now it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that thoſe that are in the fleſh, do do nothing like this. Inſtead of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and noble actions for which they were created, they do none but baſe and bad ones. Inſtead of meditating on GOD their Creator, and on heavenly and divine things, they dream on nothing but the fleſh and the earth, unworthily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in theſe bogs with all the ſenſe and underſtanding they have. Inſtead of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving GOD above all, of adoring and ſerving him with all the ſtrength of their ſoul, their whole will is ſet on creatures and vanity. And their Appetites, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50919:120"/>of being ſubject to right reaſon, do drag it into corruption and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Sure this univerſal diſorder in actions and motions, is not, to ſay true, the life of a man; it's a depravation, and an overthrow of it, which deſerves the name of Death, rather than of Life. As when a Clock is marr'd, and all its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons put awry and confus'd, there's no longer the going of a Clock; though it ſtill have the parts, it no longer doth the office; it hath only the name of a Clock, not the truth. So is it with Man; he hath ſtill the broken remainders, and ruins of his primitive nature; but the pieces being confus'd, and the wheels cruſh'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and all motions diſorderly, he hath no longer the true life thereof, he hath but a falſe and deceivable image of it. Again, acting in this horrible confuſion, it cannot be, that he ſhould have that pure and calm contentment, without which his life is not life. He muſt of neceſſity be always in doubt, in diſtruſt, in fear, and diſquietneſs; and at laſt fall under thoſe juſt executions which this diſorder doth deſerve; that is, into that eternal death which is the wages of ſin. And though he doth not yet ſuffer this final infelicity, while he is on earth; nevertheleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is infallibly his portion, and will eftſoons aſſuredly betide him, we are to count him even at preſent a dead man; and look on him, as on a Malefactor, that is on the point of being condemned and executed. For though he in the mean time doth live and breathe, yet we ſtick not to ſay, that ſuch a one is a loſt man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his puniſhment is certain. Thus you ſee it is very juſtly, that the Apoſtle rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons all thoſe to be dead, who are without the grace of GOD, foraſmuch as they do none of the actions of true life; and eternal death is unavoidable to them, while they are in this eſtate.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle's words do ſignifie ſomewhat more yet. For to be dead, is not ſimply to be without exerciſing the actions of life; it is an having loſt the principles of life, and a being incapable of doing the actions thereof. You call him a dead man, not who is ſimply without action, and doth not exerciſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation or motion (for they that are aſleep, or in a ſwoon, are verily in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet are not dead); but him, who cannot any longer act, nor feel, nor move; and with action, hath loſt the faculty or power of it. Sure then, ſince the Apoſtle ſaith, that carnal men are dead; he means, not only that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the operations, and motions, and ſentiments of true life; but that moreover they lye deſtitute of the faculty and power to act them. Himſelf teacheth it us expreſly elſewhere. For as to their underſtanding, which is the foremoſt and the ruling guide of all actions properly humane, he ſaith not ſimply, that it doth not comprehend the things of GOD; but moreover, that it cannot diſcern them. <hi>The natural man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>comprehends not the things of the Spirit of GOD,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
                        <hi>for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he underſtand them, foraſmuch as they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> And as for the Affections, which are another principle of human acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he affirms likewiſe ſomewhere, that <hi>the affection of the fleſh is enmity againſt GOD;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.7. John 5.44.</note> that <hi>it is not ſubject to the law of GOD, nor indeed can be.</hi> Our Saviour alſo ſaith of ſuch as are in this miſerable eſtate, that they cannot believe; and one of his Prophets had ſaid long before,

                     <p>But the Apoſtle here doth further ſhew us the quality and the cauſe of this death under which we lay before the LORD did call us; <hi>Ye were dead</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences</hi> (that is,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.1.</note> in your ſins, as he expreſly adds in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi>) <hi>and in the uncircumciſion of your fleſh.</hi> I acknowledg, this word is ſometimes taken in the Scripture for the external condition of the Gentiles; and circumciſion, on the contrary, for the ſtate of the Jews; whence it comes, that theſe two terms are uſed to ſignifie, one of them the Gentiles, and the other the Jews; as when the Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere, that <hi>the preaching of the Goſpel to the uncircumciſion was committed unto him; and the circumciſion unto Peter;</hi> that is, he receiv'd the charge of publiſhing the Goſpel to the Gentiles, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> to the Jews. I confeſs alſo, that theſe <hi>Coleſſians</hi> to whom he writes, were by birth Gentiles; ſo as it may be ſaid of them, that they were dead in that miſerable heatheniſh eſtate they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in. Yet I do not think that this is intended by the Apoſtle in this place. For
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50919:120"/>in that caſe, it would have been ſufficient to ſay ſimply, <hi>when ye were dead in uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> i. e. in Paganiſm; and there would have been no need to add, as he doth, <hi>in the uncircumciſion of your fleſh.</hi> Beſides, it is evident, it ſeems, that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth here a ſecret oppoſition between that uncircumciſion whereof he ſpeaks, and that circumciſion which the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had received from the hand of JESUS CHRIST, whereof he ſpake immediately before, ſaying, that <hi>in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST they had been circumciſed with a circumciſion not made with hand, by putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh.</hi> Therefore as by circumciſion in that paſſage, a ſpiritual and myſtical cutting off was ſignified; ſo in the Text, the Apoſtle takes the word <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion</hi> myſtically, and not literally; for the internal corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and (as he expreſs'd it afore) for the body of the ſins of the fleſh; not ſimply, for the external condition and mark of Paganiſm. <hi>Ye were dead in the uncircumciſion of your fleſh;</hi> that is, in the corruption of your fleſh; preciſely in the ſame ſenſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> meant, when he commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to circumciſe the foreskin of their heart, that is, to cut off the vices and corruption of their hearts. This myſtical uncircumciſion of the fleſh, is nothing elſe but the depravedneſs of our nature; the vices, and perverſe habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and qualities which have ſeiz'd on all its faculties; the blindneſs, error, and folly of the underſtanding; the diſorder of the will, and its adherence unto va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and falſe good things; the rebelliouſneſs of the appetites, and luſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

In the ſtirrings and motions of this hateful ſource, which boils inceſſantly in us, and caſts up filth continually, doth this ſpiritual death conſiſt. And I confeſs, in this reſpect, there is a difference between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the dead, commonly ſo called; and the condition of theſe ſpiritually dead, whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks of. For the former, as they do no good, ſo neither do they any evil. Their faculties are equally diſabled to the one, and the other. Whereas theſe ſpiritually dead men, have loſt ſenſe and motion, only in reference to that which is good. They have both quick enough, but it is only in reference to evil. They underſtand, they love, they deſire, but altogether oppoſitely to good; their thoughts and affections being full of error, extravagancy, and malignity. As for true good, they neither comprehend it, nor diſcern it, nor love it any more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> they had neither underſtanding, nor will at all. Whence it follows, that whereas the deadneſs, the inſenſibility, and unmovableneſs of other dead, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent miſery, deſerving our pity, and not our hate; theſe mens, on the contrary, is an evil infinitely culpable, and doth merit, not compaſſion, but abhorrence and execration, from every reaſonable creature. For that they neither do, nor can love GOD, doth not proceed from their being deſtitute of natural faculties of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and loving, but from a ſtrong and obſtinate rebelliouſneſs of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; and from that invincible paſſion which carrieth them to evil;
<note place="margin">John 5.44.</note> as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhews us, when he ſaith unto the Jews, <hi>How can you believe, ſeeing that you ſeek honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour which comes of GOD alone?</hi> An evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſign, that theſe wretched people's impotency to believe, did come from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their impiety, their ſtiff and inflexible averſion from the glory of GOD, and that ardent and invincible affection they had for vanity, and their own glory.</p>
                     <p>See then, beloved Brethren, what the condition of all men is, before the LORD doth effectually call them unto the grace of his Son. Where now are they, that pretend they have the power of a free determination, and a will equally capable of good and evil? that do hereupon conteſt, they can either convert them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto GOD (as ſaid the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old); or at leaſt prepare themſelves for converſion, and diſpoſe themſelves for grace; as the greater part of the Doctors of <hi>Rome,</hi> and with them ſome others alſo, do maintain at this day? The Apoſtle blaſteth all this pride in one word, when he ſaith, that <hi>we were dead in our ſins, and in the uncircumciſion of our fleſh.</hi> If a dead man be able to make himſelf alive, or to prepare himſelf for the reception of life, by any actions that come from him, I will yeeld, that the error of theſe men is not incompatible with the Doctrine of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> But ſince common ſenſe aſſureth us, that the dead are depriv'd not of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50919:121"/>the actions alone, but alſo of the power of life; and that there is nothing but a ſupernatural action of GOD, that is able to reſtore them to the ſociety of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſo as they can contribute nothing thereto themſelves; we muſt needs either charge a falſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>od upon the Apoſtle, who ſaith, that before Grace, we are dead in our ſins; or confeſs, in conſequence of his Doctrine, that men neither have, nor can have of themſelves, any action or diſpoſition unto ſpiritual life; and that the power of the hand of GOD, working ſupernaturally in them by his grace, is the only ſtrength that raiſeth them up out of this miſerable ſtate If their will be free, it is free to evil only; which it embraceth and followeth moſt freely (I confeſs), that is, moſt voluntarily, and without any conſtraint, taking all its delight therein. If their underſtanding do act, it is for error, which it doth conceive, and moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately embrace. But as for the life of GOD, they have not liberty, or light for it any more,
<note place="margin">John 6.44. and 8.36.</note> than if they had neither will nor underſtanding at all; according to that which our Saviour hath taught us, ſaying, <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father, who hath ſent me, draw him:</hi> and again, <hi>If the Son make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Without this, a man can have neither life nor liberty.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle clearly ſheweth it, when having repreſented the death, wherein we were, he adds, in the ſecond part of our Text, that <hi>God hath quickned us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with CHRIST, having freely pardoned us all our offences.</hi> For there is no doubt, but we muſt refer this action unto GOD, of whom he juſt before was ſaying, that <hi>He raiſed JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST from the dead.</hi> It is therefore the ſame GOD, who raiſed up the chief Shepherd from the dead, that doth alſo make alive his faithful flock, bringing them our of that ſpiritual and eternal death into which we are naturally ſunk; and putting them into a celeſtial and immortal life. As there is none but He, that could inſpire and quicken that duſt of which He formed us at firſt; ſo there is again none but He, that can expel out of our fleſh that death which hath ſeized on it, and reſtore that life which ſin hath extinguiſh'd in us. Both the one and the other vivification is the work of His hand alone. Yet to ſay, as truth is, it is needful for Him to put forth more might in the ſecond of them, than He did in the firſt. For if that handful of earth of which He created <hi>Adam,</hi> had no diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition at all to that form and life which He put in it; yet at leaſt it had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy thereto; whereas beſides that He now findeth in us no diſpoſition to an heavenly life, He meets with (over and above) reſiſtance and contrariety; a ſpirit of rebellion a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>tion to eternal puniſhment: In like manner that life to which GOD cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us by his grace, doth conſiſt in two particulars; firſt, a reſtauration of His Image in us, by the infuſion of principles and faculties of true life; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the remiſſion of our ſins. The Apoſtle here doth briefly ſpeak of them both; of the firſt, in ſaying, that <hi>GOD hath quickned us together with CHRIST:</hi> of the ſecond, in adding, that <hi>he hath freely pardoned us all our ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt, GOD hath quickned us, in that, delivering us from the death we were under, he hath put into us, by the grace of his Spirit, the principles of an heavenly life, and formed in our breaſts new hearts, hearts illuminated with a new light, to wit, the good knowledg of his Truth, and of the myſteries of his will. Then in the ſecond place, by the virtue of this Divine flame, he enkindleth in our ſouls the love of his moſt excellent Majeſty, charity towards our neighbour, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

From this new nature, as from a bleſſed root, do iſſue good and holy actions, prayer, worſhipping of GOD, frequent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and reading of his word, extaſies of love to him, travels for his glory, ſufferings for his Name ſake, relieving, inſtructing, aſſiſting of our Neighbour, and ſuch others that are as it were the flowers and fruits; in the production whereof, that life, which GOD hath given us in his Son, doth properly conſiſt.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50919:121"/>It's the ſame thing that the Apoſtle elſewhere compriſeth in few words, ſaying,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.10. and 4.24.</note> that <hi>we are the workmanſhip of GOD, being created in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST unto good works, which GOD hath prepared, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> And again in another place, that <hi>our new man</hi> (that is, the ſecond nature, which he formeth in us, when he quickneth us by his grace) <hi>is created after GOD in true righteouſneſs and holineſs.</hi> The holy Spirit being rich and magnificent in its expreſſions, doth explain this admirable and bleſſed operation of the grace of GOD in us, by divers terms, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from different reſemblances, but all amounting to the ſame ſenſe. For to ſet it forth, it ſaith not only, as here, that <hi>GOD hath quickned us;</hi> but alſo,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.10. 1 Pet. 1.3. Ezek. 36.26. Jer. 31.33. Rom. 11 23. Col. 1.13. 1 Cor 3.6. Acts 16.4. Phil. 2.13.</note> that <hi>He hath created us;</hi> and in another place, that <hi>He hath begotten us again;</hi> the ſame is meant when it ſaith, that <hi>GOD taketh out of us our hearts of ſtone, and gives us hearts of fleſh, in which he writes his laws:</hi> that <hi>He reneweth us,</hi> and <hi>formeth us into new creatures,</hi> or <hi>new men;</hi> that <hi>He graffeth us by his power into the true olive:</hi> that <hi>He tranſlateth us out of the kingdom of darkneſs, into his marvellous light:</hi> that <hi>it's He who giveth encreaſe,</hi> the Miniſters of the Word being nothing: that <hi>He openeth our hearts, and worketh in us effectually both to will and to do of his good pleaſure:</hi> and other like phraſes which are found here and there in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle addeth here, that <hi>GOD hath thus quickned us together with CHRIST;</hi> ſhewing us, by theſe words, the cauſe and the manner of our viviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; namely, that it was effected in JESUS CHRIST, and with Him, and by Him. For as that death which we heretofore bore in our ſelves, doth come from <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſtock and original of our carnal beeing, who by deſtroying himſelf, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed us alſo with him; and corrupting his own nature, corrupted ours like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; ſo as it is in him and from him that we inherit this miſery: in like manner, on the contrary, that life which we have now receiv'd from GOD, doth come from JESUS CHRIST, the ſtock and root of the new nature; who raiſing up himſelf unto life, raiſed us up alſo, according to what the Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>as all dye in Adam, ſo likewiſe in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST are all made alive.</hi> But this aſſertion of his here, <hi>that GOD hath quickned us together with CHRIST,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.22.</note> doth particularly refer to his reſurrection; as if GOD, in reſtoring him to that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, which he receiv'd at his iſſuing out of the Sepulcher, had at the ſame time given us alſo part therein. And he ſpeaks in this manner, for two reaſons principally. The firſt is, becauſe it was then, that JESUS CHRIST brought to light that bleſſed life whereof we have been made partakers; and from him, as from its ſource, hath it been derived unto us; ſo as that ſame time was the day of our new birth as well as his. For if he had not been made alive, no more ſhould we have ever been. Not but that the Father all had the might and power that was neceſſary to give us life again. But his Juſtice could not have ſuffer'd him to give life to any of the ſons of men, if their Surety and Mediator had abode under death. The ſecond reaſon is, That he being our Head, and we his Members; he our Pattern, and we Copies, drawn (if I may ſo ſay) from his Original; when GOD raiſed him, he re-enliven'd us alſo by the ſame means; ſince by this action he obliged himſelf to vivifie us likewiſe; it being evident, that without this, we ſhould not have that conformity with our Head, to which he predeſtinated us. Not to mention, for the preſent, the efficacy this Reſurrection hath, to form in us faith, and hope, and love of glorious immortality, which are the principles of that new life that GOD doth put into us by his Spirit; as we intimated in the expoſition of the precedent Verſe.</p>
                     <p>There remains now the other part of this bleſſed life which GOD giveth us in his Son, namely, the remiſſion of our ſins. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets it before us here, when he ſaith, that <hi>GOD hath freely pardoned us all our ſins.</hi> For the Spirit of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is as the ſoul of that new life he createth in our hearts, doth indeed turn away our affections from vice, and obſtruct our committing of unjuſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and impure actions, wherein we wallowed afore. Yet this reſpecteth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the preſent and the future; and if there were no more, the guilt of ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in time paſt, during our ſpiritual deadneſs, would nevertheleſs remain in its ſtrength; it being clear, that though the act of ſin be paſt, the faultineſs wherewith it commaculates him who committeth it, goes not off ſo ſoon. It
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50919:122"/>ſubſiſts ſtill, both in the conſcience of the ſinner, if he have any; and in the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Juſtice of the Supream Judg of the World, binding over the ſinner unto puniſhment. Whence it follows, that ſuppoſing a man be perfectly cured of vicious habits and inclinations, yet would he nevertheleſs be faulty, by reaſon of his fore-paſſed ſins; and conſequently liable, upon this account, unto the curſe; with which, and the terrors that precede it, true life is ſo incompatible, that it is not imaginable a man in ſuch a ſtate could ever reſolve to ſerve GOD freely and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely. Therefore GOD, that he may throughly quicken us, doth not only deliver us from the tyranny of vice, and of the fleſh, by that Princely Spirit which he poureth into our inward parts; but moreover pardoneth us all the ſins whereof we are guilty; and it ſeems in very deed, if we do accurately obſerve the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his action in us, that it's there he does begin, firſt remitting our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer offences, to the end that the ſenſe of this goodneſs of His, may cauſe us to love him, and encline us to obey him, and conform our ſelves with all our might unto his holy will.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle attributeth unto this remiſſion, two remarkable qualities. One, that GOD forgiveth us all our offences; that is, doth not impute to us any of our ſins, either in whole, or in part; but treateth us, as if we had committed none at all. Another is, that he doth it freely, and of meer grace (for ſo doth the word <hi>[giving]</hi> uſed here in the Original, properly ſignifie; as our Tranſlation hath well expreſs'd, by rendring, <hi>He hath freely forgiven us).</hi> The Scripture tells us not of any other kind of pardon. For as to that which our Adverſaries do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, to wit, whereby the fault is remitted, but the puniſhment exacted either in whole, or in part; or is bought out with the payment of our own ſatisfactions, or the ſatisfactions of others; it's a figment of their own Schools, of which the Holy Ghoſt ſays nothing any where; but repreſents unto us all that remiſſion which GOD gives the faithful, either at the beginning, or in the progreſs of their regeneration, as an entire pardon, and purely gratuitous. As for that ſatisfaction, by which our LORD and Saviour obtained it for us, it is ſo far from any way dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, that it does infinitely exalt the bounty of GOD towards us, ſince that he ſo loved us, as that he might pardon our faults with the conſent of his Juſtice, he would have his only Son to ſhed his precious blood for the contenting thereof. This is that we had to deliver upon this Text of the Apoſtle's.</p>
                     <p>Dear Brethren, Let us hold faſt what it hath taught us of the condition that all men are naturally in, before GOD calleth them to his grace. Let not their outward appearance deceive you, nor the pleaſures of their fleſh, nor the ſplendor of their pretended virtues, either civil or moral. All this is but a falſe image of life, covering a carkaſs that's ſtinking, and abominable before GOD. Make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that they are dead; and that if they walk, it is not a true principle of life, but ſin the poyſon of life, which doth animate them, and ſet them on working. The iſſue will one day clear it to us all; when the juſt judgment of GOD, having ſtript them of that fallacious diſguiſe which now hideth the hideouſneſs of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall ſhew it before Heaven and Earth, and make us plainly ſee, that they were but Sepulchers, whited without, and full of filth and infection within; and caſt them, thereupon, into that wretched and eternal death, which is prepared for them with the Devil and his Angels. Bleſs we GOD, who hath deliver'd us from this perdition by his great mercy; and hate we ſin, and the corruption of the fleſh, which had involv'd us in it. Look we on them as peſts and poyſons that deſtroy our life; and reckon we, that we have liv'd no more time than what hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from our ſerving of them. You deceive your ſelf, Worldling, who count the days of your unclean pleaſures, or your vain honours, the beſt part of your life. To ſay plainly, it was the time of your being dead, and not of your being alive. After ſo many years, as you have tumbled up and down the earth, you have not yet liv'd a moment. You have all along been in a ſtate of death. And they that write upon your Tombs, that you liv'd ſo many years, and died ſuch a day, do groſly err. You did not live, when you offended GOD and your Neighbour; or loſt your time in the filth of your infamous delights. And on the day that you ſhall quit the earth, you will not ceaſe to live (for to ſay true, you never liv'd); but
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50919:122"/>from one kind of death, you will paſs into another; from the death of ſin, to a death of torment. Chriſtians, if you love life, and hate horror at death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſin, and mortifie your fleſh. You cannot live, except it dye. Put in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe that noble life which the LORD hath given you in his Son. Act according to the Principles which he hath put into you by his Spirit; and lay forth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in good and holy works, the Graces wherewith he hath veſted you. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully love and ſerve him. Let your minds meditate on nothing beſide him, your hearts deſire none but him, your tongues ſpeak only of him. Let the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wonders of his love, and the hopes of his glory, be the whole food of your ſouls. Reſpect thoſe men in whom you ſee his Image ſhine. Affect them, and ſerve them for his ſake, looking upon their lives, their eſtates, their honour, their bodies, and ſouls, as ſacred and inviolable things. Endeavour to enrich them by communicating of your proſperities unto them. Offend no man. Do good to all. Let your charity and your innocence be conſpicuous in the ſight of GOD and Man. Faithful Brethren, This is that life, truly worthy to be called life, which GOD doth reward for the preſent with a joy and contentment of Conſcience, that's a thouſand times more ſweet and ſavoury, than any of the vain delights of the world; and which he will crown one day with that glorious Immortality he hath promiſed. It's for this that he hath vouchſafed to forgive us freely all our offences, all thoſe ſo many horrible Crimes which had merited Hell-fire; and is ſtill ready to pardon all the ſins we have committed ſince. This ſo great and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable loving-kindneſs of his tendeth only to withdraw us from ſin, and oblige us to love and revere ſo good a GOD. It's for the ſelf-ſame end that he hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up his Son from the dead, and enliven'd us with him, giving us faith, hope, and charity, the principles of a new life, even that henceforth renouncing ſin, and the fleſh, and turning our hearts towards Heaven, where our treaſure and our glory is, we might live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in the preſent world, looking for the bleſſed hope and appearing of the glory of our great GOD, and Saviour JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>DEar Brethren, That remiſſion of ſins which GOD giveth to all thoſe who believe in his Goſpel, is in truth, of it ſelf, a great and ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable grace. For who ſeeth not, but that it was an effect of a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent goodneſs in GOD, to be willing to pardon ſuch perſons as had mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally offended him; and conſent to their happineſs, who had obliged him, by their feloniouſneſs and ingratitude, to make them eternally miſerable? But the manner in which he hath pardoned us, and the price that our grace hath coſt him, doth infinitely heighten the wonder of this benefit of his. For he hath not forgiven us our ſins, by a ſingle act of his will, as a Creditor remitteth a Debt to his Debtor; becauſe ſuch a man having abſolute power to diſpoſe of his Eſtate, in favour of whom he pleaſeth, it is ſufficient, for his doing of ſuch a kindneſs, that he will do it. With GOD it was not ſo, in the preſent affair. His Juſtice, and the majeſty of his Laws, were concern'd in the favour he would ſhew us, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an oppoſition againſt it, with-holding and ſtaying the motion of his Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards us; ſo as his own ſanctity permitting him not to deſpiſe the voice of Reaſon, and the rights of Juſtice, for any one's ſake whoſoever, the will he had to pardon us, was not ſufficient alone, to bring it to effect. And here it was, that his love to us did ſhew it ſelf admirable, and truly divine. For ſeeing that ſin could not be forgiven us, without ſatisfying that Juſtice which we had violated; and on the other hand, that this inexorable Juſtice could not be ſatisfied, but by the Croſs of his only Son; this good and merciful LORD did ſo affect our bliſs, that to take away the legal impediments which Juſtice laid in againſt it, he reſolved to deliver up his Son to that cruel and ſhameful death; as our Saviour himſelf hath declared in the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">John 3.16.</note> ſaying, that <hi>God ſo loved the world, as he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> Here then properly is the higheſt pitch of this wonder, which doth juſtly raviſh men and Angels; that the pardon of our ſins, which GOD hath given us, was bought at the price of the death of his only beloved Son. And in truth, our conſciences could not have been aſſured of his grace without the ſame; Nature having plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our hearts ſo quick a ſenſe of the right that GOD hath againſt ſins, as we could not put an entire confidence in his mercy, until we might know, that his Juſtice was contented and diſ-intereſſed. Therefore the holy Apoſtle, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the faithful at <hi>Coloſs,</hi> in the precedent Verſe, the great favour that GOD had ſhewed them, in the free forgiving of their offences, doth now adjoin the foundation of this remiſſion, and the means by which it had been obtained. <hi>He
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50919:123"/>hath forgiven you; having effaced</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the obligation which was againſt us, that lay in ordinances, and was contrary to us, and which he hath entirely aboliſhed, having faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to the croſs.</hi> By this conſideration he giveth them to ſee the greatneſs of this benefit of GOD; and doth aſſure their conſciences againſt all the doubts that the rigour of the Law might raiſe in them; and particularly, againſt the contendings of thoſe falſe Teachers who would make them believe, that the grace of JESUS CHRIST was not ſufficient for their ſalvation, except they did moreover ſubmit to obſerve the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes.</hi> This ſhall be, by the will of GOD, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Exerciſe, and for the giving you a full underſtanding of this Text, we will conſider two things in it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, What this obligation is, whereof he ſpeaks, that lay in Ordinances, and was contrary to us. And</p>
                     <p>Secondly, How GOD did efface it, aboliſh it, and faſten it to the Croſs of His Son.</p>
                     <p>It's a ſimilitude very ordinary in Scripture, to liken Sin unto a Debt; whence comes that phraſe, which is ſo common in the language of GOD, and of the Church, of the remitting or acquitting of ſin, for the pardoning of it. Our Saviour us'd it, in the prayer he gave us, where the petition for the pardon of our ſins, is conceiv'd in theſe words in the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew, Acquit us our debts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 6.12. Luke 11.4.</note> 
                        <hi>as we alſo acquit them to our debtors;</hi> that is to ſay (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath interpreted it), <hi>Forgive us our ſins, as we forgive them that owe us,</hi> or that have offended us. This form of ſpeech was ſo ordinary among the <hi>Chaldees</hi> and <hi>Syrians,</hi> that they put the word <hi>Debtor</hi> for <hi>Sinner,</hi> or a guilty perſon, as appears by the ancient <hi>Chaldee</hi>-Paraphraſe upon the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Bleſſed is the man that ſtandeth not in the way of deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> inſtead of ſaying, <hi>ſinners;</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text of the firſt <hi>Pſalm</hi> doth import. And our LORD uſed the ſame word in this ſenſe, when upon ſpeech of certain <hi>Galileans,</hi> whoſe blood <hi>Pilate</hi> had cruelly mingled with their ſacrifices, he ſaith, <hi>Think you that they were more debtors than other Galileans?</hi> that is, more culpable,
<note place="margin">Luke 13.4.</note> as the <hi>French</hi> hath it. Thus alſo muſt we take it in that tradition of the Scribes and Phariſees, reported by S. <hi>Matthew; He that hath ſworn by the gift which is upon the altar, he oweth,</hi> or is a <hi>debtor;</hi> that is, he ſinneth, or is culpable. The reaſon of this Metaphor is founded upon the reſemblance of the things themſelves, <hi>debt</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> having ſome conformity. For as the one obligeth the debtor unto payment, the other obligeth the ſinner unto puniſhment. And as a debt doth give the Creditor a certain power over his Debtor; in like manner doth ſin give unto GOD, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Magiſtrate, over the offendor. For he hath a juſt power to puniſh the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as a Creditor hath to make his Debtor pay; though otherways, as we ſaid not long ſince, there be ſome difference between the powers of the one, and the other: publick Juſtice being concern'd in the puniſhing of an offender; whereas in a debtor's making payment, it is not ſo; whence it comes, that debts may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unpaid, if the private perſon, to whom they are due, be pleaſed to remit them: whereas Juſtice doth not leave a ſin unpuniſhed, though the offended par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth quit his intereſt to the offender. And this difference is ſeen in human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; where you know, that for the exempting of a Criminal from puniſhment, it is not enough he do content his Adverſary, except the Prince, who is Guardian of the Law, and the Conſervator of publike Juſtice, do give him an abolition of his crime. But ſetting aſide this difference, there is in other reſpects ſuch an analogy between a <hi>debt,</hi> and <hi>ſin,</hi> as the name of the one is juſtly applied to ſignifie the other. This ſimilitude is the cauſe that S. <hi>Paul</hi> here gives the name of an <hi>[Obligation]</hi> to the Law, or Teſtament of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The word he makes uſe of in the Original, doth ſignifie generally any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment written, or at leaſt ſigned with our hand, by which we confeſs our ſelves to owe a man ſuch or ſuch a ſum; and oblige our ſelves to pay him it at ſuch time, and in ſuch manner, as we have agreed upon. Such are thoſe which be commonly called Bills and Schedules. But becauſe of all Contracts of this kind, an <hi>Obligation</hi> that paſſeth before Notaries with certain ſolemn forms, is the moſt juridical, the <hi>French</hi> Bible hath made uſe of the name thereof in particular. An obligation then in Civil matters, is a Creditor's Title, and an evidence of the power he hath upon
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50919:124"/>his Debtor, to convince him of his debt, and compel him to make payment, if he do refuſe. It's an authentick teſtimony of his owing ſuch a ſum, which condemns him to pay, and makes his body and goods liable in this behalf unto his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Whence it appears, that this Obligation whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the Text, is the inſtrument of our condemnation, and an authentick declaration and demonſtration of our ſin, which gives valid teſtimony that we are guilty, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth us by this means to the avenging Juſtice of GOD, giving him a clear and undiſputable right to proſecute and puniſh us. All agree, that the word Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be ſo taken in this paſſage of the Apoſtle. But when queſtion is of founding the bottom, and of determining what properly and preciſely the thing is, to which this quality agreeth, and whereunto S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning was to give it, there is found ſome difference among Expoſitors; ſome conceiving it one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and others another. I will not ſtay to report their ſeveral opinions, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no way neceſſary for your edification. I will content my ſelf with repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you that ſenſe which I account the trueſt, and which hath likewiſe been follow'd by divers eminent ſervants of GOD. I ſay then, that this Obligation, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, is no other thing than the old Law, given in time paſt to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of them accepted at Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai.</hi> This appears, firſt, from S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying, that <hi>this obligation lay in ordinances.</hi> For every one knows, that this doth properly belong to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which conſiſted in a great many moral, ceremonial, and political Ordinances. The <hi>Jews,</hi> who are very exact and ſcrupulous in ſuch matters, reckon them up to Six hundred;
<note place="margin">R. Moſes ben Majm.</note> and their learned'ſt Authors divide them into fourteen Claſſes or ranks. The whole body of theſe Ordinances is preciſely the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo as it is evident, 'tis this Law the Apoſtle means; ſince he ſaith, that what he meaneth, <hi>lay in ordinances.</hi> He thus explains it himſelf, in a paſſage that hath great alliance with the Text in hand; where ſpeaking of the re-uniting of the Gentiles with the Jews into one only people, done by our LORD JESUS CHRIST; he ſaith, that <hi>he aboliſhed the enmity in his fleſh, to wit,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the law of commandments, which lay in ordinances;</hi> where it is evident, that he ſignifies the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> both by thoſe expreſs words, <hi>the law of commandments;</hi> and alſo by the nature of the thing it ſelf; it being certain, that this enmity of the Jews and Gentiles (that is, the thing which ſeparated them before our Saviour's diſpenſation) was nought elſe but the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, which the one of them had, and the other had not. The ſame appears again clearly, from that concluſion which the Apoſtle inferrs from this Doctrine, in the ſixteenth, and the following Verſes of this Chapter. For from his poſition here, namely, That the obligation which is in ordinances hath been effaced; he concludeth, that none ought to condemn us in eating, or in drinking, or in diſtinguiſhing of a Feſtival, or of a new Moon, or of Sabbaths; and again, that it is impertinent for any to burthen us with ordinances, ſuch as are, <hi>Eat not,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 2.21.</note> 
                        <hi>taſt not, touch not.</hi> Now every one ſeeth, that theſe ordinances do make up a part of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Certainly then, it's that Law he doth mean here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe it would not follow, from the aboliſhing of our obligation, that we are no longer ſubject to ſuch things.</p>
                     <p>But the truth of this interpretation will be fully perceived by an expoſition of the Apoſtle's own words themſelves, there being no other ſubject but the <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Law, to which all the circumſtances and qualities he here attributes to it, do properly agree. Firſt, He termeth it, an <hi>obligation againſt us.</hi> Secondly, He ſaith, that it <hi>lay in ordinances.</hi> In the third place, he addeth, that it <hi>was contrary to us.</hi> And finally, in the fourth and laſt place, he ſaith, that <hi>it hath been effaced, aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and faſtned to the croſs;</hi> things theſe, which cannot, all of them together, be verified of any other ſubject. Firſt, The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was an obligation againſt ſuch as liv'd under its diſpenſation; that is (as we have explained it), an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>alible argument of their ſin, and of the juſt power that GOD had to condem them unto puniſhment. For the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> proclaiming aloud, that all ſuch as failed to obſerve any one of its ordinances, are accurſed; it is manifeſt, that they all who accepted it for the terms of their Covenant with GOD, did by the ſame paſs condemnatory ſentence on themſelves, and ſubmit to the curſe; both
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50919:124"/>the conſcience of each one in particular, and the common experience of all in general; ſhewing, that there was not a man who punctually obſerved all things written in the Law. And as he that paſſeth an obligation to his Creditor, doth condemn himſelf to make payment; and if he fail therein, doth make his goods, and ſometimes his very perſon, liable unto him; in like manner, they that receiv'd the Law, and ſign'd it (if I may ſo ſay) after they had heard and underſtood it; theſe, I ſay, condemned themſelves unto the curſe of GOD, and did put their perſons, and all their goods, into the hands of Divine Juſtice; ſince it is clear, that none of them did ever fully ſatisfie all the clauſes which that Contract doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Therefore as a Bond given by a Debtor to his Creditor in acknowledgment of what he ows him, is an obligation, which makes it clearly appear, that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible to him, and deprives him of all excuſe, and leaves him no defence to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> contrary: So the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is an authentick obligation, which demonſtrates, and invincibly proves, that the ſinner is guilty, and liable to the avenging Juſtice of GOD, without having any conſiderable means left him to defend himſelf from that puniſhment; which it ordaineth for all ſuch as violate its commands. As for the ceremonies, I grant, they promiſed, in appearance, ſome ſatisfying of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of GOD, and ſome expiation of ſin, inaſmuch as they prefigured the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of CHRIST who was to come. But at the bottom, and in themſelves, they contained no ſuch thing in effect. On the contrary, they were ſo many obligations upon a ſinner, openly teſtifying, that he ſtood obnoxious to the Juſtice of GOD. For the aſperſions, and purifications that were made by waſhing, or pouring water upon men, did evidently ſhew, that ſuch as receiv'd them, were defiled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. And Circumciſion was a publick confeſſion of the impurity of our nature, which did declare that it needed to be cut or retrenched. And they that offer'd Beaſts to be ſlain for ſacrifices, did by that very act acknowledg they had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved death. Thoſe that obſerv'd the Faſts, and other mortifications of the Law, did proteſt they were unworthy to uſe the Creatures of GOD. And thus it was in the reſt of their Ceremonies. All their devotions of this nature were either images of the puniſhment they deſerved, or an avouchment of their guiltineſs, and ſo many proofs and convictions of their ſin. For to imagine, that theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ceremonies did truly expiate their offences, was not poſſible for them to do; both by reaſon of the abſurdity and extravagancy of the thing it ſelf; and alſo for that GOD had a thouſand times advertiſed them of the contrary, by the mouth of his Prophets.</p>
                     <p>So you ſee, in my opinion, clearly, how all the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was no other than an obligation againſt us, an inſtrument of our condemnation, an evidence of our ſin, and a juſtification of our puniſhment. Wherefore the Apoſtle elſewhere cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, in the ſame ſenſe, and for the ſame reaſon, <hi>the miniſtration of death,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.7, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;</hi> becauſe, in effect, it did properly ſerve only to form, and proſecute, and finiſh the ſinners arraignment; as affording full demonſtration both of his guilt, and of the penalty due to him; giving in evidence concerning his crimes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known the Juſtice of GOD in judging and puniſhing him. And hereto muſt be refer'd what he elſewhere notifies, namely,

                     <p>As for what the Apoſtle addeth here in the ſecond place, That this obligation of which he ſpeaks, doth lye in Ordinances, we have touched at it already, and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to that large multitude of Commandments wherein it conſiſteth. For I do not ſee, that any thing doth oblige us to reſtrain this clauſe to the Ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

And it ſeems to me, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's ſcope and aim doth ſo require: For he urgeth, GOD's having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50919:125"/>been forgiven us, in conſequence of the aboliſhing of this obligation, are generally all ſins committed againſt any part of the Law whichſoever, and not only tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And whereas the Apoſtle, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes, doth argue from this Doctrine againſt the Ceremonies only; who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that it is ordinary to reaſon from the whole, unto one of the parts? As when elſewhere, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> having laid it down in general, that the Law of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But the Apoſtle ſaith, in the third place, that this obligation whereof he ſpeaks was contrary to us. This, as you ſee, doth alſo ſuit well with the Law. Of it ſelf I confeſs, it is good, and holy, and prontable, and ſalutiferous unto man, as that that would lead him unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For it ſerves to convict us of it; as an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which being produc'd in judgment, ſtops the mouth of an unfaithful Debtor. It is as it were our Adverſary, that impleadeth us, and lays open our crimes, and brings upon us that condemnation to which we have ſubmitted, in accepting and ſigning it. And as for its Ceremonies, beſides that they witneſſed the ſin of thoſe who practis'd them, as we have ſaid; they were alſo contrary to us in another kind; even as putting a new yoak upon us, which through their vaſt multitude and diverſity was heavy and unſupportable.

                        </gap>per'y to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth conſtantly ev ry where, that it was diſannulled and abrogated by the death of the LORD JESUS, to make room for the Goſpel, according to the Oracles of the Prophets, that GOD would make a new Covenant with his people. Here is then the ſecond head of our intended matter, upon which we are to conſider, how GOD hath aboliſhed this obligation which was againſt us, by the Croſs of his Son. He tells us two things concerning it; the one, That this obligation is made void: the other, That it's by the Croſs of CHRIST it was made ſo. He expreſſeth the former of theſe with great elegancy, as his manner is; uſing three moſt ſignificant terms, all of them taken from the nature of civil promiſes and obligations, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſimilitude he began with. Firſt, he ſaith, that this obligation hath
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50919:125"/>been effaced. For ſo 'tis ordinary with men to do; when they have a debt paid them up, they efface the name of their debtor, that was upon their Books, and the ſum which he owed them. The Apoſtle ſaith, that GOD hath done the ſame in reference to us; that he hath effaced this obligation of our myſtical debt, which was written in his Law, and ſigned in our particular Conſciences. And this term hath the greater elegancy in this place, becauſe there did intervene, for our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting, ſome ſuch thing as men are wont to do. For they ſtrike out their deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors promiſes with ſome liquor, as Ink, or the like; which they draw over the lines of their writings. So was our obligation made null by the effuſion of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, to wit, the blood of JESUS CHRIST, which was poured forth, as may be ſaid, from the Croſs, upon that diſmal Book of the Law, for the effacing all the clauſes of our condemnation in it. For as to the writing of men, Ink is enough to blot it out. But there was nothing, ſave the Blood of the Son of GOD, that was able to efface this doleful writing of the Law, wherein the ſentence of our death was contained. Now it ſeems, that this ſhould be ſufficient to aſſure a debtor, even the telling him that his obligation is effaced. Yet the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents not himſelf; he addeth, that ours hath been taken out of the way, or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. Thus you know, among men, they that are exact and punctual, do not only efface their debtors writings, they tear them, and reduce them to pieces, that no ſign of their debt may remain. GOD hath done ſo towards us. He hath not only effaced the obligation he had againſt us; He would not have ſo much as the raſures of it to appear. He hath diſannull'd it, and aboliſh'd it, and rent it with the nails of his Son's Croſs. <hi>He hath</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>faſtned it to the Croſs.</hi> It is not poſſible to ſay any thing that ſhould be better or more elegant. Thoſe ſame nails, and thoſe ſame thorns that pierced the body of our LORD upon that fatal Tree, whereon he dyed for us, did by the ſame means tear and cut in pieces the obligation which was againſt us, that evidence of our debt, and inſtrument of our death; that is to ſay, in ſum, the Croſs of JESUS CHRIST hath diſarmed the Law, and diveſted it of that killing-force which it had againſt us naturally, and reduc'd it to ſuch an eſtate, that we being under the covert of his Croſs, it can no more harm us, than if all the Letters of it were eſtaced, and its Papers rent in ſunder. This divine crucified Perſon hath, by dying himſelf, made the Law dye: and that which doth ſometime fall out in the combats of men, hath been the event here; both the Combatants, even CHRIST and the Law, remained dead upon the place. The Law ſlew our LORD; who went unto this combat for us, to the end he might take and bear the terrible blows, the thundrings and lightnings of our principal enemy. But he hath alſo bereav'd the Law of life, and left it in the ſame eſtate it had reduced him to; though indeed with huge diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the iſſue. For our LORD raiſed up himſelf from that death which he receiv'd and ſuffer'd for us, riſing again the third day gloriouſly alive; whereas the Law ſhall never reſume the life, or the ſtrength, which he hath depriv'd it of. It ſhall remain for ever in that death he hath given it. This is that the Apoſtle teacheth us very clearly elſewhere, when he ſaith, that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST having been made a curſe for us, hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> His wounds have been our cure, his death our life, and his curſe our bliſs. The blood which iſſued out of his ſacred body, did blot out the ſentence of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and the blows, which pierced him, did break in pieces the inſtrument of our ruin.</p>
                     <p>Now this great and admirable effect which S. <hi>Paul</hi> attributeth to the Croſs of CHRIST, doth furniſh us with a clear proof of his Satisfaction. For if his death were nothing but an example of patience and humility, to what purpoſe ſaith this holy Apoſtle, that <hi>the obligation which was againſt us, was aboliſhed, and faſtned to his croſs?</hi> Who ſeeth not, but that by this account the Croſs of our LORD would have done the Law no harm at all? That his Blood would have been ſo far from making void our obligation, as it would not have made ſo much as the leaſt raſure in it? What doth his death contribute to my deliverance from that curſe under which this fatal writing puts me, if he dyed only to give me a noble pattern of conſtancy, and not to diſcharge my debts? The Saints have verily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50919:126"/>for our example; and their deaths are patterns of our patience. Yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found, that the Prophets or Apoſtles ever ſaid of them, by reaſon of it, that the obligation which was againſt us, hath been made void by their death; or that the evils which they ſuffered, have redeemed us from the curſe of the Law. And beſides the blaſphemouſneſs of it, it would render a man evidently ridiculous, to give ſuch language of them, or to ſay of them as the Scriptures ſpeak of the LORD alone, that they <hi>have born our ſickneſſes, and carried our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and been pierced for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities;</hi> and that <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon them, and by their ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude we therefore, that he verily dyed in our ſtead; and did ſatisfie, on his Croſs, the Juſtice of the Father for us. For this being preſuppoſed, as the Scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, there is no longer any difficulty; and it is clear, that his Croſs did ſtrike out and aboliſh the obligation that was kept in the Cabinet of GOD againſt us, and which alone had the right and power to deſtroy us. As when a Surety pays the ſum, which the man he hath given ſecurity for, doth owe; he voids the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that had been made to the Creditor about it (and by virtue whereof he was to be put in priſon), of all the force it had to endamage him. He effaceth it, cancels it, and makes it null. He renders uſeleſs all the preparatives of Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his friend. He puts the Adverſary, and all his Advocates, to ſilence. He ſtops the mouth of the Judg, that was even open to decree againſt him. He ſtays the Serj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ants, and ſecures his liberty from their outrages. This is juſt the thing our LORD and Saviour hath done for us. But what, ſay I, he hath done thus for us? He hath done for us infinitely more than all that this comes to. Death and the Curſe were due to us, as the wages of our ſins. The ſentence of it was written in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he obligation of the Law, which we our ſelves had ſigned, and wherein we had ſubmitted to this penalty. The Judg was ready, and Execution could not be avoided. The LORD JESUS, moved with compaſſion, and ſent by the goodneſs of the Father, puts himſelf in our room, as Surety and Mediator for us. He pays what we did owe. He ſuffers on the Croſs the puniſhment we deſerv'd. His Croſs therefore hath ſtruck out that redoubtable obligation which was againſt us. He hath aboliſh'd and made it of no effect. He hath broken all the forces it was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raiſe againſt us. He hath pacified our Judg, coufounded our Accuſers, ſtaid the Officers and Miniſters of Juſtice, and ſav'd our perſons from the fetters and torments which were prepared for us. But hence again appears how vain the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of thoſe is, who pretend that GOD doth but half-pardon our ſins; that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving remitted unto us the fault, he doth exact of us part of the puniſhment, and make us ſuffer it, either in this life here, or after death, in a certain partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hell, which they call Purgatory. How could they more rudely claſh with the Apoſtle's Doctrine? He ſaith, that <hi>GOD hath effaced, cancelled, and aboliſhed the obligation which was againſt us.</hi> Theſe men affirm, that he ſtill makes us pay ſome part of our debt. Sure then our obligation is not yet torn. It's a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of in the courſe of Juſtice, to bring an Action againſt that Debtor whoſe Obligation you have effaced. If it be torn, if it be made void, and of no effect, you have no longer any right to draw him before the Judg, much leſs to get him condemned to pay. If GOD, who doth nothing but according to Juſtice, ſhould make us pay any part of the penalties of our ſins, which he hath forgiven us; the Obligation, by virtue whereof he condemneth us, is ſtill in its full force. But the Apoſtle proteſteth, that it hath been effaced, and remains blotted, and nailed to the Croſs of CHRIST for ever. The Obligation which was againſt us, imported all the puniſhments both temporal and eternal, that we were obnoxious unto. It is voided, and nulled. We therefore do no longer owe any of them. Fear not, Chriſtian; you have to do with a faithful Creditor. Having remitted to you your debt, yea, cancell'd the evidence of it, and torn the Obligation; he hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at all, after all this, to demand any part of it of you. I confeſs, that the payment JESUS CHRIST hath made, is of no uſe to ſuch as remain in unbelief; and though he hath, in point of right, nulled the Obligation which was againſt us; yet their ingratitude and infidelity is a cauſe that they have no benefit from this kindneſs of his: Even as the unthankfulneſs and obdurateneſs of that ſervant,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50919:126"/>of whom we are told in that Parable in the Goſpel, did deprive him of the favour his Maſter had ſhewed him, in forgiving the ten Talents he owed. For GOD hath affixed this reaſonable condition to the Covenant of Grace, which he hath made with Mankind, that the payment of our Debts made by our Surety, ſhould not be allowed to any, but thoſe that believe; ſo as they that obſtinately abide in incredulity, have no ſhare in that impunity, or in thoſe other benefits which this great Mediator hath obtained for us. But as to the man that believeth, and by a true faith applieth applieth to himſelf the death, and blood, and merit of the LORD JESUS, there is no more any condemnation for him,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> as the Apoſtle elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaith; nor, by conſequence, any puniſhment: the obligation, by virtue whereof alone he could be condemned at the Tribunal of GOD, having been effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, aboliſhed, and faſtned to the Croſs of his Saviour.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee, Beloved Brethren, what that grace of GOD is which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath here made known, and by what means we may get part in it. Sinners, you that groan under the heavy load of your crimes; that feel your miſery, and perceive the cords of that damnation in which the Law doth entangle you, come unto the Croſs of CHRIST, and you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls. Your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces accuſe you, and compel you to ſubſcribe your own condemnation, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the juſtneſs thereof. But how juſt ſoever it be, the Croſs of JESUS freeth you from it; foraſmuch as it hath fully fatish'd for you, Beware of the error both of the ancient and the modern Phariſees, who pretend ability to pay what they owe, and even more than they owe; and to juſtifie themſelves by their works, that is by the Law. The Law is the inſtrument of our condemnation, and the miniſtration of our death: and a man, that would be juſtified by the Law, commits no leſs an extravagance, than he, that to prove he owes nothing, ſhould produce in Judgment the Bills and Bonds he hath given his Creditors. Confeſs you your debts. Diveſt your ſelves of all preſuming upon your own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Declare, that of your ſelves you are bound over to eternal malediction; that you have deſerv'd it: and do preſent your ſelves naked before GOD, who juſtifies the ungodly. He will clothe you with the righteouſneſs of his Son. And you, Faithful Brethren, who are already entred into this bleſſed Covenant, Live ye in peace, and quietly wait for the fruit of your faith, according to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of GOD. Let not the thundrings and lightnings of the Law make you afraid. Let not that death, with which it ſo ſeverely menaceth the ſons of men, terrifie you at all. Let not World or Devils, the Executioners of its Juſtice, aſtoniſh you. JESUS CHRIST hath brought to nought all their ſtrength, by effacing the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that was againſt us. Satan, thou cruel enemy of our repoſe, object not to us our ſins. We confeſs, they are greater, and yet more grievous than thou canſt expreſs. Lay not before us that clauſe of our old Covenant, which puts all that have ſinned under the curſe. We confeſs, we have merited this curſe. But know, Satan, if we have deſerv'd death, JESUS CHRIST hath ſuffer'd it for us; and if we have committed ſins worthy of thine Hell, the Blood of the Son of GOD hath blotted them out. His Croſs hath made void that old piece upon which thou makeſt ſuch a clamour; that rough obligation, with which thou inceſſantly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt us. How haſt thou the inſolency to accuſe thoſe whom GOD juſtifies? and to condemn thoſe for whom the Son of GOD dyed and roſe again? 'Tis thus, Dear Brethren, that we muſt repel the tentations of the enemy, and maugre his aſſaults, poſſeſs in peace the loving-kindneſs of GOD, adoring his bounty, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently employing our ſelves to his glory. For this is the ſcope and the end of his grace. He hath acquitted us of all our debts, and made void the obligation which was upon them; that we being raviſh'd with a Goodneſs ſo divine, might love him with all our ſtrength, and all our ſoul, according to that veritable Maxime, acknowledged by <hi>Simon</hi> in the Goſpel, <hi>He to whom much is forgiven,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 7.43. Luk. 1. 74, 75</note> 
                        <hi>ougth to love much. He hath delivered us, by his Son, out of the hand of our enemies, that we might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the days of our life.</hi> And indeed, how can we have the heart, either not to love at all, or to love but coldly, a GOD who is ſo good to us? who ſeeing us overwhelm'd in debt, hath freely forgiven us all? hath made void the obligation; and for the razing out,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50919:127"/>and making void the ſame, ſpent the blood of his only begotten Son; and for the rending it in pieces, ſuffered his Divine Body to be all rent with ſtrokes. After a goodneſs ſo raviſhing, muſt not that man be worſe than a Devil who loves not this Father, who hath given us his Son; and this Son, who hath by his death obtained our ſalvation? Oh how much reaſon had the Apoſtle to count him execrable, who loves not this great Saviour!
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.22.</note> 
                        <hi>If any man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>love not the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, let him be anathema maranatha.</hi> GOD forbid there ſhould be any ſo wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and odious a perſon in the midſt of us. Yet if any be, ſure he believes not of our Saviour, what he makes profeſſion to believe. For it is not poſſible to believe him, without loving him.</p>
                     <p>Let us love him then, and faithfully ſerve him, ſetting his Name and Honour above all the Intereſts of the World, and our Fleſh. Let us obey his holy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and conform all that life unto his will, which we hold not but by his grace. Let us imitate that Divine Pattern he hath left us, diligently walking in humility, and patience, and charity, whereof he hath given us ſo great and ſo admirable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Let us have compaſſions and tenderneſſes for our Brethren, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe which he hath had for us. He hath pardoned us all our ſins, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us all our debts. He hath ſhed his blood, to blot out the obligation that was againſt us. He dyed on a Croſs, that he might thereunto nail up, and for ever abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh all the inſtruments of our condemnation. Having experienced ſo great a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards our ſelves, how can we dare to have ſo little towards others? to be obdurate to them, and implacable, when they have offended us? cruel and inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when they owe us any thing? He hath forgiven us Talents, and we exact of them even Farthings. He hath pardoned us a thouſand and a thouſand crimes. We retain againſt them the ſlighteſt offences. What ſhall we anſwer, when he one day ſhall ſay to us, Behold I have forgiven thee all this great debt at thy requeſt; ſhouldſt not thou alſo have had pity on thy fellow-ſervant, as I had pity on thee? Without doubt, my Brethren, we ſhould. It is a duty too juſt, and too reaſonable for us to fail in. If yet our fleſh oppoſe, let us pray the LORD, to ſubdue it to his will by the power of his Spirit; granting us to do what he commands; that after we have had part here below, in his Grace, and in his Sanctification, we may one day participate, on high, of his Eternal Glory. <hi>So be it.</hi>

                     <p>DEar Brethren, The Croſs of our LORD CHRIST, which, at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, was a ſcandal to the Jews, and the ſcorn of Gentiles, is in truth the greateſt myſtery of the Wiſdom of GOD, and matter of higheſt admiration to Angels and men. In it, the Supream Majeſty hath mixed together, with incomprehenſible art, and reconcil'd moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and moſt incompatible things, death and life, ignominy and glory, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and abſolution, defeat and victory. The Devil having put it in the heart of <hi>Judas,</hi> to betray JESUS; and puſh'd on the Princes of the Jews to take him, and deliver him to <hi>Pilate,</hi> who condemn'd him, and cauſed him to dye a cruel death upon a Croſs; this mortal Enemy of our ſalvation ſeemed to have got the day, inaſmuch as by his artifices he had brought the Prince of Life to ſo ſhameful an execution. But it ſucceeded quite otherwiſe. The blow he gave our LORD, ſtruck himſelf; and our Saviour, by ſuffering of death, overthrew for ever all the power of the Devil; as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the <hi>Heroe</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who when he dyed, pulled down, and involved in the ſame ruins ſome thouſands of his enemies. This Croſs, on which JESUS hung, was, to ſay truth, the inſtrument of his glory, rather than of his ignominy; and the trophee of his victory, rather than the gibbet of his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. He ſuffer'd death on it, I grant; but a death that laſted no longer than three days, and got him immortality; whereas he there defeated and ruin'd the Devil, and all our Enemies, without recovery. It's this the Apoſtle repreſents to us in the Text, where in connexion with that he had ſaid before, namely, <hi>that the LORD effaced the obligation which is contrary to us, and aboliſh'd it, and faſtned it to the croſs;</hi> he now adds, <hi>Having ſpoiled principalities and powers, which he publickly made a ſhew of, triumphing over them on the croſs.</hi> Good GOD! what a change is this! He tells us of the death of CHRIST, the moſt painful, the moſt ſhameful, and moſt execrable puniſhment in the world, as of a triumph; and doth not ſtick to compare that fatal Tree whereon he ſuffer'd it, to a triumphal Chariot. He puts in chains thoſe that put him to death; and cauſeth them to go, not for authors, or ſpectators of his ſufferings; but for part of the pomp of his victory. This is the ſight, my Brethren, to which the Apoſtle inviteth us; the triumph, not of a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or ſome other of the World's great Captains, but of the Son of GOD, the Father of Eternity. In it you ſhall ſee this King of Glory riding in a Chariot bath'd all over with his divine victorious blood;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.1.3.</note> and as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> yer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while repreſented him, with Princes and people under foot, and he marching over them with his garments died red. In it you ſhall ſee, not Soldiers and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in chains, but Daemons, the Princes of this world, bound and fetter'd faſt for
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50919:128"/>ever. You ſhall ſee, not Arrows broken, and Cuiraſſes batter'd, and Arms cut in pieces; but Sin aboliſh'd, and Death deſtroy'd. You ſhall ſee the ſpoils, not of an Army, or a Countrey; but of the Lords of the world, and of the Governours of the darkneſs of this Age. Laſtly, You ſhall behold in it, not the image of ſome petty Fortreſs taken by aſſault, or compoſition; or of ſome River forced, or ſome Province ſubdued; but Hell finally beaten, Heaven gained, and an Eternal World brought under the power of our victorious LORD. Let us apply our ſelves to the fruition of this magnificent ſpectacle, and afford it all the ſenſe and attention that we have. To this end conſider we, Firſt, What theſe Principalities and Powers are, which JESUS CHRIST hath ſpoiled: And then ſee, in the ſecond place, how he made a ſhew of them, and triumph'd over them on the Croſs. Theſe are the two Heads we will treat upon, if the LORD pleaſe, in this action.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle ordinarily makes uſe of the words <hi>Principalities, Powers, Dominions, Thrones,</hi>

<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> he telleth us, that he hath the wicked in his ſnares, and makes them do his will. Not that he compelleth them to evil by co-active force, and how much ſoever they diſlike it; but their nature being corrupted as it is, he never tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them without effect, their ſouls voluntarily ſurrendring themſelves to his pernicious perſwaſions. Moreover he diſpoſeth of material things, turning and changing them at his pleaſure, raiſing tempeſts in the air, ſeditions and warrs among men; putting in commotion all that murtherous violence that makes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of mankind; and preſiding over all the inſtruments of the creatures da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and death.

In it, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil abſolutely domineered. All thoſe poor multitudes held he under his tyranny. He had put out the eyes of their minds, and in this blindneſs made them commit all kind of vileneſs and abominations. He inſpired into them hatred of the true GOD, and of his Service; and ſo effectually beguiled them by his fallacious illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that he cauſed them to adore himſelf under the forms of divers Idols. Theſe ſame ſpirits are they that the Apoſtle intends here by thoſe Principalities and Powers he ſpeaks of. For though the Scripture doth particularly mark out one of them, whom it calleth Satan, as the Head of this abominable Monarchy; yet it rangeth under him a vaſt multitude of Spirits, who all travelling upon the ſame deſign, and ſetting on work in it all the might and induſtry they have, do bear a part in his accurſed Empire. And there is great probability too, that they are divided into certain bands, each of which are drawn up under their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chiefs, and do all of them depend upon Satan as their General. For which reaſon it is that the Apoſtle calls them in the plural number, <hi>Principalities and Powers.</hi> Theſe are the Enemies whom the LORD JESUS hath overcome, and utterly defeated on the Croſs, as himſelf reported the evening before his paſſion, ſaying, that <hi>the Prince of this world was then judged;</hi> that is, was about to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.

                     <p>Let us now ſee how our Saviour hath ſpoiled theſe Principalities and Powers, and publickly made a ſhew of them, triumphing over them on the Croſs. Firſt, It is evident, that all this language of the Apoſtle's is figurative, and taken from what great Captains, that had been victorious over their Enemies, were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wont to do. For after they had ſpoiled them, not only Arms, Habits, Jewels, and Baggage, but alſo of their Eſtates and all their Glory; they led them away priſoners, and made a ſhew of them to their Countrey-men on the day of their triumph. This name the <hi>Romans</hi> gave to the pomps of that entry which their Captains and Generals of a Victorious Army made into their City. For when any of them had won a Battel, taken Towns, conquer'd Countreys, or done any great and notable exploit of warr, one of the principal and moſt prized Honours that were decreed him for a reward of his valour, was a Triumph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; which was acted with incredible pomp and ceremony. The Conqueror was mounted on a ſtately Chariot, magnificently cloth'd and crowned. His whole Army marched before and after him in Military order, every Troop under its Enſigns and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. The heads and principal of the Enemies followed his Chariot, bound, and in chains. There was carried along all the Gold and Silver, and other Treaſures, he had won from the Enemy. The Towns he had taken, the Rivers he had paſs'd, the Provinces he had ſubdued, the Battels he had given, were repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Picture, and expoſed to the view of the people, who with great feſtivity and rejoycing accompanied in throng, or beheld him from the windows of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and filled the air with their acclamations and applauſes. He entred <hi>Rome</hi> in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50919:129"/>This is properly that which was called a Triumph. The Apoſtle therefore fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his terms from this cuſtom, which was well known at that time, and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to every one, doth apply them to our LORD and Saviour, becauſe of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance we find between the pomp of his myſtical victory, and this Triumph of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cular Rulers and Captains. He tells us, that he hath ſpoiled theſe hoſtile Principalities and Powers. He ſaith, that he hath publickly made a ſhew of them. In fine, he affirms, that he hath triumphed on the Croſs; expreſſions, all of them manifeſtly taken, as you ſee, from that glorious pomp of the <hi>Roman</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs which we have now deſcribed; and which, for ſubſtance, do ſignifie no other thing, but that JESUS dying on the Croſs, hath fully vanquiſh'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Devil, with all his power, in the view of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                     <p>In proſecution hereof, we are to refute the falſe expoſitions which ſome do give of this paſſage;
<note place="margin">Themas. Loranus. Cajetan.</note> and after that, render you an account of the true. Some of the famouſeſt Interpreters of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do underſtand it of the deliverance of the Fathers, whom our Saviour (as thoſe men ſay) took out of that <hi>Limbus</hi> in which their ſpirits were, and led them to Heaven with them. <hi>He ſpoiled principalities and powers,</hi> that is, the Devils, from whom he took away what they kept in Hell; foraſmuch (ſay they) as he cauſed <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> with the reſt of the faithful who deceaſed under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, to come forth from their <hi>Limbus,</hi> which is one of the partitions of the infern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l Region. Then (they ſay) he led them, carrying them up to Heaven, and giving them entrance into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on high, whence they had been until then excluded. And he made them triumph in himſelf (for ſo the ſame Authors do read the Apoſtle's words), that is, He made them to participate of his triumph, in that they had the honour to accompany and enter into Heaven with him. But ſcarce can a thing be uttered more falſe, more forced, and more impertinent, than this whole interpretation. Firſt, That which it ſuppoſeth of the abode of the ſpirits of the old believers in a ſubterraneous and infernal <hi>Limbus,</hi> is uncertain and fabulous, being ſounded only upon the tradition of men, and not on any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the word of GOD. As for that which they commonly alledg to prove it, namely,
<note place="margin">Gen. 37.35.</note> 
                        <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſaying, that he would go down into Hell unto his Son <hi>Joſeph;</hi> they that are verſed in Scripture do well know, the word <hi>Inferi,</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> in that place in particular, and almoſt every other where in the Book of GOD, doth ſignifie the Grave. Whence it comes, that the ſame Patriarch ſaith elſewhere unto his ſons, that if any evil befel <hi>Benjamin,</hi> they would make his white hairs deſcend with ſorrow <hi>ad inferos,</hi> to Hell, as divers read it; where it is clear, that by the ſame word he means the Grave, into which the dead go down with their hairs; and not <hi>Limbus,</hi> into which only ſouls deſcended, who have no hair ſure. And as to what they produce of the pretended ſoul of <hi>Samuel,</hi> call'd up from Hell by the Sorcereſs her charms; where is the Chriſtian that doth not burn to ſee ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er granted the Miniſters of Devils over the Spirits of Prophets? God forbid we ſhould credit ſo groſs an abſurdity. That which the Enchantreſs ſaw came from Hell, I confeſs; but that which ſhe ſaw, was not in truth the ſoul of <hi>Samuel,</hi> which was at reſt with GOD, in <hi>Ahraham</hi>'s boſome. It was nothing but a vain ſhadow, and a phantaſm of that Prophet, called by his name, becauſe of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling him, as the greateſt part of the ancient Fathers did affirm, and as ſome of the moſt famous Authors,

Theſe captives they will have to be the ſpirits of the Fathers. But it is manifeſt to all that have the leaſt knowledg in the holy Tongue, that the phraſe there uſed by the Prophet, doth ſignifie to take, or to make priſoners, not to free them; and to lead, not into liberty, but into captivity: So as if this paſſage be meant of the Fathers, we muſt ſay, not that the LORD brought them out priſon (as is ſuppos'd), but that he put them in; a thing that would be infinitely abſurd and ridiculous The ſpirits in priſon,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3 20.</note> of whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, cannot, upon any better ground, be taken for the ſouls of the faithful det<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ined in <hi>Limbus,</hi> ſince thoſe ſpirits were ſometimes rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, or diſobedient in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> and periſhed in their ſin; which cannot
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50919:129"/>be ſaid of the Patriarchs, and the Faithful. In fine, the Apoſtle's ſaying, that the way into the holy places was not manifeſted while the firſt Tabernacle was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſignifies indeed, that the High-Prieſt of the Church, our LORD JESUS CHRIST, did not carry, not introduce our nature into Heaven, in ſoul and body; nor diſcover and make manifeſt the way to our Manſion of Immortality, until the veil of the firſt Tabernacle was rent; which is very true. But thence it follows not, that the ſpirits of the faithful, conſecrated before our Saviour's coming, did not feel the fruit of his death; and much leſs, that they were detain'd in Hell. But beſides that this Tradition hath no foundation in the Scripture, it doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſs the ſame. For our LORD promiſed the good Thief,
<note place="margin">Luke 23.43.</note> that the very day he was crucified, he ſhould be with him in Paradice; where yet, according to our Adverſaries ſuppoſition, he ſhould not have entred till the forty-third day after. And the Parable of that bad rich man doth plainly ſhew us, that at that time, as the ſouls of impenitent ſinners were caſt into the torments of Hell-fire; ſo the ſpirits of the faithful were carried up into the repoſe and felicity of Paradice. For that boſome of <hi>Abraham</hi> wherein <hi>Lazarus</hi> reſted,
<note place="margin">Luke 16.22, 25, 26.</note> was not a pit without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the pretended <hi>Limbus</hi> is counted to have been; but a place of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſolation; not ſituate in the vicinity of Hell, but ſevered from it by a great gulf ſet between them. And in truth, ſince the faithful did even then drink of the Myſtical Rock as well as we; were ſprinkled with his blood, did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his ſufferings; why would any one imagine, that our Saviour's Sacrifice had leſs virtue to introduce them into Heaven after their death, than it had to juſtifie, and ſanctifie, and comfort them, in the days of their life. As they bore a part with us in the ſame faith, and conflicts on the earth; ſo had they ſhare of our repoſe and joy in Heaven; neither is there any reaſon for our being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if you will needs have them excluded. Accordingly certain it is, that thoſe elder Chriſtian Writers, who did barr the ſouls of the faithful that deceaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, out of Heaven; did as well deny reception there to the ſouls of Chriſtians; not aſſenting that either the one or the other were admitted till after the reſurrection: ſo as our Adverſaries, rejecting (as they have reaſon to do) the one half of this error; and confeſſing, that Chriſtian ſouls, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged, are received into Heaven: it is nothing but pure obſtinacy in them to retain the other half thereof; and pretend, that the condition of the faithful, departed under the Old Teſtament, was otherwiſe than under the New. Be it then concluded, that all this pretended deliverance of ſouls brought out of <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> is but the fiction of an human ſpirit, not only beſide, but even againſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>But I add, in the ſecond place, that though it were as certain, as it is dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and as true, as it is falſe; yet it would not be poſſible to refer this paſſage of the Apoſtles unto it. Firſt, The ſpirits of the faithful departed this life, are not at all in the power of Satan, but in the hands of GOD, to whom they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them at their death; ſo as though JESUS CHRIST had brought them out of <hi>Limbus,</hi> yet it could not be ſaid that he had therein ſpoiled the Devils, ſince that to ſpoil them, is to take from them what they were poſſeſs'd of; and its clear, that though the ſouls of the faithful had been in this imaginary <hi>Limbus,</hi> yet they would have been there out of the Devil's poſſeſſion. Secondly, The word here uſed, which the <hi>French</hi> hath tranſlated <hi>mener en montre,</hi> that is, <hi>lead about for a ſhew,</hi> is always taken in an ill ſenſe, for a ſhameful and ignominious ſhew, ſuch as that of Malefactors is, when they are led through the City, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly executed, that the ſight of their ſhame and puniſhment may keep men in their duty. Now if our LORD had delivered the ſouls of the faithful out of ſuch a <hi>Limbus,</hi> it could not be ſaid, that he had made a ſhew of them in this ſenſe; it being evident, that in this caſe they would have accompanied his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph by way of honour; and that it would not have been any ignominy, but a glory for them, to have followed his victorious Chariot. Moreover, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's words are ſo placed in the Original, that the ſpoiling, and making a ſhew of, and triumphing over, which he ſpeaks of, do neceſſarily reſpect the ſame perſons, that is, thoſe whom he ſpoiled, are the ſame he made ſhew of, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50919:130"/>triumph'd over. Now he ſpoiled not the ſpirits of the Fathers, he on the contrary did enrich them; ſure then it is not them he made a ſhew of: neither can the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the verb importeth, be referr'd to them, without depraving the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's whole Context. This is all ſpoken of one and the ſame ſubject, to wit, thoſe Powers and Principalities, that is, the Devils, as we have demonſtrated, and as all do accord. They are the Devils whom JESUS ſpoiled. It is the ſame that he publickly made a ſhew of, and it's they again whom he triumphed over.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Latin</hi> Interpreter his ſaying,
<note place="margin">Zanchy.</note> the LORD triumphed of them in himſelf; I acknowledg, that divers <hi>Greek</hi> Copies do read the Text in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and ſome of our Writers have ſo expounded it; conceiving, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, upon his crucifixion, did bring the Devils, whom he had overcome, out of their Hells, and ſhew them to the Angels and the Spirits made perfect, bound and chained up, as a glorious token of the victory he had gotten over them, and they add, that this triumph did continue too, until his aſcenſion into Heaven. But the Scripture telling us nothing of this matter, I think it dangerous to affirm the ſame; it being better, and more ſafe, to keep to that which GOD hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his word, than to take liberty to follow our own imaginations, how plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſoever they appear. And the reaſon which ſeems to have moved thoſe men to advance this conjecture, is exceeding ſlender. For they have been induc'd to do it, only by conceiving it abſurd to ſay, that JESUS CHRIST triumphed over his Enemies on the Croſs; ſeeing that, to ſpeak properly, he overcame them on the Croſs, but it ſeems he triumphed only at his reſurrection and aſcenſion. But firſt, though there were, in this, ſome inconvenience, yet nothing would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force us to aſſert what they propoſe. It would be ſufficient, for the avoiding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to ſay, that our Saviour triumphed of his enemies in himſelf, or by himſelf; that is, according to the ordinary ſtile of Scripture, by his own ſtrength and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he being raiſed from the dead, and gloriouſly lifted up to Heaven, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of his own arm. But I ſay, in the ſecond place, that there is no abſurdity at all in attributing theſe things to the very death of our LORD; underſtanding them, as we ought, ſpiritually and myſtically. And without doubt, it is much more fluent and clear, to refer the laſt words of this verſe to the Croſs of our Saviour, of which the Apoſtle had ſpoken immediately before (he faſtned the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to the Croſs; having ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, over whom he triumphed on it, that is, on the Croſs); than to take it of our LORD himſelf, and ſay, that he triumphed over his enemies in himſelf, which is frigid, and harſh, and obſcure. Say we then, with the greater part of the Modern, and with the more knowing and illuſtrious of the ancient Expoſitors, that it is on the Croſs our Saviour ſpoiled Principalities and Powers; and that it was there alſo he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly made a ſhew of them, and triumphed of them. I confeſs, if we look upon him as ſuffering on that execrable tree, amid the ſcoffs and ſarcaſms of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the loweſt degree of his exinanition, Fleſh will find in him nothing leſs than victories and triumphs. But you know likewiſe, that this myſtery muſt not be judged of by the ſenſes of the fleſh. 'Tis faith alone that's able to diſcover and contemplate the wonders that are in it. Now if you open the eyes of Faith, you will eaſily perceive, that JESUS hath ſpoiled all hoſtile powers, on the Croſs; and that it is with this weapon properly that he ſurmounted thoſe ſtrong and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Tyrants, and took from them all the inſtruments of their violence, and made a prey of all their riches. For to ſay true, that harſh and cruel dominion which the Devil exerciſeth in the world, is not founded upon any thing but ſin. If this peſt had not infected us, all the forces of Hell, though they were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times greater than they are, could not have hurted us. It's upon our ſin that this fierce Tyrant hath built all his power, and it's upon our ruins that he hath raiſed his grandeur. For firſt, if we were not culpable by reaſon of the ſins we have committed, the Juſtice of GOD would never have ſuffer'd this Executioner of his Judgments to trouble and proſecute us as he hath done. It would not permit him ſo much as to open his mouth againſt us to accuſe us. But ſin having provoked the wrath of GOD, and his Law prohibiting acceſs unto his Throne, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a curſe upon us: it's evident, that the ſame delivered up our perſons to the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50919:130"/>evil Angels, and gave them power to execute its judgment on us. Again, beſide theſe evils, which are termed penal, and which could not terminate at laſt, but in an eternal death; the Devil did annoy men in another kind, even by puſhing them on to vice by his temptations, and making them commit a multitude of ſins, ſome by means of avarice, and others by the furies of ambition; caſting ſome into the exceſſes of luxury, others into the diſorders of drunkenneſs and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But it is ſin alſo that gives him this power upon men, to wit, that Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence which reigneth in them, and which the Scripture calls the old man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the inheritance, and ſucceſſion, and image of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> It's by this, as by an handle, that the Devil ſeizeth on them, and trains them into ſuch ſins as he pleaſeth: Were it not for this, he would have no hold upon them; and each of them, if he were exempted from it, might ſay, as our LORD did, <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, but hath nothing in me.</hi> Now JESUS CHRIST hath aboliſh'd by his Croſs, both the guilt and the vices of men; the guilt, in that he bore the puniſhment thereof, and ſatisfi'd Divine Juſtice for them, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd all the flamings of the Law, and opened the Throne of Grace to every impenitent ſinner. Their vices, in that he crucifi'd and deſtroy'd our old man on the Croſs, and mortifi'd all its luſts, and diſcover'd its impoſtures. Sure then its by his Croſs that he diveſted the Devils of the dominion they exerciſed over mankind, having ſapped and demoliſh'd all the foundations thereof, by his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſufferings.</p>
                     <p>As for that which the Apoſtle addeth, in the ſecond place, <hi>viz.</hi> that he publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a ſhew of thoſe hoſtile powers, this doth excellently well agree with his Croſs. For this ſhew ſignifieth nothing elſe but an extream confuſion and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, as we have already intimated; and who is there, but knows, that the evil Angels never receiv'd a greater than that was, wherewith the Croſs of our LORD and Saviour did cover them? They thought to have overcome him, and found themſelves overcome; inſtead of ruining his Dominion, as they imagined, they ſaw their own utterly overthrown. And this was publickly done, in the view of Heaven and Earth; our Saviour having been crucified in the greateſt City of the Orient, by broad day, and at the ſolemnity of the moſt ſacred Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val the <hi>Jews</hi> had. The Angels look'd on it from on high, and never beheld any thing with more attention and aſtoniſhment. <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles were ſpectators of it; and Nature it ſelf, however mute and inſenſible, ſufficiently ſhew'd, that it took part in it, ſhutting (if we may ſo ſay) its eye, through the horror it had to ſee its Creator ſuffer. But fear not, poor Creatures: The ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will wholly remain to our Enemies. Our Sun will ſoon come out of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe; and his ſuffering is the ſalvation, not the ruin or damage of the Univerſe. In fine, the Apoſtle's further aſſertion in the laſt place, that our LORD triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over theſe hoſtile powers on the Croſs, is eaſily verifi'd alſo. For,
<note place="margin">Origen.</note> as an Ancient ſaid, There were two crucified perſons on that Croſs; the one JESUS CHRIST, who was nailed to it viſibly, voluntarily, and for a ſhort time only; the other, the Devil, inviſibly faſtned to the ſame Croſs, and to his great regret, and for ever; in as much as this Croſs of our Saviour hath deſtroy'd his life, and power, having given him that deadly blow, whereof he will never recover. Faith ſeeth upon the Croſs, above, the Son of GOD combating, and conquering for us; and it ſees, beneath, all the bad Angels, put in chains, vanquiſhed, and in vain raging, under his feet. Yet do I ingenuouſly confeſs, that to ſpeak properly, the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and aſcenſion of our LORD, have more analogy with a triumph, than his death, which doth rather reſemble a conflict. But it's a very common manner of ſpeech, to attribute the name of an effect, to the cauſe which produced it. It's, in my opinion, principally in this ſenſe that our Saviour triumphed of his enemies on the Croſs; becauſe the death he there ſuffered, was the true and only cauſe of his triumphs. 'Twas the Tree of this Croſs that bore the Palms and Laurels he hath been crowned with. 'Tis there that all the cauſes and originals of all his glory are found. It is this Croſs that opened his Sepulcher, and brought him out from thence, and raiſed him up in Immortality. 'Tis it alſo that a little after opened Heaven to him, and ſeated him on the right hand of the Moſt High 'Tis
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50919:131"/>it that looſed the tongues of his Apoſtles, and changed the world in a ſhort time; that defeated Paganiſm, that is, the greateſt part of Satan's Empire; that threw down Idols, and drew all people to the ſervice of that Divine crucified Perſon whom it bore. It is the ſame likewiſe that will pluck us one day out of the hands of death, and lift us up into the Sanctuary of Eternity. Laſtly, 'Tis it hath found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that glorious Throne whereon JESUS ſhall ſit, and both the one and the other, his Subjects and his Enemies, ſee him truly triumphing; the one with eternal joy, the other with a confuſion that ſhall never end. Since the Croſs of our LORD and Saviour is the cauſe of ſo many triumphs, who ſees not, that it is not only with truth, but alſo a great deal of elegance, that the Apoſtle here ſaith, he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed on it over his Enemies.</p>
                     <p>Let us, Dear Brethren, adore the myſtery of it; and look upon it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſad appearances of its infirmity, as the only cauſe of the glory of our Head, and of the liberty of his people. If the <hi>Jew</hi> do ſtumble at, and the <hi>Greek</hi> deride it, 'tis an effect of their ignorance and infidelity. For our part, who know its virtue, let us ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>GOD forbid that we ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of our LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> It hath taken us out of the mortal bonds of the Devils, and put us into the liberty of the ſons of GOD. It hath ſpoiled our old Tyrants, and broken their Iron yoke, and overthrown thoſe infernal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers. Let us not fear them. After the blow they have received from the Croſs of CHRIST, they are but back-broken Serpents, that do but hiſs and crawl along the duſt. I grant, they yet ſtir, and wind about us, and do not ceaſe to threaten us. But they can no longer hurt us, if we keep faſt to the Croſs of our Saviour, by which the world is crucified unto us, and we unto the world. They are our Enemies, they are no more our Maſters. We are to wreſtle with them; we are under their yoke no longer. And if GOD do ſometimes permit them to ſtrike us, in our goods, or in our bodies, and what we have on earth; yet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth our perſons, and doth not ſuffer them to take from us any thing that his Son hath purchaſed in Heaven for us. And he ſo governeth theſe Combats, that they ever turn unto our glory, and their confuſion, as that of <hi>Job</hi>'s yer while did. GOD permits them to attaque us, that we may overcome them; or to ſay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Croſs of JESUS may ſtand up once more victorious in each of us, and bruiſe Satan under our feet,
<note place="margin">Rom. 16.26.</note> as it hath already bruiſed him under his. Let us, with good courage, follow the victory of our Head, and ſtoutly march on in his ſteps. Let us purſue the vanquiſhed Enemy, and not quit him till we, in this holy warr, do bear away the Laurel, and the honour of a Triumph. Take heed he ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not his diſſipated Forces, and do us ſome affront. For henceforth there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our wretchleſneſs that can give him the advantage. Our Victory is as ſure as may be, if we have ſo much courage as not to deſtroy our ſelves. For what can he do to us, if we watch, if we pray, if we keep upon our guard, and under the Enſign of the Croſs of our LORD? Will he accuſe us? GOD doth juſtifie us, and his Son doth defend and intercede for us. Will he batter us with the curſe of the Law? The Croſs of CHRIST hath annulled that. Will he ſtir up againſt us the hate and perſecutions of the world? In theſe things we are more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors through him that loved us; and that can ſo turn and change them in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of us, as they ſhall all work together for our good. Will he take hold of us, on the other ſide, by the baits of ſin, and pleaſures and benefits of the preſent world? Our Saviour's Croſs hath extinguiſh'd and mortified the deſire of them in our hearts; ſhewing us that all this beauteous figure of the World is but a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that paſſeth away, and endeth in eternal miſery. Will he menace us with death? He may; but the Croſs of JESUS hath diſarmed it of all its ſtings; and ſo altered its whole nature, that whereas it was, of it ſelf, the wages of ſin, and an effect of our Judge's wrath, and the beginning of Hell; it is now a token to us of the grace of GOD, the end of our Combats, and the entry of our Paradice. Let us therefore, my beloved Brethren, live in repoſe, and take fruition, with humble thankfulneſs, of the good things which the LORD JESUS hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us, by the merit of his Croſs; ſerving, and religiouſly adoring him; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating all our life to his glory, as he gave his for our ſalvation; and aſſuring
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50919:131"/>our ſelves amid all the ſtorms of this generation; that <hi>neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come; nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be ever able to ſeparate us from the love of GOD, which he hath ſhewed us in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST our LORD.</hi> So be it.</p>

                     <p>DEar Brethren, Our LORD JESUS CHRIST doth excellently ſhew us the difference of that Evangelical ſervice which he hath inſtituted in his Church, from the Legal ſervice which had place in <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Old Teſtament; when ſpeaking of it to the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Woman,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 4.21, 23</note> 
                        <hi>believe me, the hour cometh, that neither in this mountain, nor at Jeruſalem, ſhall ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Father; But the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> Under the Law, the ſervice of GOD was affixed to certain places, as the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> to certain times, as Sabbaths, New Moons, and thoſe great Feaſts of the Paſſover, Pentecoſt, and Tabernacles; to certain corporeal things, as Beaſts, and other Kinds, which were offered upon a material Altar, with divers ceremonies; and to certain ſorts of Meat; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not permitted at that time to eat of any other. But now the LORD JESUS hath abrogated this adhering to places, to times, and to the elements of this world, as a low and childiſh exerciſe; and appointed for his people a ſervice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſpiritual and divine, proportioned to that admirable light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which he hath ſhed into the hearts of the faithful; a ſervice that wholly conſiſteth in love to GOD, charity and beneficence towards our Neighbour, and in honeſty and purity in reſpect of our ſelves. This is the true ſervice of the Deity; worthy of man that preſents it, and of GOD that receives it; ſince man is a reaſonable Creature, and GOD a Spirit infinitely good and holy; according to what our Saviour addeth, that the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him; and that being a Spirit, they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth. But though this kind of ſervice be ſo juſt and ſo rational in its ſelf; and though the LORD JESUS have ſo clearly inſtituted it by his Divine Authority; yet, on the other part, the inclination of our nature is ſo violent towards groſs and earthly things, that even among thoſe who make profeſſion of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing JESUS CHRIST for the Son of GOD, a multitude is found that cannot let go theſe bodily exerciſes, in which a part of Divine Service did heretofore conſiſt. The Apoſtle teſtifies in divers places, that there were ſuch in his time;
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.3.</note> and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50919:132"/>he advertiſeth us in others, that there would alſo be ſuch in after-ages; and the event hath preciſely anſwered his prediction: an evident ſign, it was the Spirit of Truth, that is, the Spirit of GOD, which illuminated his underſtanding, and cauſed him to ſee in thoſe days, things hidden in a time to come, ſo far beyond the reach of the natural ſight of men. It's againſt theſe people that he laboureth, in this Chapter, for to defend from their abuſing them, not only the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to whom he writes, but alſo the faithful of all Ages. He laid firm and unmovable foundations of the truth, in his foregoing diſcourſe; and the ſame, as his manner is, with great ſtrength, and glorious evidence; ſhewing us, that we have all thoſe advantages plentifully in JESUS CHRIST, upon pretence of which, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror would introduce its inventions and carnal obſervations; that in him we have all fulneſs neceſſary to compleat us; that his Reſurrection and his Spirit do diveſt us of all the vices of the fleſh; and that his Croſs doth give us full remiſſion of our ſins; ſince it hath both made void the obligation concerning all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we owed to Divine Juſtice; and triumphed of all thoſe powers that were capable of accuſing or tormenting us. Whence it clearly followeth, that it's a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for any to go about to oblige us unto legal and material obſervations, ſeeing that we moſt perfectly have, in the death and reſurrection of our LORD, all that ſanctification and juſtification, for the advancing of which it is pretended that theſe things do ſerve. This is, Dear Brethren, the direct concluſion that the Apoſtle doth now deduce from that excellent and divine Doctrine which he eſtabliſhed afore. Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>let no man condemn you in meat, or in drink, or in the diſtinction of a feſtival day, or of a new moon, or of ſabbaths. Which things are ſhadows of thoſe that were to come, but the body of them is in CHRIST.</hi> He firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them to ſuffer themſelves to be put in ſubjection to theſe legal things; and next, he brings them a reaſon for it, taken from their nature, for that theſe things were but ſhadows; of which JESUS CHRIST hath exhibited to us, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the true body. Theſe ſhall be, by the will of GOD, the two points we will handle in this Exerciſe; obſerving, in the one and the other of them, what we ſhall judg conducible to your edification.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Seducers, whom the Apoſtle oppoſeth in this place, had drawn the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions which they would add to the Goſpel, partly from the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, partly from Heathen Philoſophy, and partly out of their own imagination; whence it comes, that in one of the precedent Verſes he adviſed the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to <hi>beware that no one made a prey of them by philoſophy and vain deceit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 2.8.</note> 
                        <hi>after the tradition of men, and the rudiments of the world.</hi> They had borrowed from <hi>Moſes,</hi> circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the diſtinction of meats and days. They had beg'd from the Schools of Philoſophy, the worſhipping of Angels, and the vain diſcourſes wherewith they colour'd over this abuſe; and they had invented of themſelves certain auſterities and pretended mortifications, of which they made great account in Religion. See, I beſeech you, what an heap of ſtrange things the Spirit of Superſtition did, even at that time, thruſt into Chriſtianity; that you be not amazed, if men, in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages as have rouled down ſince thoſe days, purſuing the ſame deſign unheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the paſſion of their fleſh, have by little and little quite fill'd up Religion with the like ſervices and obſervations; and, as it were foul'd and dirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that pure and clear Fountain of our Saviour's Diſcipline, with the dregs and ſediment of their inventions. For if fleſh had the impudence to promote ſuch abuſes, during the lives, and under the eyes of the Apoſtles; how much more would it have the boldneſs to enterpriſe, and facility to execute it, during the night of ſo many ages, which were not only deſtitute of the light of thoſe great Tapers, but alſo overſpread with the darkneſs of groſſeſt ignorance. But let us ſee how S. <hi>Paul</hi> condemneth the Traditions of thoſe of his age, to the end we may preſerve our ſelves from thoſe of our own, by the example and authority of his Doctrine. He ſpake before of circumciſion, to which they would have had Chriſtians ſtill ſubmit themſelves. He now takes to task their other abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and firſt, the diſtinction they made of days, and of meats; and next, in the verſes following, their Doctrine touching Angels, and the worſhip they gave them; and laſt of all, their Diſciplines and Mortifications, from the 20th Verſe
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50919:132"/>to the end of the chapter. We will ſee, by the grace of GOD, the two other parts of His diſpute, each of them in its place. As for the former, the Apoſtle taxeth here two ſorts of deſtinctions, or obſervations, which theſe men made in religion; the one of meats, the other of days. And as to the latter, he noteth particularly, and by name, ſome of the days, which they obſerved, to wit, <hi>Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, new Moons, and Sabbaths.</hi> But about the other, he expreſſeth himſelf in general only, ſaying ſimply, <hi>Let no man condemn you in meat, or in drink,</hi> without declaring particularly the kind of meat, or drink, which they prohibited, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; ſo as, the Apoſtle not telling it us, and we having no light in it neither any other way, it is not eaſy for us to know preciſely, what the meats were, the diſtinction whereof theſe people did ſet up. For firſt, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whence they had taken ſome part of their diſcipline, did forbid a great number of meats, and contained ſeveral very ſcrupulous regulations about eating, as you may ſee in the eleventh chapter of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and in other places: Among the beaſts of the field, it permitted the Jews to take none for meat, but ſuch as <hi>chew the cud, and divide the hoof:</hi> and among fiſhes, <hi>none but ſuch as have fins, and ſcales:</hi> and by this rule, it baniſh'd from their tables, Hares, Rabbets, Leverets, The Hog, the Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prey, the Tortoiſe, and many other kinds: that I may not ſpeak of ſeveral ſorts of birds, which were interdicted them. It was an abomination for them, ſo much as to touch any of theſe things. And for drink, though there was no general rule given, yet they had divers particular obſervations which do referr unto it; as for inſtance,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

For this cauſe, <hi>Daniel,</hi> and his fellows,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.8.</note> would not taſte of the meat, or of the wine of the King of <hi>Babylon's</hi> table: deſiring rather to eat nothing but pulſe, and drink nothing but water, then put themſelves upon the danger of being defiled. And hereto we muſt referr, that eating herbs, which the Apoſtle reports of thoſe weak ones,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.2.</note> who ſtill retained the Moſaical diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of meats. The meaning is, that living among Pagans, and fearing leſt the victuals they ſold in their ſhambles, and ſhops were defiled one way or other, they forbore them, and reſtrain'd themſelves to herbs, in which they feared no ſuch thing. The Judaical rules about eating and drinking being ſuch, it is hard to ſay, whether the Seducers reteined them all in general, or obſerved only part of them. Great probability there is, that they adhered to them in ſome ſort, either in whole, or in part. Yet drawing a part of their obſervations (as they did) from the ſinks of ſecular Philoſophy, it might well be, that beſide what they had taken out of Judaiſm to this purpoſe, they did mingle with it ſome obſervances of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers alſo, who likewiſe had their abſtinences, as we underſtand by the books of the ancients. And that of the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> is ſufficiently known who fed on herbs, and fruits only, forbidding the uſe of all animated things. It is very likely, that thoſe falſe Apoſtles, upon whom <hi>S. Paul</hi> hath his eye here, had ſome ſuch diſcipline, conſidering that which he addeth afterwards, of the nature, and ends of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinences. And this is that, which we may ſay, concerning their laws about the matter of eating and drinking.</p>
                     <p>As for the days, which they obſerved; all thoſe, that the Apoſtle nameth in the Text, were taken out of Judaiſm. For that the new Moons, by which the Hebrews began all the months of their year, (as the moſt part of the people of the Eaſt do to this day) that they, I ſay, were ſolemnly obſerv'd among the Jews, do's appear, both by divers places in <hi>Moſes;</hi> where he ordeineth,

So, you ſee, the Apoſtle doth here point at all the three kinds of Jewiſh feaſts; thoſe of the year, which he calleth ſimply, feſtivals: to wit, the Paſſeover. Pentecoſt, and the Tabernacles: thoſe of months, which were the new Moons; and in fine, thoſe of the weeks, which were the Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas, the French hath tranſlated it, in the diſtinction of a feſtival day, it is word for word in the original, in part of a feſtival day which ſome take to ſignify, in reſpect of feſtivals, or upon the account of feſtivals: in the ſame ſenſe, that S.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16.</note> 
                        <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to uſe the word, when he ſaith, <hi>If any man ſuffer, as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorify GOD in this part, or in this behalf,</hi> that is, in this reſpect, and as to this matter. And thus the Apoſtle in this place would ſay, <hi>let no man condemn you in regard of feſtivals; or for feſtivals;</hi> that is, in the matter of the obſervation of certain dayes. But the word here uſed, being the root of that other, which in Greek ſignifies to diſtinguiſh, to ſever, to divide; as in French, partir, and partager, do come from the word part, or partie; that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter hath not ſucceeded ill, in rendring it, the diſtinction. For they, that keep holy certain dayes, and make them feſtival, do diſtinguiſh them from others, and ſet them apart to obſerve, and celebrate them quite otherwiſe, then they do other dayes. For ſubſtance, the Apoſtles intention is clear; namely, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids every man, whoever he be, to condemn Chriſtians, in reſpect of the uſe of certain meats, and the obſerving of certain dayes. <hi>Let no man condemn you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in eating, or in drinking, or in diſtinguiſhing of a feſtival day, or of a new Moon, or of Sabbaths.</hi> It is properly in the Original, Let no man judge you; and this word doth aptly ſuite the Apoſtle's ſenſe. For theſe Seducers would make their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, about the diſtinction of meats, and dayes, to paſs for neceſſary laws: which they meant to impoſe on the faithful, and by the ſame, judge them; prayſing, and approving ſuch as abſteined from the meat, they forbad them, and obſerved the dayes they had marked out to them; and condemning as guilty of a ſin, thoſe, that failed to doe the one, or the other. And the Apoſtle, a little after the Text, mocking at their pretended laws, will ſhew us the form of them. Why (ſaith he) are ye charged with Ordinances, to wit, Eat not, taſte not, touch not. And this is that, which ſhould be heedfully marked: For as concerning thoſe, who, through a certain feebleneſs of mind, did at that time ſtill ſcruple the violating of theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical diſtinctions, but however without condemning ſuch as practiſed otherwiſe, or obliging them to ſuch obſervations, as neceſſary things; thoſe the Apoſtle would have to be ſupported with patience, and ſweetnes, and he ſharply, reproves ſuch as gave them any offence. But though he hath this condeſcendency for the infirm; yet he is altogether rigid, and inexorable againſt theſe pretended teachers: who acting the Legiſlators, would put Chriſtians under their yoke; and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that ſupportance, which would have been given to their infirmity, did pretend to make others ſubject to it, and fiercely condemned thoſe, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not their traditions. It's to them, what he ſaith here, is addreſſed; <hi>Let no man condemn you; let no man judge you.</hi> And if notwithſtanding his prohibition, theſe men have the preſumption to proceed, and condemn Chriſtians for ſuch
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50919:133"/>things; it is evident, that in this caſe, he would have us deſpiſe all their judgements, their fulminations, and their anathema's; holding them themſelves worthy of condemnation, ſince they dare to make laws in the houſe of GOD; according to the inſtruction he gives the <hi>Galatians,</hi> about the ſame.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.9.</note> 
                        <hi>If any one evangelize to you beyond what you have receiv'd let him be an execration.</hi> It's thus that the Apoſtle guardeth, and fortifyeth the liberty of Chriſtians, in reference to meats, and dayes, againſt the attempts of all ſuch as would intrude to make laws in the Church about ſuch things, being indifferent in their own nature.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe theſe falſe teachers covered themſelves with the authority of <hi>Moſes;</hi> to the end that this pretext might not dazle the eyes of the ſimple, he prevents it; and granting, that ſuch diſtinctions had place yer-while in Judaiſm, by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of GOD; he ſhews, by the quality of their nature, that the uſage of them is ceaſed now under Chriſtianity. This is the ſignification of thoſe words, which he addeth for the ſecond part of the Text. The which things (ſaith he) <hi>are ſhadows of thoſe that were to come;</hi> but the body of them is in CHRIST. It is evident, he means the diſtinction of meats, the feaſts, the new Moons, and the Sabbaths, of which he had been ſpeaking, and in general, all other like things: and he ſaith that they are ſhadows of things, which were to come; not to ſignify, that they ſtill ſubſiſt of right, (on the contrary, he affirms, that they have no more place) but ſimply to declare unto us, what their nature is, and for what end they were, both inſtituted of GOD, and practiſed, during their time, by His people. He ſaith then, that they <hi>are ſhadows of things to come, of which the body is in CHRIST.</hi> A ſhadow is the repreſentation of a body, but an obſcure one, and groſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and ſuch as ſhews us meerly ſome of its lineaments, and not the lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and true form of its members. Whence it comes that this word is taken, in the Greek language, in which the Apoſtle wrote, for that which we call, a rough draught; which is a dark, and groſs painting, done only with lines, and not with the luſtre, and diverſity of colours; oppoſed to that, which they call, painting to the life. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> himſelf doth elſewhere make this oppoſition, when he ſaith, <hi>that the law had a ſhadow of good things to come,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1.</note> 
                        <hi>and not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the lively image of the things:</hi> and again, in another place, he ſtileth the law, the pattern,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5.</note> and the ſhadow of heavenly things. But here, as you ſee, he takes the word, ſhadow, properly, and not figuratively for a rough draught; oppoſing it to the body its ſelf, which it repreſenteth, and not to another kind of more expreſs, and more lively image. What then is this body, of which the legal obſervations were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows? It is (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>things to come; a body, which is of CHRIST, or in CHRIST.</hi> The things, he meaneth, were already come, and accompliſh'd, for the moſt part, at the time he wrote; foraſmuch as CHRIST, in whom they are, having been manifeſted, hath fullfilled all the myſteries of ſalvation. But the Apoſtle conſidering them as in the time, when the ſhadows were afoot under the Law calls them things to come; becauſe at that time they were indeed not come, CHRIST who was to exhibit them, being not then revealed. At that time, they were future; now they are preſent. Theſe things (my Brethren) are the Offices, and the Benefits of our LORD JESUS, and all the parts of that heavenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which He hath brought into the world. The Apoſtle therefore ſaying, that legal obſervances were ſhadows of them; doth mean, firſt, that they figured them, and referred to them; and ſecondly, that that repreſentation of them, which they afforded, was dusky, and obſcure, and groſs: that it was not a clear, diſtinct, and lively pourtrait of them: but only as it were a tricking, a naked, and ſimple delineation: ſuch as a ſhadow is in reſpect of the body, which projects it. This was one of the principal offices of the Moſaical law; even to figure out the CHRIST, that was to come. For GOD, having purpoſed, in His infinite wiſdome, for juſt, and great reaſons, not to ſend CHRIST into the world, until the laſt ages, and (as the Scripture ſpeaks) the fulneſs of time, did judge it meet, to give in the mean time, the figure, model, or deſigne of this great maſter-piece of work, in the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Firſt, for the entertaining of His people, during this time of their minority, in thoſe low, and puerile exerciſes, which ſuited with the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their age, <hi>until the revealing of CHRIST;</hi> as the Apoſtle excellently
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50919:134"/>teacheth us,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.4.</note> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> Secondly, He proceeded in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for the juſtification of His Goſpel, when it ſhould be once come. For the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and delineations of it, which we ſee in the law, do clearly ſhew us, that it is the workmanſhip, and deſignement of GOD; and the admirable reſemblance, between theſe ancient figures, long ſince drawn by His own hand in the Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and the bodies of the things, that have been revealed in JESUS CHRIST, doth irrefragably prove, that He who heretofore took the care to make thoſe draughts, is Author of the verities they repreſented; and that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth deſcend from the ſame Heaven, that at firſt, did make the ſhadows of it to be ſeen. I paſs by, for this time, the Lamb, and the Sacrifices, and the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and expiations, and all the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood; a true delineation, of our grand Victime offer'd for the ſalvation of the world, and of that eternal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which His bloud hath procured for us, and other like things, which cannot but with extreme difficulty be mainteined, nor accorded with the ways of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wiſdom of GOD, ſave by acknowledging, and receiving as veritable, what the Apoſtle doth here teach us, and is evident enough of it ſelf, namely, that all this was heretofore ordained, for the prefiguring of CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>I will only ſpeak a few words, of the diſtinction of meats, and dayes. The Apoſtle opens the myſtery of it elſewhere. For as to obſervance of meats: giving us order in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8.</note> to keep the feaſt of our Paſſoever, not with the old leaven of naughtines, and wickedneſs, but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity, and truth; doth he not clearly ſhew us, that abſtinence, from lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread, obſerv'd by the firſt people, was a Picture of the Innocence, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of the ſecond? and that by conſequence, it's to the ſame we muſt referr the diſtinction of other legal meats? the beaſts, which were forbidden them, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the characters of their natural qualities, thoſe moral imperfections, that is, thoſe vices, and corrupt affections, from which our lives ought to be exempted? As for example, abſtinence from Swines fleſh, which was an abomination to them, did ſignifie, that the people of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould have no commerce with thoſe uncleanneſſes, and ordures of deportment, wherein men of the world, notably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the genius of this animal, do wallow. And when the ſame Apoſtle telleth us, that <hi>we ſhould keep our feaſt, in truth, and ſincerity;</hi> and in another place,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4 9.</note> 
                        <hi>that there remaineth unto us a Sabbath, or a reſt;</hi> doth he not ſhew us again, that the old feaſts of Iſrael were ſhadows of ours? even of that feaſt, which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> hath procured, and appointed for the faithful, and which doth conſiſt in two things; the one, that they do abſteine from the works of ſin, and of the fleſh, the common works of men; and the other, that they do celebrate a reſt in GOD, with eternal joy? Now that the body of theſe ſhadows is in JESUS CHRIST, is evident. For innocency, ſanctity, abſtinence from ſin, joy, and immortality do well in Him fully. There it is, and no other where, that the truth, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and pattern, the doctrine, and all the cauſe of them, are to be found; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an almighty Spirit of light, which alone is capable of producing theſe divine things in every one of us. Whereby you ſee, it is ſo far from being conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, upon theſe diſtinctions having been heretofore ordeined of GOD, that we ought now to obſerve them ſtill; that on the contrary, it is to be concluded, we may inſiſt no longer on them. For ſince they were appointed, in the quality of ſhadows, until CHRIST ſhould be revealed; who ſees not, but that now when CHRIST hath been fully manifeſted, it would be meer folly in us to adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them ſtill? even as, if ſeeing, and having in hand the very body of a thing, we ſhould buſy our ſelves in following after, and embracing the ſhadow of it?</p>
                     <p>Preciſely ſuch, was the extravagancy of theſe falſe Teachers, who are here noted by <hi>S. Saul;</hi> and ſuch alſo is the errour of all thoſe, who upon the like pretences, intermedle with the impoſing of laws upon Chriſtians, concerning uſage of, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from, ſuch things, as are in their nature indifferent. And it is in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for one that our adverſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> are infinitly to blame: who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reaſon of the things themſelves, and the ſo clear doctrine of this great Apoſtle, both in this place, and in many other, have made, and conſtituted, a no leſs number of laws, about the diſtinction of dayes, and meats, then were among
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50919:134"/>the Jews themſelves. They have marked more then half of the dayes of the year, ſome with black, and others with white. I call, marked with black, thoſe, which they have devoted to the ſadneſs of faſts, and abſtinences, as all the Fridayes, and Saturdayes of the year, the Ember weeks, the Rogation-dayes, the Advent, the Eves, and Lent. I mean, by marked with white, thoſe which they conſecrate to joy, as that great throng of Holy-dayes, which they diſperſe through all the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeaſons. JESUS CHRIST, the Father of eternity, hath made His Diſciples free from the laws of time, raiſing them up above the Heavens, which do make, and meaſure it. But theſe men, put them in ſubjection to dayes, and months; and reduce them under the yoke of the Jews, and make their piety depend upon the Almanack. If they do not exactly obſerve all the dayes of the year; if they faſt not one day: if they eat not on another; if on one they don't do penance, if they make not mirth on another; though upon the former, they ſhould have cauſe to rejoyce in GOD; and upon the latter to afflict themſelves for their ſins, or their ſufferings; they commit a mortal ſin, though they did it without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or ſcandal. Was there ever a diſcipline leſs reaſonable? or more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the doctrine of <hi>S. Paul?</hi> who would not have Chriſtians condemned, for the diſtinction of a Feſtival-day, of a new Moon, or of the Sabbaths: who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the Galatians <hi>for their obſerving-dayes, and months, and times, and years;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4.11. Rom. 14 6.</note> and counts it for a weakneſs in faith, <hi>to eſteem one day above another?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither may it be replyed here, that we alſo do diſcriminate, Sundayes, and Eaſter, and Chriſtmas, and Pentecoſte. We obſerve them for orders ſake, not for Religion: for the Polity of the Church, and not upon ſcruples of devotion. For what a confuſion would there be, if we had no dayes appointed, for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of the faithful? It's for our mutual edification, and not for the worth, and value of the dayes themſelves, that we obſerve them; and (as an Ancient ſaid) <hi>not, that the day, on which we do aſſemble, is more holy, or more glorious,</hi>

If it be thus, O adverſaries, that you diſcriminate-dayes; I ſhall confeſs, I have done wrong, to accuſe you, of croſſing the doctrine of <hi>S. Paul.</hi> But who knows not, that it is a devotion for dayes; and not the profit of men, that makes you obſerve them? You believe you do GOD ſervice in this very thing, that you feaſt one day; and faſt another. You give it to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the day, and not to the neceſſity of order, or to your edification; neither do you eſteem dayes alike. Thoſe which you obſerve, you ſet up very high above others, not only by reaſon of the Church's command; but becauſe they have the honour to repreſent, and ſignify ſome myſterious thing. Accordingly you hold, that, beſides the uſe, which Feſtivals may be of for your inſtruction, and your hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time for works of piety: your very ſolemnizing of them is a Religious act, ſuch as makes up a part of Divine ſervice, and is (as you ſay) meritorious in the ſight of GOD: which is exactly the opinion, and the practice of thoſe, whom the Apoſtle, in this place, doth oppoſe. For they condemned Chriſtians, not for abſence from the aſſembly of the Church on the day appointed for it, or for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profaned ſuch howers in the world, as were deſtin'd unto the ſervice of GOD, or for having ſcandaliz'd their neighbour by this kind of fault; but only, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely (as you do) for not having celebrated a Feſtival-day.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall I ſay, of the other point, to wit, the uſe of, and abſtinence from meats? The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let no man judge you in eating.</hi> In conſcience, dare you affirm, that you judge none of the faithful in this behalf? What mean then thoſe ſo rigorous laws of yours againſt them, that eat any fleſh? thoſe laws of yours, that deprive Chriſtians of this liberty, for more then one third of the year? and condemn that man, who during all this time ſhall taſt one bit of Bief, or Mutton, to as heavy penalties, as if he had committed a deadly ſin? You are come ſo far, as you look not upon thoſe, who violate theſe fine laws, as ſinners: You

But we ſhall have ſhortly a fitter occaſion to ſpeak unto you of this ſubject more at large.</p>
                     <p>For the preſent, Beloved Brethren, make your profit, I beſeech you, of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> inſtruction. Uſe the liberty, which the LORD JESUS hath obtained for you, as His Apoſtle doth declare. It is not reaſonable, that men ſhould take from you, what GOD hath given you, and bought with the precious bloud of His Son. Only ſee,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.13.</note> that you take not this liberty for an occaſion, to live after the fleſh. Lay by ſhadows, ſince you are no longer children. But embrace the body, which is in JESUS CHRIST. His Kingdom is neither meat, nor drink; and no one will He condemn for having eaten any of the things, which he hath created for the faithful to uſe with thankſgiving. If He otherwhile prohibited ſome of them, it was to deli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ate, and figure out by this fleſhly abſtinence, that which is myſtical, and ſpiritual, whereunto He hath ſhaped you by His croſs. Your abſtinence, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, is, to renounce the meat that periſheth; to loath the paſſions, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of vice, whereon the world doth feed. It nouriſheth it's ſelf with the works of ſin. Avarice, and ambitions, and injuſtice, and luxury, and the ordures of wantoneſs, and the infamous ſweets of revenge, are the aliments it runs after, and cannot live without. This is, O ye faithful, that fleſh, the uſage whereof is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden you. This is the Lent, which JESUS CHRIST, and His Apoſtles, have in truth enjoyned; a Lent to be obſerved, not fourty dayes only, but all the year long: even that we abhorr what is evil; that we eſchew vice, as poiſon; that our lives be pure, and innocent, and clean from all the filthines of the fleſh. This is in truth that abſtinence, that makes a Chriſtian, and without which no man can have place among the members of CHRIST.

Our new Moons are the praiſe we continually ſound forth unto GOD, not with Silver-trumpets, but with heart, and underſtanding. In fine, Our Sabbath is, to do, not our own will, but the will of GOD, repreſſing, and reſtraining the motions and ſentiments of our nature, that place may be left for CHRIST to work in us, ſo as it may not be we that live; but CHRIST, who liveth in us.</p>
                     <p>This is, Chriſtians, that true body, which was repreſented heretofore, by the Jewiſh ſhadows. Theſe are your feſtivals, your ſolemnities, and your devotions. Keep them holy, and celebrate them religiouſly. It is the great Prince of your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who hath inſtituted, and conſecrated them. He recommends them to you, every where in His Goſpel; and hath indiſſolvably obliged you to them by that death of His, the remembrance of which we are to celebrate next LORD's day. If you acquit your ſelves worthily herein, be aſſured that after ſuch ſtay for a time as you make here below, He will raiſe you up to Heaven, there to celebrate with Him, and His Angels that laſt myſtical feaſt of the great day, which riſing at the point of our Reſurrection, ſhall not go down for ever; but ſhine eternally, and render us happy in the fruition of that life, and immortal glory, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us, before the foundation of the world. So be it.</p>

                     <p>DEar Brethren; It's a thing, infinitely ſtrange, and which ſhews the extream corruption of our nature, more ſenſibly, than any other, that men ſhould have ſo vehement, and invincible a paſſion for the ſerving of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. GOD the Soveraign LORD, both of them, and of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, did manifeſt Himſelf clearly to them, cauſing the illuſtrious, and glorious marks of His goodneſs, and wiſdom, and infinite power, to ſhine forth every where, above, and beneath, upon them, and about them; yea bringing the ſame home even to their hearts; and giving them a feeling of Him, by the innumerable benefits, which He poureth out continually upon all the parts of their lives; In ſhort, He ſhewed Himſelf, and drew near, and preſented Himſelf in ſo lively a manner to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
<note place="margin">Senſes.</note> and perceptions, that they could not, (if I may preſume to ſay it,) be ignorant of Him, though they would. Beſides all this, He vouchſafed to reveal Himſelf to them, at the beginning, in a particular way; ſpeaking familiarly to <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and others of the primitive Patriarchs, who were the ſources of the firſt, and ſecond world. Nevertheleſs you know, that notwithſtanding all theſe lights, the rage of that paſſion men had for Idolatry, was ſo violent, that it made them forget all theſe holy, and admirable diſcoveries of the Deity; and induced them, inſtead of their great, and abundantly good, and omnipotent Creator, bleſſed for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1.22.</note> 
                        <hi>into the reſemblance, of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed Beaſts, and creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Bruitiſh error having overwhelmed all mankind, the LORD was ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that He drew <hi>Abraham</hi> out of it, as a brand out of an univerſal Conflagration; and afterwards, manifeſting Himſelf more clearly unto his poſterity, by the miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and giving them His Law, He raiſed up amid this people a publick teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of His truth, againſt the general miſdemeanour of the world, fulminating a thouſand, and a thouſand maledictions, againſt all ſuch as ſerved Creatures. But the love of Idolatry was ſo ſtrong, as it broke this barr of Heaven, and violated this Divine declaration; which prov'd to be ſo far from reducing the Nations to their duty, as it could not keep the very Iſraelites in theirs, but they, as we learn by their Hiſtory, often gave up themſelves to the ſerving of Creatures. At laſt, after ſo many ſignifications of His mind, GOD ſent His only begotten, the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50919:136"/>and truth, into the world, who opened to us the manner and the reaſons and cauſes of the worſhipping of GOD, and did fully diſcover, that which, both the Gentiles were ignorant of, by reaſon of their ſtupidity, and the Jews did but imperfectly know, in their minority. Now who would think, that ſo ſhameful and groſs an errour, as the ſerving of creatures is, ſhould have the ſhameleſneſs to ſhew its ſelf, in ſo noble, and ſo glorious a light. Yet you know, this wretched paſſion found the means to content its ſelf; bringing in, under divers vain, but plauſible pretences, the worſhipping of Angels, and men, by little, and little, among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But however, it is not ſo ſtrange a thing, that a corruption ſhould get ſuch ground in the latter ages, when it was favoured by an univerſal ignorance, and by a decay of truth, and by the depravedneſs of men: ſuch a thing doth frequently come to paſs in their diſciplines, and conſtitutions; commonly, as they go on, they grow worſe. That, which ſurpaſſeth all admiration is, that in the time, and under the eyes of the holy Apoſtles of our LORD and Saviour, there ſhould be men found of ſo impudent a ſpirit, as to promote ſo vile an errour, in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity. We ſhould ſcarce be able to believe it, if S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not give us that teſtimony of it, which we even now read to you. And GOD permitted it, as well to exerciſe, and prove the Church, which then was, as to confirm ours; this occaſion having here drawn from the Apoſtle's pen, a clear, and magnifick condemnation of this abuſe. He hath rejected already in the precedent context, thoſe obſervances, which the falſe Teachers, he oppoſeth, had taken from the Moſaical Law; now he refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For as we ſhall ſhew anon, that ſerving of Angels, which theſe men would have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced among Chriſtians, was a fruit, and an invention of Heathen Philoſophy. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtrikes down this vain impiety in few words. <hi>Let no man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>maſter it ever you at his pleaſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>Dear Brethren: Here is a notable ſentence pronounced, which overthrows, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words, all the worſhip, that the ſuperſtition of men, whether ancient, or modern doth attribute unto creatures; it being clear, that there is not any one of them, whom we may lawfully ſerve in Religion, ſince the Apoſtle forbiddeth us to ſerve the Angels themſelves, who are without difficulty, of all creatures the moſt excellent. You know the intereſt we have in this cauſe; thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> anathma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing us in it, under colour, that content to adore and ſerve GOD our Creator, and Redeemer only, we refuſe to render unto Angels and Saints departed that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip, and thoſe Divine honours, which they decree, and deferr daily to them, to the great prejudice of the glory of GOD and the irreparable offence of men: Let us therefore exactly conſider this Oracle of the holy Apoſtles; and that we may leave nothing in it behind us, we muſt ſee firſt, what the Doctrine of thoſe Seducers is, which he condemneth. (He expreſſeth it in theſe words, <hi>Let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

But we will ſatisfie our ſelves, for this time, with the former of theſe parts, remitting the ſecond to another opportunity, by reaſon of the cavils, and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons our adverſaries make uſe of to corrupt this paſſage, which we muſt refute as briefly, as we can.</p>
                     <p>The word, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth at the entrance, and which we have tranſlated, <hi>Maſter it,</hi> is difficult, and ſeldom found in the Authors of the Greek Tongue. S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> one of the learnedſt of the ancients, ſayes,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ep. ad Alg.</hi> 9, 10.</note> it was peculiar to the Country of <hi>Cilicia;</hi> whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> was, as being born at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> the Capital City of that Provi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ice. However it be, the derivation of the word is clear, and doth ſufficiently diſcover, what is well-nigh its ſignification. For ſuch, as underſtand the Greek, do know, that this term comes from another, which ſignifies the reward, that was given to thoſe who won the victory in thoſe games, or combats for prize, at which certain Judges, and Moderators did at that time preſide, who had the ſuperintendance of the whole action, regulating and bounding the race, aſſigning the ground, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50919:137"/>receiving the Champions into it, judging of their courſes, and combats, proclaiming that man victorious to whom they yielded the advantage, and ſolemnly putting a Crown upon his head. Whence it comes that themſelves were called by a name, that ſigni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ies Givers of the reward; and the term, which ſignifies what they did on ſuch occaſions, is generally uſed to expreſs, governing, regulating, ruling, and having the ſuperintendance of a matter. It is expreſly from this term, that that which the Apoſtle uſeth here, is formed; ſaving that it ſeems to ſignifie governing, and ordering, not ſimply, but to the prejudice, and damage of the concerned. Therefore ſome have thought, that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> comparing here the Faithful unto Racers, or Combatants, as he very often doth elſewhere, does exhort them, not to let the prize, or reward of the Victory, to be taken from them by the artifice of Seducers, who made it their buſineſs, to turn them out of the true, and lawful liſts of their race, which are no other, than believing, and obeying the doctrine of the Goſpel; and make them enter into another carriere, to wit, that of their own inventions, and ſervices; in the ſame ſenſe, that he elſewhere ſaid to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who were abuſed by a like impoſture:
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.7.</note> 
                        <hi>Ye did run well, who did turn you aſide, that you ſhould not obey the truth?</hi> If this expoſition were adapted as well as to the Apoſtles phraſe, as it is to his ſenſe, it would be excellent: ſhewing us, that I may ſay it by the way, how this ſerving of Angels here forbidden us, is an error of no ſmall importance, ſince it maketh thoſe, who turn aſide unto, or employ themſelves in it, to loſe the prize of their Heavenly calling.</p>
                     <p>The Latin Interpreter, Canonized by thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> having reſpect to the effect of ſuch falſe doctrine, which is a driving of the faithful out of the right way, doth Tranſlate it ſimply. <hi>Let no man ſeduce you.</hi> There is no need to report the thoughts of all others. But I do affirm, that there can be hardly found an expreſſion more proper, more commodious, and according better with either the term or the ſcope of the Apoſtle, then that of the <hi>French</hi> Bible, <hi>Let no man maſter it over you;</hi> which doth naturally expreſs the magiſterial authority, that theſe Seducers aſſumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, enjoyning, and commanding their fancies to the faithful, as if they had been inſtalled Superintendants of their Religion, and their lives; and willing them to underſtand, that without practiſing what they preſcribed, it was not poſſible to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the prize of their high calling. Wherein the Apoſtle giveth them a blow, and renders them ridiculous, as men who having, in truth, no lawful authority, would yet make it be believed, that they had; and did ſpeak, and command with as much confidence, as if it belonged to them to diſtribute the Crown of Heaven at the laſt day; or that they had it already in their hands to impart it, to whom it ſhould ſeem them good. But that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> addeth, doth diſcover their folly much more; <hi>let no man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>maſter it over you, at his pleaſure, or at his will;</hi> which may be referred, either to their office, or to their Doctrine, or, as I think, to them both. To their Office; meaning, that they are voluntary Superintendents, and that their own will alone, not the voice of GOD, or men, did elevate them to this pretended Maſterſhip; well night as the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator calls a certain man <hi>a Voluntary Senator,</hi> who did thruſt himſelf into the rank of the Senators, but had no right to be there, having been elected only by himſelf. But this reſpects alſo their Dectrine, and ſignifies that the ſerving of Angels, which they commanded, was founded meerly on their own good-pleaſure, and not upon any precept of GOD; that their will alone, was the reaſon, and ground of it, not the will of the LORD; that it was nothing but an imagination of their own head, and a fruit either of their melancholy, or their malice. Whence we may obſerve, by the way, That thoſe, that teach in the Church, ought to ſet forth nothing, but what is founded on the word of GOD.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.20.</note> 
                        <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony; but if they ſpeak not according to this word; of a truth there ſhall be no morning for them.</hi> This rule is enough to caſhier all the doctrines of <hi>Rome</hi> which we conteſt with her. For if you examin their ſerving of Saints, and Angels, their Sacrifice of the Maſs, their Papal Monarchy, and other like opinions, you ſhall find, that they have no foundation but their will; and when they are preſſed, they go ſo far themſelves, and boldly aſſert, that they are judges of all things; judges of the faith of men, and of the Scriptures of GOD: and that a Declaration of their Popes ought to ſuffice for the reaſon of any thing;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50919:137"/>into which alſo their whole religion, and belief is finally reſolved. So as if ever there were a generation, of whom it might be ſaid, that they maſtered it over the faithful, at their pleaſure, without doubt it is they; who do call themſelves their Judges, their Lords, and their Monarchs; who make their will paſs with them, for the ſupream law of the Church; who put off to them an end leſs multitude of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and ſervices, upon the ſole credit of their good-pleaſure: and undertake to diſtribute to them the rewards of their piety, after their death, meerly according to their phantaſy, exalting ſome to be Saints, others to be Beatiſied; ordaining for ſome the ſervice of Hyperdulia, for others of ſim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe words, he ſhews us, what it is, to which they would oblige Chriſtians, namely, the ſervice of Angels; and what the pretext was, upon which they promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this new ſervice, to wit, an humility of Spirit; As for the former of theſe; the word uſed in the original, doth ſignifie, not in general all kind of ſervice, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that of Religion; whence it is, that the Latin Interpreter doth render it, the religion of Angels. This religious ſervice comprehendeth in it thoſe pieces of worſhip, and thoſe ceremonies, which are peformed to the Deity, and the actions by which homage is done it in that quality, as adoration, invocation, thankſgiving, truſt, and ſuch others. Theſe mens meaning therefore was, that beſides that ſupream ſervice, which Chriſtians do render unto GOD the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, they ſhould ſerve Angels alſo, as their Mediators, and Interceſſors with GOD, and that under this quality, they ſhould addreſs prayers, and thanſgivings, and other duties of religion to them. This was their error. The pretext they took up, to authorize this ſervice, was, an humility of ſpirit; alledging, that we are too poor a thing, to preſent our ſelves directly unto GOD, and addreſs us, by our ſelves, to ſo ſublime a Majeſty; as alſo, that JESUS CHRIST being the Son of GOD, and GOD with Him, bleſſed for ever, it would be preſumption in us to pretend the preſenting our ſelves immediately to Him: whereupon they concluded, that we muſt have recourſe to Angels, who are middle natures between GOD, and us, to the end that they receiving our prayers, may preſent them to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soveraign, and intervening with Him on our behalf, obtain acceſs for us to His, otherwiſe inacceſſible, Throne. Such was the falſe, and fair-ſeeming diſcourſe, wherewith theſe people painted over their Tradition.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon you may obſerve; firſt, in general, that the alledging of ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſeeming reaſons, is not ſufficient for the authorizing a worſhip, or an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance in religion. All that is propoſed to us in this kind, muſt be founded on the word of GOD, who alone hath the wiſdom, and the authority that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for the ſetting up of things religious. For if we once licence the mind of man, to rely upon its own imaginations, there is no error, nor extravagancy, but it will put ſome colour upon. Sure the diſcourſe of theſe Seducers doth not want ſhew; and men have found ſo much of that in it, as both Heathens, and the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which have troubled Chriſtianity, and in ſine thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> have all of them made uſe of it, to colour their Superſtitions. Yet you ſee, the Apoſtle, without ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all this vain luſtre, without vouchſafing ſo much as to examine it, does reject, and abſolutely condemn that ſervice, for which it was taken up: only becauſe ſuch ſervice was not ordained of GOD, but founded ſolely only on the will of men. Let this example make us wiſe, to abhor, and refuſe without delay, whatſoever men would introduce into religion, without the order, and the word of GOD. Let us not ſtay at all upon thoſe gaudy reaſons, wherewith they endeavour to paint over their inventions. Let us not ſo much as hearken to them. It is ſufficient warrant for our rejecting of their ſervices, that they are not ordained in the word of GOD.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50919:138"/>From hence alone it follows, that they aſſuredly are vain, and unprofitable; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any pretext, how ſpecious ſoever it be, that can or ought to authoriſe in religion, a thing that GOD hath not appointed.</p>
                     <p>Again, you ſee here in particular, that that Humility of Spirit, wherewith our adverſaries do at this day colour over, the ſervices they perform to Angels, and Saints, is but an old paint, which ancient hereticks did uſe to bad purpoſes, and the Apoſtle long ago expreſly rejects; ſo as it is not only a vanity; but a very impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for them to ſerve themſelves of a thing ſo decried. Let them ceaſe alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto us, that we are too poor to preſent our ſelves directly unto GOD; Let them forbear to lay before us the Courts of earthly Kings: where men make uſe of the mediation of Officers, before they ſpeak to the Princes themſelves; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr thereupon, that we muſt betake us to the the interceſſion of Saints, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in like manner, that they may lead us unto GOD, and preſent Him our perſons, and requeſts. S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath blaſted all this artifice; and they ſhould be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to uſe a pretext, which the firſt hereticks took up, for the covering of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; and this great Apoſtle hath manifeſtly taken from them. In very deed, all this pretended humility of ſpirit, wherewith the one, and the others mask them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is but a cover of real preſumption, which diſdaining to be ſubject to the commands of GOD, would ſerve Him after its own fantaſie, and not as He hath appointed.
<note place="margin">Iſai. 7.11, 12.</note> It's the humility of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who haughtily refuſed the grace, that the goodneſs of the LORD offered Him, upon pretence, that He would not tempt Him.

I am not ſo preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, as to go either to GOD or to His Son. I muſt beg the interceſſion of Angels, and Saints, to preſent me before that ſupream light. In conſcience, is not this an exalting of your ſelf above GOD? Is it not a preſuming, that you know better than He what belongs to your duty, and His ſervice? Is it not an hiding, under the fine words of a feigned humility, plain rebellion, and diſobedience to His Holy Majeſty? which is in effect the higheſt pride, a creature can be guilty of; ſince it is, at the bottom, a pretending, that you are wiſer than He; and that the way, He preſcribes you, is neither ſo good, nor ſo reaſonable, as that which you have choſen. But let us forbear any further arguing. For where the Apoſtle ſpeaks, there is no need, that we ſhould diſcourſe. His authority relyes not on the ſuccour of our reaſons. Here (you ſee) it is expreſs againſt our adverſaries corrupt uſage. He formerly condemns the thing they do. For they approve, and daily practiſe this ſervice of Angels, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids us: and ground it upon that ſame humility of ſpirit, the pretexture whereof He hath voided, and deſtroyed; becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubly culpable, both for rebuilding (if I may ſo ſay) this <hi>Jericho</hi> of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, which he hath domoliſhed, and for employing in it the very ſtones which he hath blaſted from Heaven. What can error ſay againſt ſo clear a determination? By what charms can it turn away this flaſh of lightning from falling on its head? Dear Brethren, it is too much in love with its own inventions, to give glory to GOD; and will rather renounce His word, than quit its ſuperſtitious imaginations.

This author then makes uſe of the word in the ſame manner.
<note place="margin">Wiſd. 4.27.</note> The abominable ſervice, ſaith he, or religion of idols, is the beginning, the cauſe, and the end of all evil.

Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, except you think, the Apoſtle ſwerved from the ſtile, wherein he wrote; the ſervice, or religion of Angels, muſt, of neceſſity, ſignifie one of thoſe two things, either the ſervice, which the Angels do perform to GOD; or the ſervice, which men perform to them. The firſt of theſe two ſenſes, cannot take place, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, of our adverſaries themſelves, and of every ſober perſon.

                     <p>Moreover, in what Prophet, in what Apoſtle, in what rational Author, either Antient, or even Modern, have theſe men ever found this novel, and extravagant manner of ſpeaking, the ſervice of Angels, that is to ſay, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> religion? Verily it is called the Law of GOD, becauſe GOD inſtituted it: the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediator, and Miniſter of it; the religion, or ſervice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe that people made profeſſion of it; the elements, or rudiments of the world, becauſe it contained but the Alphabet, and the firſt, and loweſt leſſons of piety, and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, for the moſt part, to the corporeal things of this world. But that it was ever called the religion, or ſervice of Angels, we read not. And as for that, which thoſe people do alledge, out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.

For in theſe two places, the Apoſtle does declare, only the ſervice which the Angels did to GOD, when He gave the Decalogue upon <hi>Sinai;</hi> where theſe heavenly Miniſters accompanied Him, and ordered all the Pomp of that admirable manifeſtation of His; forming the lightnings, and the thunders wherewith the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50919:139"/>Mountain did reſound; elevating in the air the ſmoke, and darkneſs, which cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, ſhaking its foundations, and making all of it to tremble, and diſtinguiſhing the thunders, into thoſe articulate words, which the mouth of GOD it ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. So far did the operation of Angels extend, and no further. For, as to the reſt, it was GOD that ſpake in His own Perſon, <hi>I am</hi> (ſaid He at the beginning, <hi>the LORD thy GOD; and that gave, and uttered all the other precepts, which the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>heard;</hi> ſo as the Law, or the religion, which He then eſtabliſhed, might well be termed the religion, or the ſervice of GOD. But it would be an evident injuring of His Majeſty, to call it the religion, or the ſervice of Angels; ſince it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven neither in their perſons, nor by their mediation Beſides, though it were otherwiſe in this particular; yet it is clear; that this title would be proper to the Decalogue only, and not reach that part of the Law which is called Ceremonial, in the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing whereof the Angels did not intervene at all, GOD having delivered it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and yet it would be this preciſely, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould underſtand here, if His purpoſe were to ſpeak of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, as our adverſaries believe. Since then this name The religion of Angels, can no way belong unto it, it muſt of neceſſity be aſſerted, that it is not the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Apoſtle means in theſe words.</p>
                     <p>But his deſign, and the thread of his diſcourſe, is no leſs oppoſite to this gloſs, than his words. For firſt, having already refuted, what the Seducers took from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the verſe immediately foregoing, in theſe words, <hi>Let no man condemn you in meat, or in drink, or in the diſtinction of feaſts, or of new Moons, or of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, which are ſhadows of things to come, whereof the body is in CHRIST;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving I ſay, ſo magnificently depoſited this, for what cauſe, or to what purpoſe ſhould he go repeating the ſame again? How ſhould the Apoſtle be capable of ſuch vain babling? Let us ſay then, that the errour, he rejects here, is diverſe from that, which he condemed juſt afore. That which he condemned afore, is the obſervation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> law, or religion: certainly then this is not the thing meant in this place. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that which he addeth, can no way refer unto it. <hi>Let no man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>maſter it over you, by humility of ſpirit, and the ſervice of Angels, intruding into things he hath not ſeen.</hi> Where the Apoſtle evidently ſheweth, that the ſervice of Angels en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Seducers, was founded upon hidden things, and ſuch as they could have no knowledge of, either by their own reaſon, or by Scripture: whereas the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies are ſo clearly, and ſo diſtinctly explained in the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that there is not a man, but may ſee them there. Laſtly, the Apoſtle ſhews us, at the beginning of this diſcourſe, that theſe Seducers had drawn ſome of their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances from <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> which will not find place, if by the ſervice of Angels, you underſtand the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> religion, which, as all know, was delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not by the Philoſophers.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50919:139"/>Heathen of his time, ſayes, They are wont to make a miſerable excauſe, ſaying, that by means of them (that is, of the petty Deities, they ſerved) they might go to GOD; as men come to a Prince, by means of His Counſellors of State, and His Maſters of Requeſts. But, ſaith he a little after, men go to a King by means of His Officers, becauſe after all a King is a man, that knoweth not whom he may truſt with His eſtate: whereas GOD is ignorant of nothing, and knoweth the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and actions, and capacity of all men: ſo as to obtain His favour, we want not the ſuffrages of an Interpoſer; there needs, but a devout ſoul. Such a one He will ſurely hear, whereſoever he ſpeaks to Him.</p>
                     <p>It's from the ſinks of this Philoſophy of the World, that the Seducers, here op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Apoſtle, had drawn their pretended humility, and their ſerving of Angels.</p>
                     <p>And our Adverſaries well perceiving, that for the main it cannot be denyed, but ſuch was the doctrine here condemned by the Apoſtle, do advance another phancy of theirs; telling us, that in his time, there was a certain Sect, which ſome call the Judaique Sect, and others otherwiſe, conſiſting of people, who neither ſerved GOD, nor JESUS CHRIST, but Angels, under the quality of Chiefs, and ſupream Patrons, and Protectors of their Religion: that it is at theſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> aimeth here, and not at them, who, its true, do ſerve Angels, but do alſo ſerve GOD the Father, and His Son JESUS CHRIST. Firſt, all this Sect is an Idol, which never had ſubſiſtence other-where, than in their fond conceit; neither could it indeed be any other where. For if they were Jews, who can believe, that they ſerved not GOD, whoſe ſervice the whole Judaical Law, and Religion did expreſly command through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end? Again, if they were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, how ſerved they not JESUS CHRIST? And if they were either Jews, or Chriſtians, how did they own no other chief of their Relgiion, then the Angels? All this is nothing, but a meer fiction of our Adverſaries, who endeavour to put a Changling upon us, and do ſet up this chymera, that it may take the blow which the Apoſtle dealeth them. It is not lawful for us to forge Sects at our pleaſure. There muſt be proof of them produced from good, and creditable witneſſes, if we would be believed about them. But ſo far are they, from having any warrant, of this fine ſtory, in Antiquity; that on the contrary, the ancient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of the Apoſtle, ſuch as <hi>Theodoret, Photius,</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,</hi> do overthrow it, affirming, that thoſe, whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> aimeth at, alledged, that GOD is great and incomprehenſible, and that it's a thing unworthy of the Majeſty of the Son, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſo mean Creatures unto Him, as men are: whereupon they added, that appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt be made to Angels, for our having acceſs by their means, and for the gaining of the favour, and good-will of GOD. How did not they ſerve GOD, ſince it was for acceſs to Him, and for the becoming gracious with Him, that they employed the Angels interceding? and how did they not adore JESUS CHRIST, ſeeing they accounted themſelves unworthy to go immediately to Him? In fine, how did they own the Angels, for the ſupream Heads of their Religion, ſeeing they made uſe of their intervention, only for to come to GOD thereby?

Now whereas they alledge, the Apoſtle's ſaying of thoſe he ſpeaks of, <hi>that they held not the head,</hi> (that is CHRIST JESUS) I grant it: But I affirm, that this doth not interr, they made profeſſion of acknowledging Him not: as from his ſaying, that they were puffed up with the ſenſe of their fleſh, and did intrude into things they had not ſeen, it follows not, that they did acknowledge, either the one, or the other of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50919:140"/>theſe things. So far were they from it, that they made profeſſion of humility, and it was under this very pretext, that they would ſerve Angels; and boaſt, without doubt, they did, of knowing well the things, that they divulged. But the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here of that, which follows truly, and ligitimatly from their doctrine, and not of what they avowed. For doubtleſs, they made profeſſion of JESUS CHRIST, and of His Goſpel, and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> doth clearly preſuppoſe it, through his whole diſcourſe. But by the addition of their errours, they denyed in effect, what they confeſſed with the mouth; and by this ſerving of Angels, took away from CHRIST the quality of being Head of the Church, which in word, they gave Him. It's this, the Apoſtle here chargeth them withall; and thereby foundeth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently this maxime, That whoſoever takes the Angels, or any other ſuch whom you will, for His Mediators, and Interceſſors with GOD, he doth in effect renounce the Mediation of JESUS CHRIST, and taketh from Him the glory He hath to be the Head of the Church. This dignity no more admitting an aſſociate, then that of His Regality; and being ſuch, as cannot be poſſeſſed, by any one alone.</p>
                     <p>But why do I ſtand conſidering, what the opinions of theſe falſe Teachers in other reſpects were? Let them have believed whatever elſe you pleaſe: ſure it is, they worſhipped Angels; and that S. <hi>Paul</hi> accuſeth them of it, and reprehends them for it; and will not have the faithful follow them in this particular. He doth not ſay, that they were Sorcerers, or Atheiſts; that they did not ſerve, or not invocate GOD, and His Son JESUS CHRIST. He ſaith, they ſerved An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and takes them up for it extream ſharply. You do the ſame. Judge then, whether the Apoſtle's Thunder does not fall on you. But you will ſay, I do adore GOD, and JESUS CHRIST. In Conſcience, do you not mock the world, in defending your ſelf after that manner? As if you were accuſed of not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Divinity of the Father, or of the Son, and not of Worſhipping Angels? But it is alwayes the cuſtome of theſe Maſters, to ſubſtitute one, or other of the Ancients in their place, when they are taken with tranſgreſſing the Ordinances of GOD, and His Apoſtles. The LORD forbids the bowing down ones ſelf before Images. They avow they do it; but for all that, do pretend, that the Law Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth againſt the Heathen of former times, and not againſt them. <hi>S. Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth, with heinous words, ſuch as enjoyn abſtinence from meats. They confeſs, it is their practice: but do add, that it is, the old Encratites, and Montaniſts, and Manichees, whom the Apoſtle means, and not they. In like manner here, being accuſed of worſhipping Angels, they franckly confeſs it, yea boaſt of Worſhipping them, and Excommunicate us, for that we do it not with them. And whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> proteſteth ſo clearly, that we muſt not ſerve them, they pay us off with this brave excuſe, that it is not of them he ſpeaks, but of I know not what old race of Jewiſh Hereticks; as if it were not manifeſt, that he ſpeaks in general of all thoſe, who at any time, and in any place whatever, do take upon them to ſerve Angels: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding us, under an heavy penalty, to let them maſter it over us, upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
                     <p>As for us, Dear Brethren, who do know, that the Laws of GOD are univerſal, and eternal; and that no Age, nor Climat can diſpenſe with men for them, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt the Violaters of them, from that righteous curſe, they threaten; let us faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obey this holy, and ſacred order which the Apoſtle hath given. Hearken we not to the vain gloſſes, and frivolous diſtinctions, by which humane ſubtilty endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to elude it, and colour over its own abuſes. Obſerve we ſincerely, what this great Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST enjoyneth us. He forbiddeth us to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Angels in point of Religion. There is no reaſon, that either the eloquence, or the ſubtilty, either the ſplendor, or the power of men, much leſs their pleaſure, and uſurped domineering, ſhould have more efficacy upon us, than this Heavenly Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And praiſed be GOD, for that He hath given us the courage to obey His Apoſtle in this particular, and to put away the Worſhipping of Angels, and men from among us, notwithſtanding the ſtrong contradiction of fleſh, and blood. Let us abide firm in this reſolution. Let us adore none, but GOD; ſince there is none adorable, but He. It's juſt, that He alone ſhould be ſerved among us; ſince it is He alone, who hath created, and redeemed us.</p>

                     <p>But, Beloved, remember, I beſeech you, that rightly to render Him His due glory, it is not ſufficient, to have renounced the errour of thoſe ancient Phrygians, whom the Apoſtle here oppoſeth, and of our Adverſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> to wit, the adoration of Angels, and men departed; There muſt alſo be baniſhing of all ſtrange ſervice, all Idolizing of any thing whatever. For if GOD cannot ſuffer thoſe, who ſerve Angels, and deceaſed Saints, that is, the moſt excellent natures that be, and ſuch as have the image of the Deity moſt clearly reſplendent in them; how much leſs will He endure thoſe, that adore Gold, and Silver, the excrements of the earth? or their own belly, the ſhamefulleſt, and moſt infamous of all idols? or the fleſh, which is but a vain, and periſhing figure; or the grandeurs of the world, which are but exhalations? And we, that have renounced the firſt fort of theſe falſe ſervices, how can we be excuſable, if we retain, and exerciſe the ſecond? Now would to GOD we were as free from the one, as we are from the other. But it muſt be confeſſed to our ſhame; theſe latter kind of Idols have ſtill a great many Devoto's, and Servitors among us. That avarice, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls an Idolatry is but too much exerciſed among us: the fleſh, and vanity are here publickly ſerved. Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, where is your judgement? You do not ſerve the Angels of Heaven, and you ſerve the mettals of the earth! You do not adore Spirits made perfect, and you do adore profane fleſh! Neither the light of the Sun, nor the brightneſs of the Moon, hath been able to ſeduce your hearts; and you have ſuffered your ſelves to be ſeduced by the glittering of Gold, and Silver, the falſe <hi>Sol,</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts! <hi>You have put your hope in Gold, and ſaid unto fine Gold, Thou art my confidence,</hi> You that have diſdained to put your confidence in Saints. The belly, (with ſhame, and horrour do I utter it) the belly is your GOD; yours, who have made this glorious promiſe, to have none but the Eternal only for your GOD? How can you hope, that the LORD ſhould ſuffer you, to give Him ſuch Monſters for compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? He, who is ſo jealous of His glory, that He cannot ſuffer the Angels themſelves to be aſſociated with Him? Dear Brethren, I pray, let us deceive our ſelves no longer. Let us once for all put clean away all theſe falſe ſervices, and exterminating every Idol from among us, adore and ſerve none but GOD alone. Let Him have the entire poſſeſſion of our whole hearts; let Him reign, and exerciſe an abſolue domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in them, governing all the ſentiments, and motions of them, at His will; that after having conſtantly adored Him in Spirit, and in truth, we may one day receive from His holy faithful hand, the Crown of Glory, and Eternity, which He hath purchaſed for us by the merit of His only Son our LORD JESUS CHRIST; To whom, with Him, and the Holy Spirit, the true, and only GOD bleſſed for ever, be honour, and praiſe unto Ages of Ages: <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>DEAR Brethren: The ſame pride, that deſtroyed the firſt man at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, is the cauſe of the ruine of ſuch of his poſterity, as do periſh. For if you heed it well, you will ſee, that that's the thing, which maketh them deſpiſe, or mis-embrace the CHRIST of GOD, in whom alone ſtands our ſalvation. It was pride, that kept the Jews from embracing this ſingular gift of Heaven; becauſe (ſaith <hi>S. John</hi>) they lov'd the praiſe of men; even as our LORD reproached them, ſaying. <hi>How can you believe, ſeeing you ſeek honour one of another?</hi> And <hi>S. Paul</hi> expreſly informs us, that the proud phancy they had, to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, was the cauſe, they ſubmitted not to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of GOD. It was likewiſe pride, that blinded the minds of the Gentiles, ſo as they ſaw not the wonderful things of the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST. The haughty opinion they had of their own vain wiſdome, induced them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the wiſdom of GOD; and to account the Croſs of His Son fooliſhneſs, though it be an inexhauſtible treaſury of ſapience. Again, in fine it is pride, that hath ſeminated, among Chriſtians themſelves, all the hereſies, that have grown up into any requeſt, ſince the Churches nativity to this hour. Ignorance animated with preſumption hath brought them all forth, and bred them up. For if the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py workers that divulged them, had kept to the doctrine of GOD, and not laſh'd out beyond what He hath revealed in His word: if the vain fierceneſs of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, had not emboldned them, to enterpriſe things above the reach of men; they would never have thought upon corrupting Religion, with their falſly-ſubtil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. It would have remained pure throughout, and ſincere to this day; and ſuch, as the Miniſters of our LORD, and Saviour deliver'd it at firſt to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by word, and writing. But their pride miſ-leading them, did induce them, to attempt things above their capacity, and adore, and ſpread abroad their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous imaginations, as true ſecrets of GOD.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle informs us, in this Text, that this was the origine, in particular, of thoſe errors, and falſe ſervices, which certain Seducers went about to introduce, at that time among Chriſtians. We heard, in the laſt exerciſe upon this ſubject, what their errour was: namely, that under colour of a falſe humility of Spirit, they taught the ſervice, or Religious worſhip of Angels. We are now to conſider, by the aſſiſtance of GOD, that which the ſhortneſs of time hindered us from expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating then; to wit the marks of theſe falſe Teachers, and the pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:50919:141"/>of their errour. For though the Apoſtles intimation of the thing it ſelf be ſufficient; His authority in the Church being ſuch, as it is not lawful for any man, whoever he be, to teach, or believe any thing in Chriſtian Religion, contrary to the ſentiment of this great ſervant of GOD: Yet not content with injoyning the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians,</hi> that they ſhould not let themſelves be maſter'd over by theſe pretended Doctors, who would cauſe them to ſerve Angels; for the adding of more weight to his exhortation, he diſcovers to them thoſe Seducers their true motives, and the cauſe of their errour, and remonſtrates alſo the diſmal iſſue, in which it did engage them. For, as you have heard, he noteth firſt their audaciouſneſs, and ignorance, when he ſaith that, <hi>they intrude into things they have not ſeen.</hi> Next, he ſhews the ſource of them, to wit, their fooliſh preſumption, when he adds, <hi>that they are raſhly puffed up with the ſenſe of their fleſh:</hi> And laſtly, he repreſents us the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious conſequence of their doctrine; the fruit, and ſucceſs wherein all their ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did terminate; which was, that in effect, by their glorious ſervices, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, and diſunited men from JESUS CHRIST the true, and only Head of believers, and ſo depriv'd them of that life, that light, and ſalvation, which this Divine Head influxeth into the members of His myſtical body. For this is, in ſubſtance, the ſenſe of the latter part of the Text, in which the Apoſtle ſaith, that theſe people <hi>did not hold the head, from which the whole body being furniſhed, and fitly knit together by joints, and bands encreaſeth with the encreaſe of GOD.</hi> In theſe three heads, the whole meaning of this Text ſeems to me to conſiſt. Wherefore, if it pleaſe GOD, we will examin them diſtinctly one after another: and, in the Apoſtles order, treat firſt of theſe Seducers boldneſs: ſecondly of their preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and laſtly of the conſequence of their doctrine, which tendeth to the diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of men from JESUS CHRIST, the Head of the whole body of the Church.</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt point; this temerity, to intrude into things one hath not ſeen, is ordinary enough, with all ſorts of men, ever ſince the venom of pride impoiſoned their hearts, and in ſpecial, with all hereticks; But it is remarkable particularly in thoſe, that teach the ſervice of Angels; it being manifeſt, that thoſe bleſſed Spirits, whoſe worſhip they erect, are of a nature much ſuperior to us, the order, and operations whereof are open to no ſenſe of ours. But when the Apoſtle ſaith, they have not ſeen the things into which they intrude, his meaning is not ſimply, that the eyes either of their body or of their natural reaſon, never received the Species of theſe objects; nor apprehended, or conceived the conſequences, and conduct of their being; but moreover, that they neither had, nor could have by the word, or revelation of GOD, any certainty of the things they affirmed. For though the greater part of the matters of Religion be above our ſenſes; yet when GOD hath diſcover'd them to us, and as it were, rendered them viſible in His word, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes eaſie for us to know them by this means; and the Scripture too doth call the knowledge, that we have of them this way, a ſight of them.
<note place="margin">Ezek. 13.3.</note> Thus <hi>Ezekiel</hi> means, when he reprocheth the falſe Prophets, with following their own hearts, when they had ſeen nothing; that is, they predicted, and aſſured things for true, which the fooliſh imagination of their own Spirit ſuggeſted to them, though in truth, GOD had ſhewed them no ſuch matter, in the light of His revelation. It is juſt ſo, that thoſe Seducers did, whom the Apoſtle taxeth in this place. They dogmatized, and affirmed it, as a clear caſe, that Angels were to be ſerv'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated: and to perſwade men of it, they delivered many things, concerning their nature, and their intervention between GOD and us. Yet the truth is, that of all this, they neither had, nor could have any certainty, as being things, which they had never ſeen either in the School of nature, or the revelation of GOD.</p>
                     <p>All our knowledge, and aſſurance neceſſarily comes from one of theſe three ſources, namely, either from ſenſe, and ſuch is the knowlege we have of the things we ſee, hear, ſmell, touch and taſte; or from reaſon; and ſo doth humane ſcience, which is acquired, or formed, by diſcourſe, and natural reaſoning; or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the revelation of GOD, who diſcovereth to us, by the light of His word, divers objects, and divers verities, which neither our ſenſe, nor our reaſon, could perceive in nature. Now though reaſon doth cauſe men, by the conſideration of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50919:142"/>things that are, or are done in the world, to diſcern ſome principles, and verities of Religion; yet the whole of this is ſo ſmall a matter, and withal ſo confuſed, and imperfect, by reaſon of the corruption of our underſtandings, that the Word of GOD ought to be held, for the ſole aſſured foundation of Religion; according to that which the Apoſtle ſignifies to us elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.1</note> even that <hi>faith cometh by hearing, and hearing from the word of GOD.</hi> When therefore he ſaith here, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers do intrude into things they have not ſeen, he doth, it's true, reſpect in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral all thoſe Sources of our knowledge, and abſolutely deny, that theſe men had, by them, any of the things they dogmatized: but he does particularly referr to the third, that is, the revelation of GOD. And his meaning is, that the LORD had not ſhewed them, nor made them ſee, by His Word, any of the things they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and would ſet up in the Religion of Chriſtians. And though indeed they neither had, nor could have any certain knowledge of them; nevertheleſs they diſcours'd of them blindfold; and did divulge their phantaſies, the viſions of their brain, and dreams of their own Spirit, for indubitable, neceſſary, and wholeſome truths.</p>
                     <p>A carriage, which the Apoſtle doth excellently well ſet forth, by that word of his, which we have tranſlated, intruding; a word, that properly ſignifies entring into, ſetting foot on, and marching forth in ſome quarter, as in ground we have title to. Whereby he noteth out the vanity of theſe falſe Teachers, who did not meerly buſie themſelves in a reſearch of things above their capacity, (which is in it ſelf a vain, and ridiculous labour) but alſo dared to ſpeak of them, and make peremptory deciſions about them: ſo, going above ground, and walking, as may be ſaid in the <hi>vacuum</hi> of their own imaginations: mounting their thoughts unto a Region far above them; like that poor Phrenetick, of whom the Poets ſpeak, who having preſumed to enter upon a ſtrange Element, and fly there, ſoon found his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs puniſhed with his ruine. The Prophet makes uſe of a like phraſe, when to repreſent his modeſty,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 131.1.</note> he ſaith, that <hi>he hath not walked in great things, and too high for him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Dear Brethren, we have no need, to aſcend ſo far back as the Apoſtle's time, for examples of this vanity. Our Adverſaries of the Communion of <hi>Rome,</hi> do afford us a ſufficient ſtore: who, as they retain the errour of thoſe, whom the Apoſtle here taxeth, ſerving Angels, as they did: ſo do inherit their temerity, intruding into things, they have not ſeen. They do magiſterially pronounce, that men muſt ſerve, and invoke Angels, and Saints departed. They boldly define the Religious Worſhip, that is to be given, and divide it us into its kinds; naming one of them <hi>Dulia,</hi> and the other, <hi>Hyperdulia;</hi> all with as much confidence, as if they ſpake of things moſt obvious to ſence. I urge not, for the preſent, that Scripture doth blaſt this whole errour, every where intimating, that we ought to ſerve no one in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but GOD alone, and with loud voice anathematizing the Worſhip of any creature. I pretermit, what it ſaith particularly, againſt the Adoration, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Angels; as alſo, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth expreſly prohibit it in the Text. I keep ſingly to the rule, he here gives me; that no belief be afforded thoſe, who intrude into things, they have not ſeen; and do demand of theſe hardy Doctors, in what Region, in what part of Divine Revelation, have they ſeen theſe Services, theſe <hi>Dulia's,</hi> and theſe <hi>Hyperdulia's,</hi> of which they ſo poſitively ſpeak? Where is it, that the Holy Ghoſt hath ſhewed them theſe brave Doctrines? To what Prophet hath He revealed them? To what Apoſtle hath He ſignified them? Of what Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt have themſelves learnt them? Sure they muſt here be huſht, of neceſſity. They have not ſeen one of theſe pretended myſteries, in the Book of GOD. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhew us any track of them any where, except it be in the fancies of <hi>Plato,</hi> and of the Heathen Philoſophers, the Diſciples of <hi>Daemons,</hi> and not of GOD; men taught in the School of errour, and not in that of truth. They proceed further yet, and make us diſcourſes about the Orders of Angels, and diſtribute to them their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and cut them out their Miniſtrations; they rank the Saints, and give to them, each his Charge, and employment. And if you ask them, how theſe Spirits, being in Heaven, do hear our Prayers and requeſts; and by what means they ſee the ſecret motions of our hearts; They anſwer, ſome of them, that the mirrour of the Trinity,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50919:142"/>upon which they inceſſantly have their eyes, doth preſent them, all the Idea's of them; others, that GOD reveals them to them, ſome other way. But whence do they know this? It is neither ſenſe, nor natural reaſon, that hath ſhewed it them. If therefore they have ſeen it any where, it muſt be in the Revelation of GOD. Yet it is clear, and they cannot deny it, that neither this pretended mirrour, nor any one of their other conjectures, do appear there at all.

                     <p>This vanity doth further ſhew it ſelf, in the things they give out, concerning the ſtate of Souls, in their fabulous Purgatory, the ſcituation, the ſtructure, and partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereof they repreſent; together with the fire, and torments of the Spirits, that are there impriſoned, with ſuch a deal of confidence, as if they were juſt now come from thence, after many years ſtay in the place. Nevertheleſs, the truth is, that neither they nor their Anceſtors euer ſaw one jot of it, either in the Scriptures of GOD, or in the nature of things; there being not a word any where, of any one of theſe imaginations. That which they ſay, of their Tranſubſtantiation, with its conditions, and circumſtances, and of the manner how the body of CHRIST is preſent in every crumb of their Hoſte, and in every drop of their Chalice. Their poſitions likewiſe, concerning their pretended Sacrifice of the Maſs, and concerning the relative, or Analogical adoration of Images, and concerning the Characters, which ſome of their Sacraments do imprint upon the ſouls of men; and in one word, all the points of doctrine, that we conteſt with them, are of the ſame nature; All of them are things, they have not ſeen; they intrude into them; walk in them, and ſtrout vainly; commanding the belief or practice of them, under pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, how doubtful, and uncertain ſoever they be, and furiouſly anathematizing all thoſe, who make the leaſt doubt to receive them.</p>
                     <p>As for us, Dear Brethren, who, through the grace of GOD, have learned to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr His voice before the imaginations of men, and to fear the thundrings of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, more than the fulminations of <hi>Rome,</hi> let us leave them in this vain humour; or to ſay better, pray to GOD, to bring them out of it, and give them to diſtinguiſh their own dreams, from His declarations. And for our further acquitting of our ſelves, let us religiouſly keep to the Apoſtles direction. Intrude we never into things, we have not ſeen. Neither be ſo ſimple, as to follow thoſe that do, or to ſuffer our ſelves to be maſtered over, by them. Let us reſt in the things which GOD hath clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us in His word; which He hath ſo ſet before our eyes, in that Divine Treaſury of His truth, as very children may there behold them. This portion is ſufficient for us; if we cultivate it well, we ſhall find in it abundantly, wherewith to inform our underſtandings, wherewith to calm our Conſciences, and ſanctifie our hearts, and perfect all the faculties of our ſouls. <hi>Let no man preſume above that which is written.</hi>

And when we conſider, not barely what each ſingle perſon of us knows, but all the Science that all mankind hath acquired, during ſo many ages, as its greateſt, and moſt accompliſhed wits have been buſied about it; we find, that its ſo little in compariſon of what we are ignorant of, that a drop of water hath more proportion to the whole Ocean. It's therefore without doubt a vanity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly fooliſh, to make oftentation of it, and to preſume much of a man's ſelf, for ſo ſmall an advantage. But it is a much worſe extravancy yet, to take this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the fleſh for our guide in matters of Religion, which are all of them divine, and coeleſtial; while it is incapable of conducting us in the very things of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of the earth, as experience lets us daily ſee; ſo as we muſt conclude, that all thoſe, who laying by the Word of GOD, would inſtruct us in Religion by the light of their own underſtandings, are all of them taken with as high degree of ſenſleſneſs, as ever was: and that beſide vanity, there is phrenſie in what they do, and ſome ſuch bruitiſhneſs, as thoſe mad people ſhewed, who yet while would raiſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ducers that ever roſe up in the world. Accordingly you ſee, that the Apoſtle, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> doth enroll Hereſie among the works of the Fleſh: becauſe it is a production of its underſtanding, which incitated, and heated by the preſumptuouſneſs thereof, doth bring forth this wretched brood. And it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50919:143"/>that theſe ſame Seducers, whoſe puffing up, and pride the Apoſtle here diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, did notwithſtanding make profeſſion of <hi>humility of ſpirit,</hi> as he himſelf doth teſtifie; to ſhew us, that we ſhould not rely upon apparencies; and that oftentimes under the habit, and looks, and outward actions of humbleneſs, there are hidden, hearts puffed up with vanity, and ſwoln with pride. And ſuch is at the bottom the Genius of all thoſe, that would have their inventions to be valid in Religion. Their very having the audaciouſneſs to exceed the inſtitutions of GOD, doth evidence an inſufferable arrogance; foraſmuch as inſtead of being content with His Orders, and ſubmitting to them with an humble, and teachable ſpirit, they undertake to cut out new wayes to Heaven. I leave now to each one the care of applying this obſervation to thoſe new rules, which the ſpirit of ſuperſtition hath multiplyed, for divers Ages, almoſt to an infinity. They all ſet the Croſs over their Gates; the ſervices they perform to Angels, and men; the habits they ſhape for their zealous; their countenances, and their very looks, and eyes ever fixed on the ground, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a profound humility. But GOD knoweth what the reality is. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the dijudication of it unto Him. I only advertiſe you, that you ſhould not ſuffer ſuch fair outſides, to abuſe you; remembring, how the Apoſtle hath here taught us, that a profeſſion of humility of ſpirit, doth ſometimes cover, a foul raſhly puffed up with the ſenſe of its fleſh: as alſo, that not ſeldom, this very humility, and pretended mortification, is the matter, which feedeth its pride, and maintaineth its flatulency.</p>
                     <p>But it is time, to come to the third point; which containeth the worſt, and moſt pernicious effect of this ſerving of Angels, here condemned by the Apoſtle; namely, that they that promote it, or ſtick in, and practiſe is, <hi>do not hold the head, from which the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ſe again for the ſalvation of the world:</hi> and that the body of this head, is the Church; the whole multitude of the faithful. This comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>riſon is ſo frequent in Scripture, and the reaſons, upon which it is founded, are ſo clear, and ſo known, that there is no need I ſhould ſtand upon deducing them. We have to obſerve, only, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this divine head upon the body, and the benefits it communicates thereto, both which the Apoſtle toucheth at. He ſaith firſt, that this Head furniſheth the body of His Church. Then in the ſecond place, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>tly knits the ſame toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by joynts, and bands. And laſtly, that by this means, He makes it to encreaſe with an encreaſe of GOD. All this is taken from the reſemblance of natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whence this compariſon is drawn. For you ſee, that in nature, the head does firſt, diſtribute to all the parts of the body, ſuch ſtrength as is neceſſary for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing of their motions, and ſenſations; it being as it were the common Source, whence the animal ſpirits as they are called, the principles of motion, and ſenſation; are by the nerves, as by ſo many Channels, ſhed forth into all the parts of the whole frame, as well higher, as lower, the fartheſt off, as well as the neareſt; and when this influence, and communication of the head happens to ceaſe, you ſee the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which are deprived of it, to be preſently paralytick and inſenſible. Then further, the head does the body this office, that it binds, and keeps decently faſtned to each other, by means of the ſame nerves, all the parts whereof it is made up, both the harder ones, as the Bones, and Cartilages; and likewiſe the ſofter, as the Muſcles, and other ſubſtances. Finally, the Head, by means of this continual influence, doth give its body the ability to grow, and extend its ſelf, and riſe up by little, and little, to the meaſure of its due magnitude. The Apoſtle therefore makes uſe of this natural image, for the repreſenting unto us of thoſe ſpiritual benefits, which we receive from the communion of the LORD JESUS, our myſtical Head, and ſayes, Firſt, that He furniſheth His body, that is, gives it abundantly, ſpiritual ſenſe, and motion; and in a word, all graces neceſſary for the exerciſe of an Heavenly life, diffuſing them into all His myſtical members, that is, into all the faithful, by means of his not animal, as that of nature is, but Divine, and Eternal Spirit. This Spirit, which He diſtributes to all, and every of His members, doth repleniſh our eyes, and ſenſes, with that light, and vigour, which is requiſite, for the ſeeing, feeling, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50919:144"/>taſting of Divine things: It ſheds abroad peace, and joy into our hearts, and curing our benummed limbs, and opening our hands which vice had locked up, doth give us the operations, and motions of the life of GOD, and in fine, formeth in us all the conceptions, and vertues of the new man.</p>
                     <p>But he ſaith in the ſecond place, continuing this excellent Metaphor, that this Divine Head doth fitly knit together His body by joints and bands; expreſſing by theſe words, that ſpiritual Union, which bindeth, and joyneth the faithful, all of them to their Head, and each of them to the other. For as every member of the body hath its particular temperature, and qualities, very different from the reſt, one being hard, another ſoft; one cold, another hot; one dry, another moiſt; and yet being linked by thoſe ſecret, and unperceptible bands, which deſcending from the head, do faſten them all together, do make up but one only, and the ſame body: ſo is it with the Church: The faithful, of whom it is compoſed, are upon the account, both of nature, and of grace infinitely different, one from another. In nature: for ſome are of one Nation, of one Age, of one Sex, of one condition; and others of another; one rich, another poor; one learned, another ignorant; one noble, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of low extraction. In grace likewiſe; for who can utter all the differences of their gifts in this reſpect? But JESUS CHRIST, their myſtical Head, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this diverſity, reduceth them all into one, and the ſame body: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith elſewhere, <hi>We being many are one body in CHRIST:</hi> He ſets us together, and uniteth us aptly, one with another, by theſe myſtical joynts and bands of which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks: that is, the gifts and graces of His Spirit; and firſt of all, Charity, the univeral bond of all the faithful, which ties them inſeparably together, by the ſentiments of a ſincere, and ardent love, and by all the motions, offices, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and aſſiſtances, which depend upon it. It's this Spirit of Charity, that mixeth all their ſouls into one; that renders them ſenſible of each others weal, and wo; that inſpires into them the ſame Prayers, and wiſhes, and ſo governs their actions, that though different, they yet all aim at the ſame mark, the glory of their Head, and the common edification of His members. Among theſe joynts, and ligaments of the LORD's body, I alſo place, the divers graces, wherewith He doth inveſt them, giving to this man one Talent, and to that man another, different; to one, zeal; to another, knowledge; to one utterance, to another judgement. To the ſame too muſt be referred, the divers offices, which He hath inſtituted in His Church, Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, and Deacons; this various diſtribution approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating them to one another; the need, they have, of their Brethren, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour they may afford them, admirably knitting, and keeping up the commerce of their common Charity,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.12.</note> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly noteth in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> where ſpeaking of the divers Miniſtries, which the LORD JESUS formed, and erected among His people, he ſaith, that He made them for the coaptation, or ſetting together of the Saints, for the edification of His body.</p>
                     <p>In fine, he addeth here, a third benefit of CHRIST's, which is as the ſequel, and fruit of the two former; that His body thus furniſhed, and compacted by its Head, doth encreaſe with an increaſe of GOD, that is, with a Divine, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual increaſe, ariſing from the efficacy of GOD, and tending to His glory; in as much as the Church, thus united to its Head, and filled with the influences of His grace, is eſtabliſhed, is ſtrengthened, and compleated by little, and little, in faith, in hope, in charity, in light, and in ſanctity, untill it attain, unto the meaſure of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtature, in CHRIST. Such is the Communion of the Church with its Head JESUS CHRIST, here deſcribed by the Apoſtle.</p>
                     <p>And hence it appears, how grievous the errour of thoſe is, who ſerve Angels there, being not any thing in theſe words, but does evince it. Firſt then the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>they hold not the head.</hi> 'Tis true, they do not make profeſſion of letting it go. For they affirm themſelves Chriſtians, and do own JESUS CHRIST, for the Prince, and Author of their Religion. But at the bottom, and in effect, they break the union, which they ſhould have with Him, in quality of Head; ſince they addreſs themſelves to Angels, as their Mediators, and Interceſſors with GOD. For it's a giving them the office of Head, which pertains to one alone; it being clear, that this mediation, which is the Source of our life, is the office of our Head. Again their
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50919:144"/>impudence doth plainly appear, in that JESUS CHRIST our Head, doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh His body with all neceſſary graces. For to what end ſhould we go ſeek in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or Saints, what we have abundantly in JESUS CHRIST? Is there any grace, any light, any bleſſing, which we may not have from Him? Nay, (ſaith the Apoſtle) it is he that furniſheth the whole body. He is the fulneſs of grace, an inexhauſtible abyſs of good. Sure then, it's extream vanity, to addreſs our ſelves to any other; and to ſeek the waters of life, and of ſalvation, in petty by-ſtreams, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in that ſo full, ſo freſh, and ſo abundant an only Source, which the Father hath given us, in this Divine Head. Though the ſerving of Angels, and Saints were permitted, (which yet it is not) however, 'tis evident, it would be unprofitable, ſince we moſt aſſuredly have, in JESUS CHRIST alone, all the ſuccour, and aſſiſtance, we can poſſibly pretend to, from thoſe creatures.</p>
                     <p>But that which the Apoſtle adds, in the ſecond place, to wit, that this Divine Head doth compact, and knit together His whole body, doth further potently oppoſe this error, which divides the Church and brings a very manifeſt odd variety into its Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; for that it multiplyeth the objects of its devotion, cauſing ſome to ſerve one Angel, or one Saint, and others another: ſome have a devotion for one, and call themſelves after him, and others adhere to another; as you plainly ſee by the example of thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> who are divided, into divers bands, and fraternities, according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the Male, and Female Saints, to whom they engage their devotion: not to ſay, how each of them hath a particular ſervice, for his Angel guardian, differing from the ſervice of all others by reaſon of its object; foraſmuch as according to them, every one hath his particular Angel, different from thoſe of others. Whereas the true body of CHRIST is all knit together in a perfect union, having but one only head JESUS CHRIST, and one only religious ſervice, one and the ſame faith, and one and the ſame Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the Apoſtle yet again ſtrikes, at the Authors of this errour, when he ſaith, that the body of the Church, being united, guided, and governed by its Head JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, increaſeth with an increaſe of GOD. For theſe people are wont to vaunt of perfecting, and increaſing the Religion of Chriſtians, by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch ſervices, as they invent. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, that this is not the increaſe, that the Church receives; which muſt be an increaſe of GOD; an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and advancement in things, which He hath commanded, an inſtituted; whereas theſe people do grow only in the traditions of men, and inventions of the fleſh, which add nothing to the true, and legitimate magnitude of the body: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes by them, more blown up, not fuller; more deformed, not greater. They are like warts, and wolfes, and empoſtumes, which disfigure, and incommodate the body; but are far from enriching, or perfecting it.</p>
                     <p>Dear Brethren, let us lay by, all theſe ſtrange doctrines. Let us hold faſt to this Holy, and bleſſed Head, JESUS, the Son of GOD, who hath vouchſafed to take us for His body. Let us enjoy, with awfulleſt reſpect, the great honour, He hath therein done us. Be not we, ſo ingrateful, or ſo unadviſed, as to give that glory to any other, which belongs to Him alone. Let vain men ſubmit to other heads; let them profane this Divine quality of Head of the Church, attributing it, either to Angels, or (which is yet worſe) to a mortal man. For our parts, O LORD JESUS, we neither have, nor ever will have, other head than Thee. As it is Thou alone, that haſt redeemed us, formed, and aſſociated us in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thy body: So never will we addreſs our Devotions, our Religion, our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and invocations to any, but to Thee. It's on Thee alone, that we will live, and of thy ſprings alone, that we will draw. Likewiſe with Thee are the words of Eternal life. To what Saint beſides ſhould we go? Without Thee, we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and in Thee alone we can do all things. Beloved Brethren, this is the Vow, which I now preſent to the LORD JESUS, in the behalf of us all, and I aſſure my ſelf there is not one of you, but heartily ſayes Amen thereto. It remaineth, that we do faithfully acquit our ſelves of this great vow, rendring up our ſelves to be guided, and governed by the LORD JESUS CHRIST, ſince He is our Head; having no motion, nor ſentiment, but what deſcends from Him; and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into our Nerves, and Arteries His Coeleſtial, and divine Spirit; ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50919:145"/>the ſpirit of the Fleſh, and of the Earth, which animates the world. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that you are the body of CHRIST, and live in ſuch a pureneſs, as may be worthy of ſo great a name. Above all, let us have thoſe Sacred bonds between us, which do fitly knit all the members of our LORD together: that is to ſay, the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a vigorus Charity, communicating readily, and chearfully to one another, the graces, which our common Head hath furniſhed us with, for our mutual edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the rich, their alms, to thoſe that are poor; the knowing, their inſtructions, to the ignorant; the ſtrong, their ſuccour to the weak; thoſe that are in proſperity, their Conſolations, to the afflicted; encreaſing all of us continually with an increaſe of GOD, in Faith, and Sanctification, and advancing daily ſome paces towards the mark, and prize of our ſupernal Calling. This is the Diſcipline of the LORD JESUS. This is that, He hath commanded us, His Apoſtles Preached, and left in their Writings, to us; not the ſerving of Angels, and other ſuch inventions of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, of which thoſe holy men ſay not one Word, except it be to refute, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them. Reſt we in their Doctrine, and we ſhall have part in their bliſs, through the grace of JESUS CHRIST, their Head, and ours. <hi>To whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Holy Spirit, the only true GOD, bleſſed for ever, be honour, praiſe, and glory to Ages of Ages.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>DEar Brethren; Seeing the Apoſtle plainly ſheweth, in diverſe places, that the uſe of meats is a thing indifferent, and that if we eat,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.8.</note> we have not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more; nor the leſs, if we eat not; and even injoyneth us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to accommodate our ſelves to the infirmity of our brethren,
<note place="margin">Rom. 14.21.</note> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that <hi>it is good, neither to eat fleſh, nor to drink wine, nor to do any thing, whereby our brother ſtumbleth, or is offended, or made weak;</hi> it may ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that in this Epiſtle, and in the firſt to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and elſewhere, he doth ſo earneſtly inſiſt upon this point, and employ ſo many words, and reaſons againſt thoſe, who did prohibit certain ſorts of meats to Chriſtians. But if you through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider this holy man his whole procedure, and the motives of his taking ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, you will find it full, in all the parts thereof, of reaſon, and profound diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For firſt, there is a great difference, between ſuch, as he bears with, and thoſe whom he rejects. The one were infirm, and the other inſolent. The former through want of knowledge, could hardly count thoſe things permitted, which the School of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whence they were but newly come forth, had prohibited. The latter, did in their headineſs, enterpriſe the bringing of Chriſtians under the yoke again. The errour of thoſe, reached no further, than their own perſons. Theſe would dogmatize, and give the Church new Laws. Wherefore the Apoſtle is ſweet towards the one, and ſevere againſt the others, according to the difference of their faults. And as to the thing it ſelf, though it be no more a crime, to abſtain from, than it is to eat, any of the meats, which GOD hath created for our uſe; yet to make this abſtinence paſs, for a matter of neceſſity, is a penicious attempt. Firſt, it's an overthrowing, or a diminiſhing of our liberty, which having been purchaſed, by the blood of CHRIST, ought to be very precious to us; for ſince He would buy it us, at ſo high a price, it is not juſt, that the fancy, or the tyrannicall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of men, ſhould bereave us of a thing, that coſt him ſo dear. Moreover ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions do make, that to be thought neceſſary, which is indifferent; and that, to paſs for a part of the ſervice of GOD; which is not ſo; An opinion, which hath dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequences. For men, once poſſeſſed, with this imagination, do, in ſuch exerciſes, looſe, a good part of their time, which ſhould be wholy ſpent in the ſtudy, and practice of the true commandments of our LORD JESUS. But, which is yet worſe, they eaſily imagine, that they get, a licence to commit things prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50919:146"/>without danger, by ſuch abſtaining from things permitted, and the priviledge of being diſpenſed with for obedience to GOD, by that they render unto men; a conceit, which as you ſee, does undermine the foundations of that true, and real ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, without which no man ſhall ſee GOD.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle well-knowing therefore, the venom of theſe doctrines, and ſeeing, on the other hand, the ſtrong inclination, that men have to them; being likewiſe not ignorant, (as experience hath but too much verified,) that there would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies people ſound, to ſet them on foot among Chriſtians; did account it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the ſecuring of our faith, to give us, in diverſe places of His divine Epiſtles, ſtrong Preſervatives againſt the Contagion of this pernicious error. You have heard already heretofore, how he ſaid concerning it, <hi>Let no man condemn you in cating, or in drinking,</hi> irrecoverably overbearing, by thoſe few words, the temerity of all thoſe, who for ſuch things, bring the faithful to the Bar; and condemn them to the fire of Hell, for having but taſted of meats, which they prohibit. He now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the ſame diſcourſe, and having, in the two precedent verſes, refuted the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Angels, which the Seducers did ſet up in religion, he comes to their other Ordinances, which concerned certain abſtinences, and devotions, that they impoſed on Chriſtians, as ſalutiferous, and of neceſſary uſe for humbling the ſpirit, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the fleſh; and firſt he refutes them by three excellent reaſons, which he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth againſt them, next, he rejects the vain, and ſpecious pretexts, under colour of of which they were recommended. The firſt of thoſe three reaſons, which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth, againſt theſe pretended devotions, is taken from the liberty, which JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST hath purchaſed for us, by His death, freeing us from all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and ceremonial ſervices. <hi>If therefore ye be dead with CHRIST,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>why doth any one burthen you with ordinances, as if you lived in the world, to wit, Eat not, Taſt not, Touch not.</hi> The ſecond is drawn from the nature of thoſe things themſelves from which an abſtaining was ordered; <hi>they all are things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that periſh in the uſing.</hi> And the third, from the riſe of ſuch ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, inſtituted, not by the authority of GOD, but after the commandments, and doctrines of men. Theſe are the three points, we purpoſe to treat of in this action, by the aſſiſtance of GOD; beſeeching Him to grant, that we may medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them, to our common Edification, and Conſolation.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtles laſt words were, concerning the communion of the Church, with JESUS CHRIST its head, who furniſheth His whole body, and fitly knitteth it together by joynts, and bands, cauſing it to increaſe, with an increaſe of GOD. Hereupon, he takes occaſion, to ſet before us again, that enfranchiſement from the yoke of Ceremonies which we have by this holy, and myſtical communion with our LORD. That is his meaning in theſe words, <hi>we are dead with CHRIST, as to the rudiments of the world.</hi> For (as we have ſhewed afore) the Apoſtle does uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally call the Ceremonial ordinances of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, the elements, or rudiments of the world: becauſe they were the firſt, and loweſt leſſons of GOD's people, ſtanding all of them in material, and worldly things, and in the uſage of, or in an abſtinence from, either elements, or plants, and animals, and other fruits, and productions of the world. But he ſeems in this place, to ſignifie, by theſe words, generally all ſervices of this nature, whether thoſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſometime inſtituted, for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the childhood, and minority of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> or thoſe that other men erected af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: of which ſort, were the devotions, and ceremonies, which the Elders of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> added to the Law, and made to paſs for traditions of antiquity, as we underſtand by the Goſpel, where our Saviour notes them, and very ſharply reproves them, in diverſe places. Such again were the diſciplines, and devotions of thoſe Seducers, whom the Apoſtle here oppoſeth; and all other like them, which though ſet up by diverſe authors, and at different times, yet joyntly conſiſt in one and the ſame kind of terrene, and material things, and tend to one, and the ſame end, to wit, the purifying, and ſanctifying of men, and the rendring the Deity propitious, and favourable to them, by ſuch exerciſes. This whole ſort of ſervice, is carnal, tyed up to certain corporeal things, and actions, in which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, as is meat, and drink, in watchings, and cloathing; in mens waſhing, and diſcipling themſelves, going in proceſſion, or on pilgrimage, repeating certain
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50919:146"/>words, and forms of prayer, it alſo dependeth upon times, having its years, its months, its days, its feſtivals, and its very hours all regulated. This was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry form of the carnal, or ceremonial ſervice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that other kind of ſervice; that JESUS CHRIST gave us in His Goſpel; which without being bound up to theſe childiſh ſcruples of times, of places, and of things, doth wholly conſiſt in a pure, and genuine worſhiping of GOD, in loving and fearing Him, and tenderly affecting our neighbour, in honeſty, and juſtice, and in a true, and lively ſanctity. Accordingly you know, that whereas the former ſervice is termed carnal, the latter is ſtiled ſpiritual. The one is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in ſhadow, the other in truth; the one in fleſh, the other in ſpirit. 'Tis then, in my opinion, all that firſt ſort of carnal ſervices, from what Source ſoever they flow, either the inſtitution of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the invention of any other man, that the Apoſtle doth here call the rudiments of the world; declaring that we have been freed from it, by our LORD JESUS CHRIST; remaining no longer ſubject to all this childiſh, and infantile pedagogy; nor bound up to houres, or times, or elements, or other parts of the world; but being raiſed above all theſe things, ſo as we may make uſe of them with full liberty, according to the intereſts of Piety, and charity; and not be any more imbondaged to them, or depend upon them.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe JESUS CHRIST hath procured us this great benefit by His death, and does put us in poſſeſſion of it, by the communion we have with Him in reſpect thereof; thence it comes, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets forth this grace, of His freeing us from ſubjection to the rudiments of the world, in terms that referr thereto, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not ſingly, that we are delivered from ſuch kind of ſervices, by JESUS CHRIST but that we are dead with Him, as to the rudiments of the world. An expreſſion, exceeding graceful, and elegant. It ſignifies, firſt, that we are no longer ſubject to theſe rudiments of the world. For the dead are out of all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. The Laws demand nothing of them any more. Neither their Lords, nor their maſters, have any power, to require ought of them, any longer. Death breaks all the bonds, that tyed them to any ſubjection whatever. The Apoſtle ſaith therefore, we are dead to the rudiments of the world, to ſignifie that we are freed from them; that we are no more ſubject to them; as he tells us elſewhere, to the ſame ſenſe, <hi>that we are dead to the Law;</hi> and again in another place,

                        <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>dead to the Law, that I might live to GOD.</hi> And thus too it is, that we muſt take his affirming elſewhere, that <hi>we are dead to ſin,</hi> that is to ſay, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from its tyranny. And becauſe death puts an end to, and aboliſheth the power, and authority of the maſter, as well as the ſervitude, and ſubjection of the vaſſal, thence it comes, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith indifferently, that ſin, and the commandment of the old Law, are dead to us, and that we are dead to them, ſignifying by the one, and the other, that we are Subjects of theirs no more.</p>
                     <p>But S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying here, <hi>that we are dead with CHRIST, as to the rudiments of the world,</hi> doth ſhew us, in the ſecond place, both the cauſe of our liberty (JESUS CHRIST) and the means, by which He acquired it for us, to wit, His death. We are dead to all ceremonial ſervices; for that our LORD hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and aboliſhed them, in dying for us. For His death hath ſatisfied all the reaſons, upon which theſe rudiments of the world were, for a time, appointed. It hath procured that righteouſneſs, which they repreſented, and exhibited that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which they promiſed, and brought in the ſubſtance, whereof they were but ſhadows. It hath opened the houſe of GOD unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom they bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it; and put an end to the Old Teſtament, to which they pertained; and founded the new, an eternal, and immutable one, which they prefigured. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Veil of the Temple was rent, from the top to the bottom, at the time that JESUS ſuffered death; for a token, that the antient worſhip, whereof this Veil was a ſymbole, became thenceforth abrogated, and annulled.</p>
                     <p>In fine, theſe words of the Apoſtle do diſcover to us further, an apt reſemblance, that is found to be, between the LORD's death on the Croſs, and our freedom from the yoke of Ceremonies. For as JESUS in dying did diveſt Himſelf of the former life, He led here below, during the days of His fleſh, in infirmity, and in ſubjection to the elements of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to take up a new one by His reſurrection;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50919:147"/>which was to be free, divine, and coeleſtial; ſo we conformly, by vertue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, we have with Him, and particularly in His death, do lay down that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer manner of life, that conſiſteth in the childiſh exerciſes of ſome carnal abſtinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and devotions, to live henceforth in the liberty of children of GOD, ſerving Him, no more in ſhadow, and in figure, but in ſpirit, and in truth, with a conſcience pure, and an heart, not bound up to the places, things, and times of the old world, but continually elevated to that new, incorruptible, and eternal one, above the heavens, where JESUS CHRIST, the author, and prince of our religion, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is. Such is this Evangelical verity, here laid down by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Text; that we are dead with CHRIST, as to the rudiments of the world.</p>
                     <p>Whereby, to mention it by the way, you may ſee, how much out in their recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they are, who place the perfection of the faithful, in the practiſing of theſe carnal diſciplines, and devotions, accounting thoſe for perfect, who do uſe them, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> on the contrary, terms them here, the rudiments of the world: ſo as the ſubjecting of Chriſtians to ſuch diſciplines, is ſo farr from being a perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ing them back to their <hi>ABC.</hi> and a reducing them, from the higheſt Claſſis of the School of GOD, down to the loweſt, there to become children again, and lead a childiſh life, with the diſciples of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in an apprentiſhip to his rudiments, and under the Ferule of his pedagogie.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle, from this principle thus aſſerted, concludes againſt the falſe teachers, that all their ordinances, touching abſtinence from certain meats, were vain, unjuſt, and tyrannical. <hi>If therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye be dead with CHRIST, as to the rudiments of the world, why are ye burthened with ordinances, as if ye lived in the world?</hi> Afterwards, he reports, and expreſly ſpecifies ſome of thoſe ordinances, which men would impoſe upon the faithful, namely, <hi>Eat not, Touch not, Taſte not.</hi> The force, and the coherence of his argumentation is evident. 'Tis an injuſtice, (ſaith he) and a tyranny, ſtill to burthen thoſe with worldly ordinances, who are dead to the world. You are dead to its rudiments, by the benefit of CHRIST, who hath, by His death, aboliſhed all this kind of carnal diſciplines, and ſervices; and nailed up, and torn, upon His Croſs, the obligation to them. By His grace, you live no longer in the world, in the School of Figures, and terrene Ceremonies. You live henceforth in Heaven, in the light, and liberty of the Spirit. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſometimes apply the word, world, to the ſtate of GOD's people, within their land of <hi>Canaan</hi> heretofore, in the ſchool of their <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the performance of a terrene, and carnal ſervice. And therefore it is, that he elſewhere terms the Levitical Sanctuary,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.1.</note> a worldly Sanctuary. The faithful then being without this <hi>Moſaique</hi> world, it is clear, that no man juſtly can impoſe upon them, in matter of religion, any laws or ordinances of this nature; and that ſuch, as attempt it, do outrage Him that freed them, and oppreſs the liberty of His people; and that every one may juſtly, reject their yoke, and oppoſe their tyranny.</p>
                     <p>Neither may it be alledged, that the ordinances promoted are none of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s; but others quite different. For what ones ſoever they be, a yoke they are, and every yoke, of what matter, and form ſoever, deprives us of our liberty. Beſides, very probable it is, that the Apoſtle, does, as we have expounded it, by the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, intend, not particularly the Moſaical ſervice alone, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all ſuch ſervice, as is bodily, and of the ſame nature, that that of <hi>Moſes</hi> was. And in fine, though you ſhould take it ſimply for the Moſaique laws, yet would S. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument be good, and concluſive from the greater to the leſs; as who ſhould ſay; If you be ſet free from the yoke of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was framed, and put upon the necks of the antient people, by the expreſs appointment of GOD; how much more from one of men? If CHRIST hath delivered you from ſuch ordinances, as it cannot be denyed, but GOD was author of; how intolerable is the headineſs of thoſe men, who burthen you with their laws? Indeed, who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that GOD ſhould have freed us, from commands of His own, to put us under thoſe of others? and that His Son ſhould have delivered us from a yoke of GOD's, to load us with one of mortal mens? and that He ſhould have exempted
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50919:147"/>us from the rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to yeeld us up unto the ſcourges of theſe new <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to theſe ordinances, which the Apoſtle here produceth, doubtleſs they were the Seducers; and not his own, as the Author of the Comment on <hi>S. Paul</hi> that goes under the name of <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> ſome one of the Ancients againſt all ſemblance of truth, and reaſon, did imagine. <hi>S. Paul's</hi> ſaying afore, <hi>Let no man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you in meat, or in drink,</hi> doth ſufficiently ſhew, that they were the magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ordinances of theſe pretended Legiſlators; who did very ſeverely command their people, not only to forbear the eating, but even the taſting, and touching of ſuch meats, as they prohibited. The firſt of thoſe three words, that the Apoſtle uſeth, does in the Greek language properly ſignifie, to touch; and the Latin In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, as alſo many others, have taken it in that ſenſe here, tranſlating, <hi>Touch not, taſt not, handle not.</hi> And our adverſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> do underſtand it, of the prohibitions in the <hi>Moſaique</hi> Law, of touching, or handling, a dead body for inſtance, or ſuch other things, as the <hi>Jews</hi> might not touch without being counted unclean. In like manner, they referr, what is ſaid of taſting, to the prohibition of eating Swines-fleſh, and the Hare, and other meats, the uſe whereof was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Law; as if the falſe Teachers, at whom the Apoſtle aimes, would have introduced among Chriſtians, no other ordinances then thoſe of the <hi>Moſaique</hi> Law.</p>
                     <p>But this whole expoſition is incommodious, and croſſeth the Apoſtle's meaning. If he had had that thought, it would have ſufficed to ſay once Touch not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuperadding a third word, of the ſame ſignification, to wit, touching, or handling. Not to urge, that this cannot accord with that which follows, where he ſaith, that theſe things were ſet up after the commandments, and doctrines of men; it being evident, that the prohibitions in the <hi>Moſaique</hi> Law, were made by the authority, not of men, but of GOD; ſo as if the Seducers had preſs'd no other thing, it had been harſh, that I may not ſay falſe, to accuſe them, of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinances after the doctrines of men; and they would without doubt have anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd, that they were founded upon the commandment of GOD. In fine, the Apoſtle's ſaying, that the things, an abſtinence from which the Seducers ordered, were all ſuch, as did periſh in the uſing, doth ſubvert this expoſition, and evidently ſhew, that the things forbidden by thoſe falſe Teachers, were only meat and drink; and not dead bodies, or other ſubſtances, the touching whereof was prohibited by the Law. For ſince, the things he ſpeaks of, are conſumed, are deſtroyed, and do all periſh by the uſing and on the other hand, it is moſt evident, that the things, which the <hi>Jews</hi> were forbid to touch, are not at all of that nature, (that is, ſuch as periſh in the uſing) it muſt of neceſſity be concluded, that it is not of them <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaks: but of thoſe only, that ſerve for the food of man, which are all conſum'd by the uſe that is made of them, in eating, or drinking the ſame. And in the end we muſt come back to the interpretation that our Bibles do exhibit, which have very rightly rendred this paſſage in theſe words, Eat not, taſte not, touch not. For though the firſt of theſe three words does frequently, and commonly ſignifie to touch, yet ſuch, as underſtand the Greek, doe know, that it is ſometimes taken for, to eat. As our Expoſitors have produced inſtances of, from good, and irrefragable Authors.</p>
                     <p>Now in theſe three words thus ranked, as they are, the Apoſtle repreſents unto us by the way, both the order of the ſcrupulous devotions of ſuperſtition, and the progreſs of the tyrannie of theſe Legiſlators. At firſt, they forbid the eating of certain meats, that is, the uſing them at your ordinary meals. If they win this ground, they proceed further, and will debarr you even from taſting them. At laſt they poſſeſs you with ſcruple to touch them, as if the mere contact of ſuch things were apt to pollute you. There is no end in the ſcruples of ſuperſtition, nor any meaſure in it's devotions, and obſervances. It heaps them up daily one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is never ſatiated with this vain food. It never ſayes, 'tis enough; it's alway ſaying, <hi>give, give,</hi> like the wiſeman's horſe-leach in the Proverbs.
<note place="margin">Prov. 30.15.</note> If it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate your eating to day, to morrow it will give you laws for your clothing, and afterwards for each of the parts of your life; not leaving ſo much as your looks, or
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50919:148"/>your breathing, free. It's a Labyrinth, wherein poor conſciences go on intricating them ſelves, without any iſſue; and a ſnare, which does firſt take them, than bind them faſt, and in the end ſtrangle them.</p>
                     <p>But let us now conſider, the two other reaſons which the Apoſtle makes uſe of, to ſhew the vanity of the pretended ordinances of ſuperſtition about the matter of meats, and eating, and drinking. The ſecond than is taken, as we have already intimated, from the nature of thoſe things, which abſtinence from, was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They are all (ſaith he) things, that periſh in the uſing. That is, ſuch as are conſumed, in doing us ſervice; the very eating, and drinking, whereby they are taken, doth deſtroy them; and they are of ſo feeble, and infirm a ſubſtance, that they cannot be of uſe unto us, without being corrupted; and to nouriſh us, they muſt firſt periſh; an evident ſigne, that all the benefit, we receive from them, doth reſpect, but this wretched mortal life; it being neither poſſible, nor imaginable, that what periſheth, and is conſumed in us, ſhould have any force, or vertue for the life of our ſoul, which is immortal, and incorruptible. So you ſee, the Apoſtle does here preſuppoſe this maxime; that neither Religion, nor the ſervice of GOD, doth properly, and immediatly conſiſt, either in the uſage of, or an abſtinence from, any of thoſe things, which ſerve to the maintaining of our common life and are conſumed in ſerving thereto:

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50919:148"/>The Apoſtle rejects the ordinances of the Seducers, becauſe they are commandments and doctrines of men. There's no man but ſees, that this diſcourſe hath no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, unleſs upon preſuppoſal, that nothing ought to be receiv'd in Religion, under the quality of neceſſary belief, or ſervice, except it be, either taught, or commanded of GOD, and not of men only. It's the doctrine of the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paul</hi> in this place; the doctrine of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in that other, which we alledged even now; it's the doctrine of JESUS, the Maſter of Apoſtles, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, in His diſpute againſt the Phariſees. O holy, and pretious verity, from how many errors wouldſt thou deliver the world, if according to the authority of our LORD, and thoſe two grand Miniſters of His, men would examine all things by thee as their rule! and conſider when ſome article in Religion is preached to us, not whether it be ſpecious, and have ſome appearance of reaſon; or whether it hath been yerwhile held by the Sages of the time paſt; or be for the preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the greater part of Princes, and people; but whether it be indeed taught of GOD, in His word; or meerly ſet forth by men.</p>
                     <p>Dear Brethren; by this ſhort, and ſimple method, you may eaſily ſettle your thoughts, about all the differences, that rend Chriſtendom at this day. Take the Book of GOD; and admit nothing into your belief, but what you ſhall find, either aſſerted, or commanded therein; refuſing whatſoever the word of the LORD hath not authorized. Sure I am, that the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, and Purgatory, and Tranſubſtantiation, and the Monarchie of the Pope, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints, and in a word, all that divideth us from <hi>Rome,</hi> will remain, among thoſe commandments, and doctrines of men, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> here caſts away from our faith; and that nothing will be found, among the commandments, and doctrines of GOD, but thoſe Services, and beliefs, which are received, and confeſſed, by our Churches. In the Name of GOD, make trial of it, if ſo be, you have not yet done it; and you will ſee, that if our Adverſaries have the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men for them, we have the doctrines of GOD, of His Prophets, and Apoſtles for us. I paſs by other doctrines of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the preſent. Only, how can they defend their ordinances, for the eating of no fleſh, during more then a third part of the year? commanding the faithful, to live all that time, upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Herbs, and Fiſh, under pain of damnation? preſſing this ridiculous Law, with ſo much rigour that they do not hold ſuch for Chriſtians, as do tranſgreſs it? and puniſh them, not with Spiritual pains only, but even with temporal, unto death it ſelf, in the Countries, where the Inquiſition reigneth? Is not this, the doing with high hand, what the Apoſtle here forbiddeth? <hi>Let no man condemn you, in eating, or drinking? and why are ye burthened with ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, to wit, Eat not, taſte not?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas they ſay, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks, only of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Prohibitions of touching the dead, and taſting the fleſh of the Hog, and Hare; this we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready refuted. He ſpeaks in general of all ordinances, that forbid the taſting of any ſort of meat, upon a Religious account. And it is no way credible that he ſhould grant the Pope, or any other man whoever, what he denies <hi>Moſes;</hi> or reſpect their Laws, more then his. Beſides, all the circumſtances, and reaſons, which he noteth, or urgeth againſt the Laws of the falſe teachers, are evidently of force againſt thoſe of our adverſaries. Thoſe teachers ordeined, that theſe ſhould be no eating, nor taſting of certain meats. Theſe men do the ſame. They recommended their abſtinences, upon pretence that they did humble the body, and not ſpare it. This is exactly the thing, that our Adverſaries affirm of theirs The Apoſtle alledgeth againſt them, that they ſtitch'd up again the Veil of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which had been rent in twain by JESUS CHRIST; and reduced that carnal, and worldly worſhip into the Church, which had been abrogated, and aboliſh'd by the Croſs of our LORD. Is it not a Service of the ſame kind, that thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> do ſet up? a Service, which conſiſts in things purely external, and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, to wit, eating, and meats? <hi>S. Paul</hi> addeth, that the things, from which the Seducers required Chriſtians to abſtein, were all ſuch, as periſh'd in the uſing. Thoſe, about which our Adverſaries make Laws, are they not conſumed in the very ſame manner? the fleſh, which they forbid? the Fiſh, and Herbs, which
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:50919:149"/>they command? In fine, S. <hi>Paul</hi> rejects the Ordinances of the Seducers, becauſe they were Doctrines, and Commandments of men. Thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which the ſame quality doth adhere, ought not then to be any more tolerated, than they. For how hardly ſoever the men be, they durſt not ſay, that GOD appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. They only ſay, that they are conform to Scripture. But how ſo, while they ſo rudely claſh with the Apoſtle's Doctrine in this place.</p>
                     <p>As to their allegation,
<note place="margin">Dan. 1.8.</note> that the Hebrew Children would not eat of the meats of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Table; the Scripture tells us, they did it for fear of being defiled: to wit, becauſe the moſt part of the meats of Pagans, was offered to Idols. Beſide they doubted, there might be ſome one of thoſe things, which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> under which they lived; cauſes, as every one knows, that take place no longer, and are in effect very far off from the reaſons of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinences of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 10.2.</note> They produce alſo <hi>Daniel</hi>'s three weeks, during which neither Fleſh, nor Wine, entred into his mouth. They ſhould add, what the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly reports, that he did eat no pleaſant bread, nor anoint himſelf, all that while; becauſe (as he ſaith himſelf) he was mourning. Whence it follows indeed, that ſuch as are in mourning, and affliction of ſpirit, may if they ſee good, baniſh all the pleaſures of their manner of living even to thoſe that are innocent, permitted, and ordinary, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did at that time, out of his own judgement, and not upon any publick commandment. But it cannot be thence concluded, that either there was then, or that there ought to be a Law for perpetuity in the Chriſtian Church, which forbids the uſe of meats for certain times of the year, which is preciſely the thing that our Adverſaries pretend.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.23.</note> I paſs by <hi>Timothy</hi>'s abſtinence, who drank no Wine. For there is little probability, that it was through a Religious ſcruple, he abſtained. Beſide, He was a particular perſon, and did the thing at his own arbitriment, not by the order of any publick Law. And yet too S. <hi>Paul</hi> recommends to him, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe; and in fine, the queſtion is now of Meats, not of Wine, which thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> do prohibit to none, at all. I alſo pretermit the Faſts of the Iſraelites on divers occaſions; as were thoſe of <hi>Anna,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Eſther,</hi> of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and his Diſciples; theſe have no Communion with the abſtinences in hand. We do not refuſe Faſts, (far be it from us) We do not ſimply, and abſolutely forbid even ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence. (For it is equally in a Chriſtians liberty, to eat, or not to eat, any ſort of meat whatever; neither the one, nor the other is a ſin, provided it be done in Faith, and Charity.) All, that the Apoſtle condemns, and we with him, and after him, is the Tyrannie, that prohibits, what GOD permits; and will needs make that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which He hath left free; as alſo, the Superſtition, that placeth the true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of GOD, in things purely indifferent. It remains then, we conclude, that this Law of our Adverſaries is a Doctrine, and a Commandment of men, ſince it hath no foundation in the Word of GOD.</p>
                     <p>But which is more, it's evidently adverſe thereto. For the Apoſtle, writing to the faithful at <hi>Corinth,</hi> that lived in the midſt of an Heathen people, in whoſe Markets, and at whoſe Tables, all ſorts of meats were indifferently ſold, and ſerved up, he gives them this rule;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.25, 27.</note> 
                        <hi>Eat of all that is ſold in the Shambles, making no queſtion for Conſcience ſake. And if one of them that believe not does invite you, and ye be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go, eat of all that's ſet before you, making no queſtion for Conſcience ſake.</hi> How doth this accord with the Roman Laws, that make ſcruple of ſo many ſorts of meat for Conſcience ſake?

                           </gap> Tim. 4.1, 2.</note> But this holy man hath proceeded much further yet. He hath not only refuted this errour; He hath predicted it, and given us timely Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, ranking Abſtinence from meats, expreſly among the Articles of the falſe Doctrine of thoſe Seducers, whoſe coming he propheſied of; deſcribing them by dreadful marks, that he might poſſeſs us with a juſt horrour at them. Neither may it be anſwered, that he ſpeaks of ſuch, as hold the nature of meats to be impure, and polluted in it ſelf. He attributes no ſuch thing to thoſe, whom he condemneth; and ſaith ſimply, that they would command to abſtain from meats: If our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries do not ſo command; we do wrong to apply this Text unto them. But ſince they eminently command the thing, and ſo mightily eſteem the command, that they deny him the name of a Chriſtian, who doth violate it; it is clear, that of them
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:50919:149"/>alſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks. He alledgeth, it is true, that every creature of GOD is good, and was created to be uſed by the faithful, with thankſgiving. He alledgeth this, I ſay, to refute this error; as we alſo make uſe of it to refute that of <hi>Rome.</hi> But he doth not at all impute to them, whom he oppoſeth, that they did former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny this verity; and hereafter we ſhall hear, that thoſe whom he does in this place refute, did ordain their abſtinences, for the humbling of the ſpirit, and the mortifying of the fleſh (altogether after the ſame manner, as our adverſaries at this day do,) and not out of any opinion they had, that the meats they prohibited, were unclean, or polluted in their nature. Accordingly we read, that the ancient Chriſtians who lived about the end of the ſecond Century, and the beginning of the third, did not forbear condemning the Montaniſts laws of abſtinence, and to apply to them that paſſage of the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which we quoted even now; though thoſe Hereticks proteſted, as they of <hi>Rome</hi> do at this day, that it was not intended againſt them, who believed, with Catholicks, both the Divinity of the Creator and the goodneſs, and purity of the creatures, but againſt the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> and the Encratites, who denied the one, or the other, or both of them together; as we learn, by a certain book of <hi>Tertullians,</hi> in which he expreſly pleadeth the cauſe of <hi>Montanus</hi> againſt the Orthodox, whom, in deriſion,
<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus having refuted the error of thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, I ſhould now come to anſwer their revilings. For upon the pretext, of our diſapproving the tyrannicall law of their abſtinences, they accuſe us of being <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and our Religion, altogether a Religion of fleſh, and blood, and favouring gourman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and drunkenneſs; as if it were neither poſſible, to commit exceſs with fiſh, nor to exerciſe ſobriety with any other food. It is not now adays only, that this error, being unable to defend it ſelf with reaſon, hath had recourſe to railing. The <hi>Jews,</hi> at the beginning, ſeeing our Saviour live ſimply, without the pomp of their faſts, and abſtinences, called Him <hi>a glutton, and a wine-bibber;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 11.19.</note> the Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts afterwards cryed out, upon the Catholicks of thoſe dayes, as they of <hi>Rome</hi> do upon us at preſent; that the belly was their god;
<note place="margin">Tertullian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ibid.</note> and the Buttery their Altar, and a Kitchin their Temple, and a Cook their Prieſt, and the ſteam of meats, their Holy-Spirit, and ſauces their gifts of Grace. Let it not ſhame us, to be treated, as the Son of GOD was, with His firſt and beſt diſciples. I might here ſay many things, of our morals, and the morals of our adverſaries, and perhaps it would be found, that our <hi>Carnavel</hi> is no leſs ſober, than their <hi>Lent;</hi> and their abſtinence many times as intemperate, as our pretended diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs. But it is better, to refute their ſlanders, by the honeſty of our lives, than with the acrimony of our words.</p>
                     <p>Shew then, dearly beloved Brethren, by your ſobriety, purity, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that it is not the love of the fleſh, as calumny gives out, but reſpect to truth, which makes you embrace the party you do.

For as thoſe that would make a falſe ſtone paſs for a Diamond, or an Emerald, or a Ruby, do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as farr as cunning is able to counterfeit the truth, to give it the colour, the ſhape, the luſtre, the ſparkling, and other qualities thereof, that by ſuch a feigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, they may deceive ſimple, and unexperienced perſons: So they, that have ſet themſelves upon the corrupting of Religion, to the end they might make the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ſervices they promoted, be received for ſound doctrines, and diſciplines, have above all things taken a great deal of pains, to guild over their merchandize, and to colour it with ſome fair, and ſpecious pretexts, fit to dazle the eyes of men, and hide the defects of their doctrine, and give it the ſhew of what in ſubſtance it is not.</p>
                     <p>It is this, that the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth obſerve here in the documents, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of thoſe Seducers, whom he undertook in this Chapter. For having ſolidly, and admirably refuted that ſuperſtitious diſcipline, which they had ſet a foot, and which conſiſted in a religious worſhipping of Angels, and in a ſcrupulous abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from certain meats, and in the obſervation of certain feſtival days; for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, he diſcovers in this laſt verſe, the falſe colours, wherewith they did in vain dawb it over. He acknowledgeth, that it had, its true, ſome ſhew of wiſdom; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that this was ſufficient to cover its defects, or to oblige the faithful to receive it. Their Ordinances (ſaid he afore) are commandments, and doctrines of men: Which
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:50919:152"/>yet (he now adds) have ſome ſhew of wiſdom in voluntary devotion, and humility of ſpirit, and in that they do not at all ſpare the body, and have no regard to the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fleſh. It is evident, that he ſpeaks of thoſe humane doctrines, which he had been mentioning, in the verſe immediately foregoing; and he ſays, firſt, that they have a ſhew of wiſdom: Next, he repreſents particularly three things, which give them this falſe ſhew, voluntary ſervice, humility of ſpirit, and rough treatment of the body, which they did not at all ſpare. Theſe are, as it were, the three colours, which being mingled together by the artifice of the Seducers, compoſed that paint, which rendred their doctrine plauſible, and gave it this falſe ſhew of wiſdom, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled the eyes of the ſimple. In compliance with this diſtinction, we ſhall treat of three points in this action, voluntary ſervice, humility of ſpirit, and little care for the body, and then conſider, how error, and ſuperſtition have always made, and ſtill to this day make uſe of them, to gloſe their inventions. GOD grant us to beware du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them, and pleaſe for this end, ſo to guide and aſſiſt us, by His Spirit, in diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them, as we may all bear away ſome Edification and Conſolation.</p>
                     <p>The name of wiſdom is great, and honourable in the opinion of all people in the world. For whereas other Sciences have reſpect but to natural, or humane; the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wiſdom is to Divine things. And whereas other knowledges, are for the moſt part, unprofitable to him, who poſſeſſeth them, that of wiſdom, is ſalutiferous: it ſignifying the skill of conducting ones way aright for the attainment of happineſs, by the light of ſome choice, and excellent verities. Whence it follows, that this title of wiſdom doth not properly belong, but to the knowledge of GOD, which, He hath given us, by His Son, in the Goſpel, the only light, that is capable of conducting us to ſupreme felicity. Accordingly you know, it is the name, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> does ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give it; as when he willeth, that the word of GOD dwell richly in us in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and when he ſaith elſewhere, that he ſpeaks wiſdom among them that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, calling the ſame a little after, the wiſdom of GOD in a myſterie, the hidden wiſdom; and ſo often elſewhere. Now though the doctrine of thoſe, who corrupt the Goſpel, as theſe Seducers did, who S. <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth in this Chapter, be nothing leſs in reality, than wiſdom, yet ſo it is, that its authors gave it the name, and would have it paſs in the belief of men, for a rare, and a beneficial knowledge, more worthy of heaven, than earth, and capable in fine of rendring thoſe that follow it, perfect, and happy. The Apoſtle acknowledgeth, that the doctrine of the Seducers of his time, had this ſhew of wiſdom; but by his very granting them the ſhew, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> denies them the truth of it; and his meaning is, that that doctrine of theirs had nothing but a falſe, and a deceitful colour of wiſdom, not the ſubſtance, and reality of the thing.</p>
                     <p>Voluntary ſervice is the firſt particular, that gave theſe doctrines of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers ſuch a ſhew. They have, ſaith the Apoſtle, ſome ſhew of wiſdom in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſervice, that is, by reaſon, or becauſe of the voluntary ſervice, they taught, and ſet a foot: the obſervances, and inſtitutions, which theſe men enjoyed, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from certain meats, the worſhipping of Angels, and the like being nothing elſe, but voluntary ſervices. A ſervice may be called voluntary, two manner of waies. Firſt, when he that performs it unto GOD, doth it with affection, and a good will; without torment, and conſtraint. The love, he bears this great and ſoveraign LORD, ſweetly bringing his ſoul under His yoke, and diſpoſing him to account, whatſoever He hath commanded, to be good, and delectable. In this ſenſe, that free, and ſincere obedience, which true believers render unto GOD, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel, may be ſtiled voluntary; becauſe it proceeds, not from a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage, as theirs doth; who do ſerve, only becauſe they are afraid; but from a ſpirit of Love, and of Adoption, crying in their hearts, Abba Father. Wherefore the Prophet termeth the new people, who render this frank and filial ſervice unto GOD,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.3.</note> under the Goſpel of the Meſſiah, a voluntary or willing people. Thy people (ſaith he, ſpeaking to Him) ſhall be a voluntary people, or a people of frank wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, in the day, that thou ſhalt aſſemble thine army, in holy pomp. It is not in this ſenſe, that the Apoſtle underſtands, the voluntary ſervice; he ſpeaks of in this place. For firſt, though the terms voluntary ſervice, which are taken up in the <hi>French,</hi> to expreſs what S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſet down, may be ſo underſtood; yet true it is, the Greek word he uſed in the Original text, is never ſo taken, as the intelligent do
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50919:152"/>know. Again this kind of Voluntary ſervice doth conſiſt in things, which GOD hath expreſly commanded: but the Service here meant by the Apoſtle, not ſo.</p>
                     <p>We are to know then, that the Voluntary ſervice, he ſpeaks of is worſhip, which GOD did not, by His word, oblige men unto; nor ever commanded them; but they preſent it Him, meerly of their own will, ſubjecting themſelves, and others to it, becauſe it ſo pleaſes them, without any neceſſity impoſed, on GOD'S part, who demanded no ſuch thing of them. It is Voluntary, not in regard of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, after which it is performed; (for in this ſenſe, as we have ſaid, the Service of true Children of GOD, may be alſo termed Voluntary;) but in regard of it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; the principle, that ſets it up, and preſſeth the performance of it, being not the Law, or the authority of GOD, but ſingly the will of men, who of their forwardneſs, undertake to do things, to the honour of GOD, and for His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which He for His part, never gave order for. Whence it comes, that the word is, in the language of the Greeks, ordinarily taken in an ill ſenſe, as importing Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; becauſe it is the property of this vice, to invent divers Services of it's ſelf, and pretend, to pay off the Deity with them.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle, pointing here, at the thing, that gave the Seducers doctrine, the ſhew, and luſtre, which it had, it cannot be doubted, but he means their Service its being Voluntary, and not its being ſuperſtitious, though indeed it were ſo too. For Superſtition being generally decried, and known to be a vice, 'tis clear, that in that quality, it is not a thing capable of recommending any ones doctrine; nor were there ever found Seducers ſo groſs, as to profeſs, that their worſhip was ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: much leſs to vant of it, and pretend to render it recommendable thereby. But Voluntary ſervice doth charm men, and pleaſe their carnal ſenſe. And falſe Teachers for the moſt part, do not forbear to glory in it, and alledge it for a mark of the ſublime wiſdome of their doctrine. There are of it two ſorts; the one groſs, and ſhameleſs to the higheſt degree, which would make that paſs for Service of GOD, which He not only hath not commanded, but even expreſly prohibited; as when the Idolaters in the wilderneſs, counted the feſtival they kept before their Golden Calf, and the honours they gave it, things which GOD had expreſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted, for worſhip performed to the LORD their GOD. Such alſo in effect was that Religious Serving of Angels, which the Apoſtle taxed afore; though it may not be doubted, but the Seducers who introduced it, did endeavour, by divers ſubtilities, to elude thoſe paſſages of Scripture, in which we are forbidden to do Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Service unto any creature whatſoever. The other ſort of Voluntary ſervice, hath a little more ſhamefac'dneſs, and modeſtie, then the former; when a man or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deineth, and if we may ſo ſay, erecteth into the title of a Divine ſervice, the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of certain things, which verily GOD hath not commanded, but which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath He forbidden, as abſtinence from certain meats, and the obſervation of certain dayes; things, which, it ſeems, GOD hath neither commanded nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. It is properly to this rank, we muſt aſſign that Voluntary ſervice, which the Apoſtle intendeth in the Text. For even they, who inſtitute ſuch Services of the firſt ſort do not yet own them to be ſo; but pretended, that GOD hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, what they command, gloſſing thoſe paſſages, in which He forbids it, and ſo artificially changing the true, and genuine ſenſe of them, as they make it believ'd, that the objects of their Service are not comprehended in it.</p>
                     <p>Now that this gives their Inventions a ſhew of wiſdome, as the Apoſtle here ſayes, and a luſtre, fair, and plauſible in the eyes of carnal men, is very clear. For firſt, it ſeems magnifique, and Heroical, to be uncontented with what GOD hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, for His Service; and to have the reſolution to exceed it. That which He hath commanded, being evidently due, and of indubitable equity; it ſeems a ſmall mater, to do but this; becauſe it is ſimply nothing elſe, then the diſcharging of what a man ows; which does ſeem to be a vertue not ſo exceedingly recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; For whoever heard Panegyriques made in ones praiſe, becauſe he duly payd his debts? Accordingly you ſee, that preſumptuous young man, who is mention'd in the Goſpel, made no great account of all this. For when our Saviour, told him ſimply, what GOD commands us in His Law, he anſwers diſdainfully,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.20.</note> that <hi>he had kept all thoſe things from his youth;</hi> as if he had ſaid, that was his ordinary, his daily
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50919:153"/>practice, and that he expected a quite other thing, from ſo great a Teacher. But when a man doth, what he is not bound to do, he is admired; as we much more eſteem him, who gives what he doth not owe, then him who ſimply makes puctual payment of what he doth owe. Beſides, it ſeems an act of a great and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary love to GOD, to ſubject that very thing to Him, which He hath left free to us. The fear of the Cudgel of times makes a Slave do all, that his Maſter hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him; but it ſeems, that nothing, but love, can oblige him to do more. Again, this very hardineſs, of daring to ſet up ſome certain ſort of actions, in the Service of GOD, hath a kind of, I know not what, grandeur in it becauſe common ſenſe dictating to us, that to ordein Service for Him, is properly the act of a Divine authority, we preſently take them for Divine men, who enterpriſe ſuch a thing. It may alſo be, then that character of an humane Spirit, which appears in theſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſervices, makes them to be the more eſteemed by men; every one naturally loving his own productions, and favouring his own works.</p>
                     <p>Be it for theſe reaſons, or for others, once certain it is, that Voluntary ſervices, are ordinarily eſteemed, and admired by men. And you ſee it clearly, by experience of what is done, in the communion of <hi>Rome.</hi> For though conſidering things through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no man can doubt, but Innocence, Charity, and Juſtice, are much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then thoſe Voluntary obſervances, which are practiſed among them; yet it is evident, that much more account is made of theſe, then of the others. For the one they call ſimply, good works. But the others exceed it. They are works of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerogation. There was need to forge this new word, our common languages having none loſty enough, to expreſs the extraordinary altitude of their merit. Hence it comes, that <hi>Monks,</hi> if you believe them, are Angels, and Demi-gods. They are look'd upon, as ſo many Heavenly Jewels; ſo many Starrs, and Luminaries; as the only Ornaments of the Earth, and of their Church. But they ſet at this rate, none of thoſe, who without Frock, and without little band, and without particular rule, do lead an honeſt, and irreprehenſible life in a ſecular habit. The reaſon of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is that the former do exerciſe themſelves in ſuch Voluntary ſervices, as <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Dominick,</hi> and <hi>Bruno,</hi> and <hi>Loiola,</hi> have preſcribed, them; whereas the latter do addict themſelves to that which GOD hath commanded them: though indeed no man can deny, but that to oblige men, right the oppreſſed, ſuccour the needy, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Widow, and the Fatherleſs (the things that GOD hath commanded) be incomparably better, and more excellent, then to put on a Capouche, or go with bare feet, and ſhaven crown, or ſcourge ones ſelf twice or thrice a week, which are things that men ordein. In like manner you ſee, that in that communion, none are commonly canonized, (which is the higheſt point of honour they do to piety) but ſuch as have regularly faſted, and Diſciplin'd themſelves, and liv'd in coelibat, and (as they ſay) done Miracles; things all, which GOD hath not at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in His Word. As for thoſe, who content themſelves with the Religion, and vertues which GOD hath ordeined, nor do affect Voluntary ſervices; they muſt not pretend to be ranked among the Saints of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I think, there is yet another ſecret reaſon, which hath as much, or more efficacy, then all the reſt, in making Voluntary ſervices to be ſo well receiv'd by men; namely, that great aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they naturally have for thoſe things, that are commanded of GOD: from obligation whereunto, they hope to redeem themſelves, either in whole, or in part at leaſt, by means of humane Services. For what countenance ſoever they make, of finding the obedience of GOD's commandments very eaſie; yet in reality there is nothing to which they ſubmit, ſo unwillingly, and with greater pain; ſo as all the auſterity of Voluntary ſervice is pleaſant, in compariſon of it. Being then p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſſeſs'd with this falſe prejudice, that by abſteining from what GOD permits, or by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to what He doth not command, they ſhall in reaſon oblige Him, to diſpence with for what He doth command, upon hope of this exchange, they gladly take up Voluntary ſervice, which alſo, you know, they do indeed hold to be ſatisfactions, that is, a kind of ranſom, at the price whereof they are delivered from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they did incurr, for not having ſerved GOD, as He commandeth. Thus you ſee, Dear Brethren, that Voluntary ſervice gives a luſtre, and a vain ſhew of wiſdome, to humane doctrines, and traditions.</p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:50919:153"/>
                     <p>The ſecond head of things, that contributes to this effect, and that renders the ſame hugely recommendable, is humility of Spirit; the Apoſtle hath already noted heretofore, the affectation, and ſhew of this pretended humility, in one of the doctrines of theſe Seducers particularly, to wit, their teaching the Service of Angels: which they did with pretence, that the putting of the faithful in ſubjection to thoſe bleſſed Spirits, was to humble them. Here he ſpeaks of it more generally. For beſides, that all the outſide of falſe Teachers is commonly painted over with the colours of a great, and deep humility, their diſcourſe, and all their procedure being full of ſubmiſſions, and of an high profeſſion of renouncing the advantages of vain glory; beſides this, I ſay, their inſtitutions, and Diſciplines themſelves, do alſo promiſe humility, and ſeem to be ſo many exerciſes of it. And this is the thing, in my opinion, which the Apoſtle does particularly conſider, in this place. Look back, I pray, on the Diſciplines of thoſe Seducers, whom he oppoſeth; I mean, on thoſe abſtinencies from certain meats, and the obſervations of certain dayes; doth it not ſeem, that this was an exerciſing of men unto humility, ſince it was a bounding of their liberty, and a degrading them from the power they had; to diſpoſe of theſe things at their pleaſure? Adding withal, that in general, whoever ſubjecteth man to a law of his, doth humble, and abaſe him, putting a new yoke upon his neck, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the thing, that he commandeth, in other reſpects be. The ſame mark of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility does appear, in the greateſt part of the Voluntary devotions, that are in vogue, whether it be among <hi>Pagans,</hi> or among <hi>Turks,</hi> or among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> themſelves. For they all in a manner, do reduce, the habit, and feeding of their Devoto's to a low, and an abject form, and ſuch as is of ſmall eſteem among men; and oblige them to things, that ſeem to vilify, and in ſome ſort diſgrace our nature.

Their food doth wear the ſame livery; and you know, there is at this day an infinit number, who to deſcend unto the loweſt degree of meanneſs, do bind themſelves by an expreſs vow to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicity, or beggery; though GOD by expreſs order forbad it his people;

It's ſufficient for their deſign, that this ſtrickes the eye, For there being nothing more natural unto man, than the deſire of honour, and the paſſion of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and appearing, and of ſhewing every way, both in perſon, and in cloathing, and in dyet, the marks of ſome eminency, and advantage above others: one can hardly look, without admiration, upon people, who ſeem to renounce all this; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when they are perſons, born, and bred in ſuch conditions, as afforded them the means of poſſeſſing all theſe advantages at their deſire. This without doubt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates a great prejudice for their Doctrine, and makes it to be favourably received; it ſeeming not poſſible, either that perſons, who ſo voluntarily deveſt themſelves, of what others moſt earneſtly ſeek after, ſhould not be moved by a good Spirit; or that Doctrines, which tend to humble our haughty, and proud nature, ſhould be other, than holy, and ſalutiferous.</p>
                     <p>The remains the laſt of thoſe three colours, that enter the compoſition of the paint of humane Doctrines, which is, in a manner, the deepeſt, and gives them the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gloſs; namely, that (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>they do not at all ſpare the body, and have not any regard to the ſatisfying of the fleſh.</hi> It is clear, and confeſſed on all hands, that he ſpeaks of the Auſterity, and Rigour, which theſe Seducers made ſhew of, as well in their lives, as in their Doctrine, beating down their bodies, and giving them hard uſage, without having any great care to content their deſires. All are at accord, that this in groſs, the Apoſtle's ſcope, and ſenſe; as indeed his words do neceſſarily, and clearly ſignifie. But when it comes to the ranking of them, and the conſtruing
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50919:154"/>of each of them in particular, there doth ſome difficulty appear, which hath cauſed diverſity of thoughts among Expoſitors. The difficulty doth preciſely reſpect the latter clauſe alone, and have not any regard to the ſatiating of the fleſh, inſtead whereof, it is in the Original, rendring word for word, not in any honour for the ſatiating of the fleſh. Some good, and eminent ſervants of GOD, do ſever the word honour, from the reſt, interpreting the Apoſtle, thus, they do not at all ſpare the body, in that which is for the ſatisfying of the fleſh. The honour of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in the Apoſtle's language, is its purity and honeſty, as he plainly teacheth elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 4.4.</note> ſaying, <hi>The will of GOD, even our ſanctification is, that each one ſhould know how to poſſeſs his Veſſel in Holineſs, and Honour.</hi> And to this honour he oppoſeth, in another place,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.26.</note> all the ordures, and impurities of Luxury, which he calls paſſions of diſhonour, or infamous affections, as the French Bible hath tranſlated it. Therefore it is,
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.4.</note> that he ſtileth Marriage, which was inſtituted of GOD, for the conſervation of this honour of our bodies, honourable among all. The Apoſtle then, according to the ſentiment of theſe Interpreters, doth oppoſe this honour to the Seducers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended mortifications. For to preſerve this honour, it is true, we ought not to ſpare our bodies, but religiouſly abſtain from all, that's contrary to the ſame, denying our fleſh all the pleaſures of impurity. It's for this end alone, that an ill uſage of our bodies is permitted us: whereas theſe Seducers their abſtinences were of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For the rigour they uſed towards their bodies, was to abſtain, not from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures incompatible with Sobriety, Temperance, and Chaſtity; but from certain ſorts of meat, the uſe of which no way defiles the body, nor violates, in any manner, the holineſs it ought to be kept in. This expoſition, you ſee, is good, and godly, and ſuiteth well enough with the Apoſtle's terms.</p>
                     <p>Our French Bible hath followed another, no leſs pertinent, as taking the Greek word, that properly ſignifies Honour, or Reſpect, for Having regard, they do not at all ſpare the body, and have not any reſpect, or any regard, for ſatisfying of the fleſh. For a man regards, what he doth honour, whence it comes that to honour, is often put, in Scripture, for the having a care of; as when S. <hi>Paul</hi> would command <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to have a care of Widows,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.4.</note> he ſays to him; <hi>Honour the Widows, that are Widows indeed:</hi> and ſo frequently elſewhere. In like manner therefore, he ſaith in this place, that theſe Teachers did not at all ſpare the body, and took no care of it; not valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all the things, that are requiſite, for the feeding, and ſatisfaction of the fleſh. I think, we may hold to this Expoſition, as the ſimpleſt, and eaſieſt; and indeed it is the commoneſt, and moſt followed. Theſe falſe Teachers then made, this their contempt of the body, and the ſmall care they took to nouriſh it, according to its appetites, to be ſounded out aloud; referring thereunto thoſe abſtinences from ſome kind of meats, which they enjoyned; proclaiming that this was to mortifie their fleſh, and keep it in an wholſome diſcipline. What could be ſaid more plauſible? For as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more unworthy the high deſignes of piety, than a ſticking to the things of the Carkaſs, and the Kitchin; ſo it ſeems, that there is not any thing more worthy of the things of Heaven; then contempt of this baſe, and wretched nature. And the more paſſionate ordinary men are for their fleſh, even to the making it their GOD, ſo much the more do they admire thoſe, who beat it down, inſtead of adoring it, as themſelves do. Accordingly evident it is, that moſt Seducers have abuſed this colour, to paint over their inventions, and impoſtures. We read, how the old Idol-prieſts did cut all their faces with Lancets,
<note place="margin">1 King. 18.28.</note> and other Pagans rend their Children, and Pages with ſtripes, before the Altar of their feigned Deity: nor can one think without horrour, upon the Cruelties, and Barbarities, which the moſt part of their Prieſts, and Votaries did, and do yet to this day, exerciſe on their own perſons, in places where Paganiſm bear ſway. Their Abſtinences alſo were extream; and there were Sects, yea whole Nations, that ſcrupled to eat of any thing, that had had ſence. The Faſtings, and Auſterities of the Encratites, the Montaniſts, and Euſtathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ancient Hereticks of the Chriſtian Profeſſion, are famous in the Writings of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. Not ſo much as the Mahumetans, the moſt ſenſual, and moſt carnal of all Infidels, but do make ſemblance of not ſparing their bodies. I paſs by the prodigious, and incredible auſterities of their Votaries, of whom, ſome go almoſt ſtark naked, and ſo little ſpare their fleſh, that they wound, and gaſh it, both with Inciſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſtions;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:50919:154"/>others neither eat, nor drink, but very ſeldom. Even all Mahometans in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral do moſt devoutly obſerve every Year a kind of Lent, which they call <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>edan,</hi> Faſting daily an whole month from Morning untill night, without taking any thing at all, untill the Starrs appear. Every one knows alſo, how ſcrupulouſly they all abſtain from Wine, one of the pleaſingſt, and moſt prized refreſhments of the body.</p>
                     <p>But for theſe people, who are without any knowledge of the Apoſtle's Authority, Beloved Brethren, it is no wonder, they ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be ſeduced by ſuch vain ſhews. Our amazement, and grief is on the occaſion of our Adverſaries of the Roman Communion, that this falſe luſtre, ſo loudly decryed here by an Apoſtle, whom they profeſs to acknowledge, and reverence, ſhould yet be ſufficient to recommend unto them Doctrines purely humane, and cauſe them to receive them for Divine. For I may truly ſay, that all their errours, or wanting very few, have been introduced, by favour of three falſe colours, which the Apoſtle doth here ſo roughly reject: to wit, voluntary ſervice, humility, and mortifying of the body. And they are not aſhamed to recommend them ſtill by theſe very things, alledging, for the defence of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, ſuch ſhews, as Pagans, Hereticks, and Infidels have heretofore painted over their impieties, and ſuperſtitions withall, and the Apoſtle expreſly remarked, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the abuſe of. It's by this, that they defend, the worſhipping of Images, and the Invocation of Saints, and the exorbitant ſubmiſſion they live in unto the Prelats, and particularly to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the celebration of ſo many Feſtivals, and a multitude of other abuſes. Not being able to found them on the Scriptures of GOD, they plead to us, that they are voluntary ſervices, which are performed with a good intention and do tend to humble the Spirit. Their Faſtings and Abſtinences, their Watchings, and Pilgrimages, their Whippings, and Diſciplines, and all the odd exerciſes of their Monks, are not in the leaſt commanded of GOD. But what skills it? The more voluntary they are, (ſay they) the more meritorious; and then on the other hand, they mortifie the body, which they ſpare not at all, having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the ſatisfying of its deſires. There's nothing, but they might make paſs for good and godly, with this ſpecious pigment. I might juſtly plead againſt theſe vain pretexts; that GOD's will ought to be the rule of ours, and that it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to truſt our intentions in matter of Religion; ſeeing it often comes to paſs, that GOD hath that in abomination, which does moſt pleaſe our thoughts: as alſo that it is a proud, and an extravagant humility, to give men a power over our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which it is the prerogative of GOD alone to have; and that if the not ſparing of the body, do ſerve for the mortifying of it, it follows not, that we muſt place divine ſervice therein. I might alledge theſe, and many other things, and found them by the Scripture, to demonſtrate the vanity of their pretexts. But for this time, I content me with the Apoſtle's example, and authority. He acknowledgeth, that the Doctrines of thoſe Seducers, whom he doth oppoſe, had theſe three very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; and that the ſame gave them a ſhew of wiſdom. And yet for all this, he doth not forbear to reject them, making ſo little account of that ſhew of theirs, that he vouchſafes not to ſpend one word upon the refutation of it. How ſpecious ſoever their Doctrines be, it's enough for his condemning them, that they were inſtituted, and taught by men, and not by the LORD; clearly preſuppoſing by this procedure of his, that all Chriſtians ſhould hold it for an undoubted maxime, that Religious ſervice muſt be meaſured by the will of GOD, and not by ours; by His order, and not our phanſie; and that the foundation of our humility is, the reſpect we owe him, not to ſubmit our Conſciences to any beſides Him. Let then the Traditions of <hi>Rome,</hi> in other regards, be of what quality you pleaſe; let them have all the colours of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; let them be voluntary, and humble, and meet to mortifie the fleſh. You will do much by ſetting all this pompous ſhew in view. You will gain much, by laying it forth before mine eyes, and declaiming to me of the advantages of thoſe things. I cannot receive them, except you ſhew me, that it is GOD hath inſtituted them, and not the will of man. The Apoſtle hath taught me, to make ſo little account of theſe kind of reaſons, as that I ſhould not vouchſafe ſo much, as to amuſe my ſelf to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. After having heard you, it ſufficeth me to tell you, as he ſaith here to the Seducers of his time, that if your Doctrines have this ſhew of wiſdom, which you attribute to them, they are in concluſion, but humane things, ſince GOD hath not at all commanded them in His word.</p>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:50919:155"/>
                     <p>Yet upon thorough examination, it will be found, My Brethren, that the moſt of their inventions do want, not the reality alone, but the colour, and the very ſhew of wiſdom. For, I beſeech you, what ſhadow of wiſdom is there, in this Lent for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which they began the other day, after the ordinary Preface of their Carneval? What reaſon, or common ſenſe is there, that can affirm, if it be free, that it is wiſdom, after licenſe taken for all kind of debauches, and fooleries, to imagine an handful of aſhes will efface it all? That it is wiſdom to believe, the eating of Fiſh is faſting? That it is wiſdom to think, the eating Herbs, or Salmon, or Green-fiſh, is a ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones ſelf? and that to taſte but a bit of Bief, or Mutton, during theſe forty days, is to defile ones ſoul with a ſin mortal, and meriting eternal fire? as if the whole nature of things were changed in a moment, and the living Creatures of the earth, from being good, and wholſome, as they were but four dayes ago, became contagious, and deadly? Is it wiſdom, to tye up Chriſtianity to an obſervance, which hath ſo little reaſon in it, and to ſay, as they do, that ſuch, as eat any fleſh, within this time are not Chriſtians? There is no underſtanding how ordinary ſoever, but may eaſily judge, that all this hath no ſhew of wiſdom in it, to ſay no worſe. And it is to no purpoſe, to tell us, that it's not the nature of the things themſelves, but the commandment of their Church, that makes them be of this opinion. For if theſe things be not true in themſelves, their Church does ill to authorize them, and beſides that it contravenes the rules of wiſdom, evidently violates thoſe of charity alſo, as ſtraitning the way to Heaven, and augmenting the difficulty of entring there, and damning men for things, which without its commandment, would be free, and indifferent.</p>
                     <p>Let us lay aſide then, I beſeech you, my Brethren, all theſe humane Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are ſo far from being juſt, and neceſſary, that they have not, for the moſt part, ſo much as that vain ſhew of wiſdom, which the Apoſtle granted, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Seducers of his time, had. Hold we to the Sacred, and ſaving inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of our LORD JESUS; which all are juſt, all reaſonable, all full of deep,
<note place="margin">Mat. 16.11.</note> and truly Divine wiſdom. Let us believe, as he hath taught us, that <hi>'tis not what enters in at the mouth, that doth defile a man, but what cometh out of the heart:</hi> and that <hi>the Kingdom of GOD,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> 
                        <hi>is not meat or drink; but righteouſneſs, peace, and joy of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Serve we Him, according to His own rule, and not according to the imaginations of men. Let our will be bound up to His; let it count it ſelf happy in following the ſame, and not preſume to guide it ſelf. Let it learn of Him, what it oweth Him,; not be ſo arrogant, as to define it after its own phanſie. The task, He hath given us, is great enough, for our employing all the time, and ſtrength we have, without diverting ought of the ſame any other way. It's in this, that true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility conſiſts, even in ſubmitting abſolutely to JESUS CHRIST; in refuſing no particular of what He would have; in attempting nothing beyond His orders. He it is clear, would have us to love GOD with all our heart, and our Neighbour as our ſelves: and that <hi>denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and godly in the preſent world, looking for His glorious appearance.</hi> This Beloved Brethren, is the rule of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD, that was delivered by JESUS CHRIST; Preached by His Apoſtles, confirmed by their Miracles, and by the Converſion of the World. <hi>Peace, and Mercy be to all that ſhall follow it.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe Sermons will not be new to You; there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſt ſo little time, ſince you heard them at</hi> Charenton, <hi>no doubt but you will know them at firſt ſight. The ſupport they then found in our holy Aſſembly, emboldens them now to preſent themſelves in publick. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it had been better, to rest contented with that favour, which our people ſhew'd them, and not publiſh them once more in this other form. For beſide, that the eye is much more delicate than the ear, and the defects of a diſcourſe are far more eaſily obſerv'd on paper, where they abide, than in the air, where they do but paſs; there is further a great difference between an Auditor, whom devotion doth oblige to hear you, and a Reader, who does owe you nothing. The one would think, he ſhould ſin againſt Piety, if he deny'd you his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The other doth you a favour, in heeding you, and may examine you, without a crime. The one's judgment is half made for you; whereas the other's is at its full liberty. Theſe reaſons would have with-held me, from hazarding the editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe ſmall Books, if the matter had wholly depended upon my opinion. But the deſires of my friends, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of the Book-ſeller interpoſing in it, their violence hath forc'd my modeſty. Yet I ſhould have had vigour, and firmneſs enough, to defend my ſelf againſt it, if the question
<pb facs="tcp:50919:157"/>had been ſimply of my ſelf, and my reputation. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age being ſo polite, and ſo illuminated, as the moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent tongues, and the beſt faſhioned penns can hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it; I well know, that to pleaſe it, there is need of graces, and perfections, which I do not poſſeſs. But neither is that, the thing I ſeek: ſince of my weakneſs, and the Calling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with GOD hath honoured me, having competently ſecured me from ſuch a paſſion. That which made me yield, to the too favourable will of my Friends, is the intereſt of Chriſtian ſouls, which they laid before me, and the ſervice, they believ'd, this Book might do them. The ſucceſs will inform us, whether they had reaſon to promiſe themſelves ſo much from it. For my part, the thing being as yet uncertain, I held my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, to give place unto their judgment, and to prefer the profit, which they imagine the faithful may receive from my poor labours, before any other conſideration. And if it be temerity, to hope the ſame; at leaſt it is not a crime, but a laudable affection to deſire it. Of one thing, Sir, I am well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh aſſured; that you will not diſlike the gift, I make you, of this third, and laſt part of my work. For to ſay nothing of that ſweetneſs of ſpirit, and that obliging nature, which every one obſerves in you; and not to conſider divers teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which I have received, of your good will towards me in particular, I am confirm'd in this opinion, by your piety, well known in our Church, both by the excellent fruits of your charity, in the ordinary courſe of your life, and by the ſervices, you have ſometime done our whole flock, in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an Elder, while you executed it among us, with much edification, and praiſe. Perſwading my ſelf therefore, Sir, may it pleaſe you, that you will receive this ſmall preſent, with your uſual goodneſs, and facility; there remains not elſe, but that I pray GOD to conſerve you, with your worthy, and well-born Family in health, and proſperity, daily augmenting on you His moſt precious bleſſings, both ſpiritual, and temporal. I beſeech you, to continue me the honour of your good graces, and to do me the favour to believe, that I paſſionately am,</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ear Brethren; If the ſtudy and practiſe of true holineſs, which conſiſts in the love of God, and our Neighbour, had filled, as it ought, the hearts and lives of Chriſtians, they would never have amus'd themſelves in thoſe minute devotions, and carnal ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, wherewith ſuperſtition hath alwaies fed, and doth ſtill to this day feed the World. This ſecond ſort of ſervices was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and introduced in Religion, but to be a ſupply in defect of the other: For man well knowing, that the Majeſty and Beneficence of GOD obligeth us to ſerve Him; and the charms and tentations of the earth turning away his heart
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50919:158"/>from the legitimate ſervice we owe Him, which is that of a true and real ſanctity; that he may not appear empty in the preſence of this ſoveraign Deity, he preſents it inſtead of that which it requireth of us, with certain corporeal, childiſh, and ſpurious devotions, which, for that they are of our own invention, are naturally pleaſing to us. Accordingly, they are commonly called ſatisfactions; becauſe they are performed to content GOD, and pay Him for the omiſſion of what was due to Him: An evident ſign, that if men had fulfill'd their duty, there would have been no need of their buſying themſelves in theſe other exerciſes. Hence there proceeded, at the beginning, thoſe abſtinences from certain meats, and thoſe diſtinctions of daies, and that worſhipping of Angels, which ſome ſeducers would have ſet up among Chriſtians, in the very daies of the Apoſtles. From the ſame ſource alſo iſſued afterward, the ſtations, the xerofagies, and other diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines of the Montaniſts, and of divers hereticks, that ſometime diſturbed the ancient Church. In fine, from this very original have ſprung the obſervances, and voluntary ſervices of <hi>Rome;</hi> thoſe Orders and Rules of ſo many Monks, as do now a-daies fill the World; quadrageſimal rites, faſts and vigils, auricular confeſſion, pilgrimages, whippings, feaſtivals, jubilees, chappelets, and fraternities, with a multitude of ſuch other devotions, which have overwhelmed Chriſtian Religion. We may confidently ſay, there would never have been recourſe to ſuch things, if mortification of the old man, if true piety towards GOD, and true charity towards their neighbour, had exerciſed, and continually taken up the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and whole life of Chriſtians. So likewiſe you ſee their greateſt Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots confeſs, that their rules and diſciplines have no place in Heaven, where ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is perfected; and never had leſs on earth, than among Chriſtians of the firſt age, that is, the beſt, and moſt holy; all theſe humane devotions being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſprung from a relaxing of the piety of Chriſtians, and the corruption of their manners.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> having refuted in the precedent Chapter, as you have heard, the pretended ſervices, and mortifications of the falſe Teachers of his time; that the faithful, to whom he writes, might utterly be diſguſted at, and turned away from the ſame; does now lay before them the juſt offices, and legitimate exerciſes of Chriſtian piety; the body of holineſs, inſtead of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; the ſolid doctrine of the LORD JESUS, inſtead of the vain, and childiſh leſſons of ſuperſtition; the true mortifying of the fleſh, inſtead of the ſeducers unprofitable macerations; and an abſtinence from ſin, and the luſts thereof, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of abſtinence from certain meats; in fine, Heaven, inſtead of the earth: As a prudent gardiner, who after he hath pluck'd up the bad, or unprofitable herbs of his garden, and well cleans'd the ground, caſts in good ſeeds, that are worthy to take up the earth, and capable of yielding fruits uſeful for the food of men. Withal, the Apoſtle, by this means, prevents an objection, that ſuperſtition uſually makes. For being not able to maintain its petty ſervices, as holy, and neceſſary in themſelves, it hath been wont to alledge, that whatever they be otherwaies, it is yet better for Chriſtians to employ themſelves in them, than to abide idle. The Apoſtle takes from it this vain colour, ſhewing the faithful, that they have another task, which is much more worthy, and much more noble, to wit, the ſtudy and practiſe of true ſanctity: ſo that ſuperſtition is guilty not only of a ſuperfluous diligence, but of a pernicious temerity, in diverting Chriſtians from their legitimate and neceſſary work, by thoſe voluntary exerciſes, wherewith it pretends to charge them. Let us then, Dearly beloved Brethren, keep off from the vain inſtitutions of ſuperſtition, whether ancient, or modern; and keep to the diſcipline of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Let us meditate, let us ſtudy, and practiſe what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth us; and aſſure our ſelves, that in following, and obſerving his rule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, we ſhall have neither time, nor will, nor need to buſie our ſelves after the rules of men. He employes all the remainder of this Epiſtle in theſe Divine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments; and in the beginning of this Chapter, after he hath raiſed our hearts to Heaven, he repreſents unto us, the general duties of ſanctification; that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all Chriſtians: thence paſſing unto particulars, he inſtructeth married perſons, children, fathers, ſervants and maſters, in what they owe to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50919:158"/>as you ſhall hear, if GOD pleaſe, in the ſequel of theſe actions. For the preſent, to explain the exhortation, which he hath plac'd at the head of this excellent tract, and the words whereof we have read to you, we will conſider, by the grace and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, firſt the precept, it containeth, that we do ſeek the things which are above; and then in the ſecond place, the two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon which he foundeth it; one taken from our being riſen again with CHRIST; and the other from J. CHRIST His ſitting on high, at the right-hand of GOD; and we ſhall obſerve upon each particular, as briefly as we may, the inſtructions and leſſons they afford us, either for our edification, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in general, or particularly for our preparation to that holy, and myſtical repaſt, unto which the LORD JESUS invites us againſt the next LORD'S Day.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Greeks e're-while aſcribed to that Philoſopher of theirs whom they moſt eſteemed, the glory of having brought down wiſdom from Heaven to the earth; becauſe he was the firſt that fixed the minds of his Scholars on the conſidering of their own nature, and what we owe, either to our ſelves, or to other men; whereas the Sages, that liv'd before him, buſied themſelves in nothing but the contemplating of Heaven, and its motions, and the natural things that depend upon the ſame. But the LORD JESUS, the true Prince of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Verity, inſtructs us quite otherwiſe than that man did, who verily was but a blind leader of the blind. For all the Philoſophy of JESUS CHRIST is, to looſen us from the earth, and lift us up to Heaven, and ſo fix our minds and affections there, as we may dwell even for the preſent, and converſe, and have our ſouls inceſſantly there, how far diſtant ſo-ever our bodies be from that happy habitation. It is very true, as that poor Pagan judged, that the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating of the Sun, and the Planets, and the other Stars, and the ſearching out of their motions, and the admiring of their beauty, their light, their greatneſs, and other qualities (which was all the employment of the Heathens firſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy) doth not much conduce to the perfection of our manners, and the felicity of our lives. But neither is it upon that, that JESUS CHRIST doth fix us. He hath diſcovered to us other things, on high within that nobler part of the World, which are infinitely more excellent, and more neceſſary; and ſuch, as if that Pagan had ſeen them, he would have made no difficulty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that true wiſdom conſiſteth, not in ſtaying ones ſelf here below on the earth, but in aſcending up to Heaven, for the viewing, the loving, and admiring of them continually.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, He hath revealed to us there, an holy, and a glorious City, ſeated above nature, and all its elements; a City, not mutable, and ſubject to periſh, as inferiour things; but founded, permanent, and eternal; the ſanctuary of life, and immortality; which GOD hath builded, and in which He hath diſplayed all the wonders of His power, and wiſdom; the dwelling, place, which He hath prepared for ſuch among men, as embracing His promiſes by Faith, ſhall live here below in His fear, and obey His commandments; and where He hath alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gathered in, and conſecrated in His reſt, the ſpirits of ſuch of the faithful, as He hath fetch'd out of the preſent World. CHRIST hath made us ſee, that it is there thoſe bleſſed ones do dwell, with the armies of holy Angels; and that it's thither He went Himſelf, when He had finiſhed the work of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption upon earth. It's in this myſtical Paradiſe, that the true Tree of Life doth grow. It's there, that the rivers of pleaſure do run. There ſhineth the true Sun, that never ſets. There are kept thoſe divine flowers, that can neither be fouled, nor fade, with which the piety, and patience of Saints ſhall be one day crowned. It's there, that GOD manifeſteth himſelf to His ſervants, and ſhews them the mervails of His countenance unveiled: and feeds them, and fills them with joy, and transforms them, by this viſion, into ſo many living images of His eternal, and bleſſed nature. It's there, is true glory, and true pleaſure; an honour, a felicity, and a magnificence, the idea whereof never entred, either into our ſenſes, or into the very thoughts of our heart: in compariſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all the pomp of the Earth, and the glory of this Heaven, in which we ſee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50919:159"/>the Sun and the Stars go their rounds, is but a ſhadow, and a vapour. Again, as the creatures there poſſeſs true glory, ſo do they exerciſe true ſanctity: All of it, that's ſeen here below, is but a little ſparkle of the perfection of thoſe bleſſed inhabitants of that coeleſtial City. The love they bear to their LORD, is there perfect, as well as the knowledge they have of Him. Charity towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, concord, union, truth, do there reign abſolute. Their ſouls have neither affections, nor deſires, but which are conform unto the will of GOD. The light of his face governeth all their motions, and ſhedding abroad its ſelf continually upon them, maintains them in an eternal holineſs, peace and bleſſedneſs. The LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS hath diſcovered to us all theſe wonders above the Heavens, having brought life and immortality to light by the Goſpel. But further, He hath certified us to, that theſe are things which concern us, and pertain to us? and opened, by His croſs, and reſurrection, the way that will moſt aſſuredly bring us to them. If we have the courage to follow Him, of what condition or quality ſo-ever we may be, He will congregate us to this holy company of His ſervants; receiving our ſouls into His boſome, upon their departure from this earth, and raiſing up our poor bodies themſelves one day, reveſted with His immortality and His glory.</p>
                     <p>Theſe be, Dear Brethren, the things which are above, that the Apoſtle wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth we do ſeek; in the ſame ſenſe that our Saviour commands us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<note place="margin">Matth. 6.33.</note> to ſeek the Kingdom of GOD, and His righteouſneſs; ſignifying by that term, Firſt, that we propoſe Heaven and Eternity to our ſelves, for the utmoſt end of our whole life, and place our ſupreme happineſs in this rich poſſeſſion; that we make it our grand, and only deſign. And ſecondly, that we employ, in this noble perſuit, all the might we have, ſeriouſly uſing all the means that the Word of GOD preſcribeth us, faith, invocation, piety, ſanctity; and flee as a mortal peſt, every thing that keeps us off, or turneth us aſide from this mark. For,
<note place="margin">Prov. 21.25.</note> as to the ſlothful, who does nothing all day but deſire, and ſets not his hand to the work, he hath no part in thoſe heavenly things. His deſire kills him, ſaith the wiſe man; as one that feeds on nothing but wind; there muſt be knocking; there muſt be ſeeking; there muſt be working out our ſalvation with fear and trembling. This treaſure is not for cold and languid wills, that evaporate alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in vain wiſhings. It ſhall be that man's prize, who ſhall take it with an ardent, and a generous courage; and impulſed with a violent affection, ſpare neither pain, nor watching, nor labour to obtain it.</p>
                     <p>That which the Apoſtle commandeth us in the following verſe, namely, to mind the things which are above, doth amount to well-neer the ſame ſenſe. For the word he uſeth, comprehends the two actions of our ſouls towards objects we love; the one, a conſidering them, and thinking on them; the other; a deſiring, and embracing them in our affections. So you ſee, he obligeth us, firſt, to liſt up our hearts to Heaven, where the LORD JESUS is, and to have that bleſſed Kingdom continually before our eyes, which GOD hath there prepared for us, together with all thoſe great eternal good things wherein it conſiſteth. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that this thought do fill our ſouls day and night; that it be the thought that hath ſuperiority in them, that governs all the motions of them; the thought that regulateth our reſolutions, and decideth all our doubts. That in all things which ſhall preſent themſelves, we ever reflect hereon, to ſee how they refer unto it, and whether they be compatible with it. Such was the practiſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithful. He looked (ſaith the Apoſtle) for a City that hath founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And <hi>Moſes,</hi> the grand legiſlator of the Jews, He had regard (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle) unto the recompence; that is, as he explains himſelf in the Text, They minded the things which are above. And this thought (as you ſee) is alſo neceſſarily conjoynt with affection; with an ardent deſire of poſſeſſing ſuch amiable and excellent things, and with a ſtedfaſt hope of enjoying them at length.</p>
                     <p>This is then, my Brethren, the firſt of thoſe two duties which the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us, to wit, that we ſeek the things which are above. Now unto it he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth a prohibition, which follows neceſſarily from it, namely, that we ſeek not the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50919:159"/>things which are upon the earth; Heaven and earth being ſo oppoſite, as it is is not poſſible, but they who ſeek the things of the one, muſt renounce the things of the other. The things of the earth are, as you know, the goods of the World, riches, gold, ſilver, honours, pleaſures, and the like; all that which earthly men, the children of this generation do eſteem, and paſſionately love. He does not mean we ſhould have no care at all about the neceſſaries of the preſent life; for the good things that refer thereto, being gifts of GOD, which we cannot be without, one may both acquire, and ſerve himſelf of them with thankſgiving, yet not cleave unto them, and uſe them, yet not abuſe them. And the Apoſtle you know, other-where commands us to have care of our families, and to do every one his own buſineſs, and to labour with our hands, that we may carry our ſelves honeſtly towards them that are without, and that we may have lack of nothing. But he forbids us to ſeek the things of the earth, in the ſame ſenſe that he commanded us to ſeek thoſe of Heaven: that is, to place our chief good in them, and to deſire them with choiceſt affection, and prefer them before any other conſideration. It's thus that thoſe men ſought the things of the earth,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.12. Luke 14.</note> of whom the Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere, that the belly was their God, and they gloried in their ſhame; and thoſe in the Goſpel-parable, who preferred the care of their fields, and of their oxen, and the love of their wives, before the call of Heaven. Such a one, in the Old Teſtament, was that <hi>Eſan,</hi> who choſe a little pottage of lentils, rather than his primogeniture. Such, in the New, were thoſe ſordid Gada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens, who would have the Son of GOD be gone, becauſe He had made them loſe their ſwine; and thoſe that love their fathers, or mothers, or brethren, or other alliances, or their worldly poſſeſſions more than the LORD JESUS; or that prefer the praiſe of men before the praiſe of GOD. Such a one alſo was that beſotted rich man, who thought himſelf happy enough, becauſe he had goods laid up for many years, and dreamt of nothing but enjoying them.</p>
                     <p>Now, though the bare dignity of heavenly things, and the meer meanneſs and unprofitableneſs of earthly things, ſhould be ſufficient to recommend the former, and to diſguſt us at the latter; yet the Apoſtle, for the ſwaying of us to duties ſo juſt as theſe, ſets before us two excellent reaſons, the firſt whereof is drawn from our reſurrection with our Saviour. He had touched it already, in the twelfth verſe of the precedent Chapter; and 'tis from thence he reſumes it, and reminds us of it here, ſaying, If then ye be riſen again with CHRIST; that is to ſay, ſince you are riſen again with the LORD, as I have ſaid, and ſhewed a-fore. For the particle, if, is uſed here, as often elſe-where by way of illation, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, not in way of doubting; and imports as much, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, ſince that, or ſeeing that. For the reſt, you plainly ſee, that the Reſurrection he ſpeaks of, is not that of our bodies, which ſhall not be till the laſt day; but another myſtical, and ſpiritual one, already accompliſhed in us, by the virtue of our LORD'S reſurrection, and the efficacy of His Spirit.
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.5.6.</note> He ſpake of it a-fore, at the place we noted; and in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where he ſaith, that GOD hath quickened us together with CHRIST, and raiſed us up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Him. He explains us the myſterie of it elſe-where, in theſe words.
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>We are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>buried with Him by Baptiſme into His death, that as CHRIST is raiſed from the dead, by the glory of the Father, ſo we in like manner ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi> Every reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection preſuppoſeth a death preceding. For to riſe again, is nothing elſe, but for one to be reſtored to life, who before was dead. Now the eſtate that men are in, under the dominion of ſin, the Scripture calleth Death, becauſe therein they have no ſenſe nor motion, in reſpect of piety and ſanctity; no more than the dead that reſt in the grave, have any for the actions of this life.
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Ye were dead in your ſins and offences</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſpeaking of the time of their ignorance.) Whence is that which our Saviour ſaith in the Goſpel; <hi>Let the dead bury their dead:</hi> and which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.6.</note> 
                        <hi>the widow that liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe liveth.</hi> When therefore by the efficacy of the vocation of the Spirit, and Goſpel of the LORD, a man comes to paſs out of this miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition into the eſtate of grace; receiving the light of Faith into his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50919:160"/>and Charity and Sanctification into his heart; the Scripture, to expreſs this wonderful change, ſaith, that he is riſen again. This is preciſely the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that St. <hi>Paul</hi> intendeth in this place.</p>
                     <p>He ſaith, that we are riſen again with CHRIST; Firſt, becauſe this bleſſed change that's brought to paſs in us by His grace, is like that change which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tided Him, when from the grave, where He had lain for the ſpace of three daies, He was raiſed unto life by virtue from on high. For as He then received the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of moving, and ſenſation, of which He was deprived in the Sepulchre: ſo we, in our regeneration, do receive a ſpirit, and a principle of life, which we had not before. Again, as the LORD was reſtored unto life by the glory of the Father, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, that is by virtue of the exceeding great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power of GOD; in like manner are we renew'd, and put into the ſtate of grace, by the efficacy of the might of GOD, and not by the arm of man, or the operation of fleſh and blood. In fine, as the LORD, upon His riſing again, did recover, not ſimply that life which He laid down in His dying, but another much more excellent and glorious, a ſpiritual, a coeleſtial and an immortal life: in like manner we reſume in our regeneration, not the life of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> before ſin, from which we were fallen, and which how excellent ſo-ever, was nevertheleſs animal, and mortal, that is, capable of being loſt, as appeared by the iſſue: but another much more exquiſite and perfect, a life eternal, immutable, and like that the bleſſed Angels live. Thus you ſee, the Reſurrection of the LORD CHRIST is the idea and pattern of ours. But I add in the ſecond place, that we are ſaid to be riſen again with CHRIST, becauſe it is in Him, and from Him, that we have this grace; it being evident, that Faith, which is the firſt faculty of the new life, doth ingraff and incorporate us into JESUS CHRIST, and as the vine-branch doth not live, but in its ſtock; ſo man cannot live that divine life, but in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                     <p>In fine, we are riſen again with CHRIST, becauſe His reſurrection is the cauſe of ours; in ſuch ſort, as if He had not riſen from the dead, we ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained lying in the darkneſs of our ſpiritual death. CHRIST coming forth out of His grave, hath opened, and enlightened ours, and hath adminiſtred out of His own ſtore, all things neceſſary to deliver us out of the miſerable eſtate wherein we were, and to put us in poſſeſſion of the life of Heaven. His reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection hath founded our Faith, ſhewing us clearly that He is the Son of GOD, and that His Goſpel is true. His reſurrection hath aſſured our ſouls, giving us full proof, that His death did fully ſatisfie and content the judge of the World. It hath ſtrengthened our hopes, making us to ſee by example of our Head, that death, the dreadfulleſt of our enemies, cannot impede our happineſs. Hereupon it hath kindled love of GOD, and deſire of ſo great glory in our hearts; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, produced in them the principles, the habitudes, and diſpoſitions of the new life, which are neceſſary for our attaining unto bliſsful immortality. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore JESUS CHRIST in riſing again, did thereby raiſe up our life, which had been ingulfed in hell, and the curſe, and brought to light the cauſes of Faith, Hope, and Charity, the principal faculties of that new life we now have; it's evident that we are riſen again in Him, and with Him. From whence, that which the Apoſtle infers upon it, doth no leſs clearly follow, to wit, that we ought to mind henceforth the things which are on high, and ſeek them with all our affection. For the life unto which we are raiſed up with our LORD, is heavenly, and not earthly; divine, and not natural; eternal, and not corruptible. Since therefore every creature employeth all the ſenſe and affection it hath, about things ſuitable to its life; who ſees not, that the faithful are obliged, by the honour they have to be riſen again with the LORD, neither to breath after, nor embrace other things, but thoſe that are on high, in which their new life doth properly conſiſt? And ſuch is the example He hath given us. For being riſen, he abode but a very little time here below, only ſo long as the work of our ſalvation did require; and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with aſcended into Heaven, to draw up our thoughts and affections thither, untill our bodies alſo follow one day, being raiſed up thither, as His was, unto higheſt glory.</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50919:160"/>
                     <p>And this is the ſecond conſideration that the Apoſtle here lays before us, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us unto ſo juſt a duty. <hi>Seek the things which are above, where CHRIST</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſitteth at the right hand of GOD. For</hi> it (as our LORD ſometime ſaid) <hi>where our treaſure is there be our hearts alſo;</hi> where ſhould our ſouls be but in Heaven, ſince it is in that bleſſed dwelling place that their treaſure doth reſide? JESUS, their good, their life, and their joy, in whom is hidden all our felicity? In time paſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, the faithful alwaies turned their eyes and thoughts towards the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe it was the abiding place of the pledges of GOD's covenant with them, and of the moſt precious ſymbols of His preſence and glory. Judge what our affection and earneſtneſs ſhould be for Heaven, which containeth the true Ark of GOD, where all the fulneſs of His Godhead dwelleth, not in ſhadow, and figure, but really, and bodily? But there is more yet; JESUS CHRIST is our Head, and we His members. How can we conſerve this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but in keeping cloſe to Him, and following Him faithfully, without ever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from Him, or withdrawing from that Sanctuary where He dwelleth? And indeed, He expreſly aſſures us in the Goſpel, that <hi>He willeth we ſhould be where He is;</hi> and that <hi>where the dead body is, there alſo the Eagles gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;</hi> ſo as if we be truly of the number of His Eagles, it is not poſſible but we ſhould take our flight to Heaven, ſince this divine body of our LORD and Saviour is there.</p>
                     <p>And hereby you ſee, dear Brethren, to note it by the way, how diſtant the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is from that of <hi>Rome.</hi> For whereas the Apoſtle elevateth our hearts from earth to Heaven, <hi>Rome</hi> brings them down, as far as in her lyeth, from Heaven to the earth, faſtning the hearts of her zealots, on her material altars and ciboires, which, ſhe pretends, the LORD is encloſed in; againſt the ſuffrage of the whole Church, who hath ever conſtantly applied theſe words of the Apoſtle, particularly to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, exhorting the faithful, when they celebrate it, to have their hearts above. Sure, if JESUS CHRIST be here below, as <hi>Rome</hi> would have it, the Apoſtle does ill, to command us <hi>to mind the things which are above:</hi> and worſe again, in urging for a reaſon of it, that it's above that JESUS CHRIST reſideth. If for that the LORD is in Heaven, we ought, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtles inſtruction, not to ſeek any thing on earth; how much leſs, I beſeech you, ought we to ſeek the LORD Himſelf there? I do not adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you, that this is to be underſtood of the preſence of the humane nature of JESUS CHRIST; For you know, that He is every where, as to the eſſence, and providence of His Divinity; And as to the grace of His Spirit, and the efficacy and virtue of His will and inſtitutions, we readily confeſs, that the ſame is not confined to the Heavens; and doth extend, and ſhew its ſelf whereſoever He pleaſeth, according to the promiſe He hath made us, to be in the midſt of us, when we are aſſembled in His Name.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle doth not barely ſay, that JESUS is in Heaven. He adds, that <hi>He ſitteth at the right hand of GOD.</hi> Divers Doctors have belaboured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much in the explicating of theſe words; and at length, there are ſome that have ſtrangely diſguiſed them; as if they ſignified, that our LORD's humane nature had been inveſted with all the properties of the Divinity, which would be no other thing, but that it was transform'd into a Divine nature; a conceit which all true Chriſtians have horrour for, confeſſing that the two natures do remain, each of them in its integrity, having been united in JESUS CHRIST, but not blended together, nor confuſed; The Apoſtle, if we pleaſe to hear him, will tell us in two words what it is to ſit at the right hand of GOD. For in the 15th. Chapter of the firſt Epiſt. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſpeaking of the eſtate, to which JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST hath been exalted in the Heavens, and in which he ſhall abide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly unto the end; inſtead of its being ſaid by the Prophet, from whom the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion was taken, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. that the LORD ſhould fit at the right hand of the Father; he ſaith ſimply, that He ſhall reign till He hath put all His enemies under His feet; an evident ſign, that this ſitting at the right hand of the Father, is nothing elſe, but that ſupreme dominion which hath been given Him over all things, and which He doth, and ſhall exerciſe unto the end of all ages; inaſmuch
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50919:161"/>as GOD hath made Him LORD,
<note place="margin">Acts 2.36.</note> and CHRIST, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks. And this conſideration doth again mightily ſtrengthen the holy Apoſtle's exhortation. For ſince Heaven is the throne, on which the Prince of the Univerſe doth ſit, and from which He diſpenſeth, and governeth all things at His will; there is great reaſon we ſhould turn our eyes thither-ward, and have this Royal Court of our Soveraign in mind night and day, to comfort our ſelves under the trouble, that either the iniquity of men and devils, or the intemperateneſs of other creatures, does give us, and to form our manners, and all the parts of our life, after the will, and by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſo great, and ſo holy a Monarch.</p>
                     <p>Behold the Leſſon, Beloved Brethren, which the Apoſtle gives us at this time, that <hi>we ſeek not low, but high things; not thoſe of the earth, but the things of Heaven; ſince we are riſen up with JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, who is ſat down on high, in Heaven, at the right hand of GOD.</hi> What would there be in all the World more happy than we, if we took up a good and a firm reſolution to obey Him, and practiſe the thing He enjoyneth us? Theſe fears, and theſe deſires, and ſo many other vain paſſions which trouble our whole life, would have no more place in us. We, elevated far above that, which men unprofitably covet, or poſſeſs, or apprehend, ſhould, with Angels, enjoy a Divine contentment. From that glorious Heaven, where we ſhould be, we ſhould deſpiſe the vanities and variations of the earth, and ſee its ſeaſons paſs on, and its elements roul about, and its idols periſh, and its pleaſures fleet away, without any perturbation, being ſecure, that none of its ſtorms can ever reach that high and inacceſſible region where our hearts and lives would be. We ſhould look upon death without terrour, knowing that it could not take any of thoſe things from us, which we poſſeſs on high. We ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all the accidents of this life without emotion; becauſe they can change no part of the things we have in Heaven. The charms alſo, and illuſions of the World, would touch us as little, as its menaces, and raging; becauſe the fruition of a greater good would render us inſenſible for leſſer ones; as the preſence of the Sun puts out the ſhining of the ſtars. Being content with Heaven, and its eternity, we ſhould covet nothing more; and ſatisfied with ſo rich a portion, not envy any of the creatures, the perfections, and happineſs they have. Our whole life would be a perpetual feaſtival, whereon, free from the travail and turmoil of worldlings, contemplating in ſpirit the glory of the Palace of our LORD, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating His promiſes, breathing after His benefits, and enjoying them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by faith, and Hope, we ſhould, in repoſe, wait for the bleſſed day of our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious triumph.</p>
                     <p>But alas! how far are we from ſuch a felicity! This wretched and periſhing earth is the ſole object of our minds. Our ſouls are no leſs faſtned to it than our bodies. It ſwalloweth up all our thoughts; it poſſeſſeth our affections; it takes up our cares, and our labours; and hath the uſe of all our time. We have no deſires, and love, but for the falſe goods, which it ſheweth us; nor fear and horrour, but for the evils wherewith it threatneth us. As for Heaven, and the things it comprehendeth, we are ſo far from ſeeking them, that we not ſo much as think of them, except it be dreamingly, or in manner of a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, when we are told of them in this place; looking on the ſtately repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations which JESUS CHRIST hath drawn us of them, as an empty picture; fair indeed, and pleaſing, but good for nought, ſaving to feed our eyes with a ſhort and bootleſs pleaſure; not attracting, nor engaging our deſires. This is the cauſe why our whole life is miſerable; full of griefs and fears, of weakneſſes, of regrets and infelicities. The leaſt ſtrokes overturn us; the leaſt loſſes, and ſlighteſt afflictions bear us down; becauſe not being faſtned to Heaven, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firm and ſure place of the World, we fluctuate, expoſed to the mercy of all that comes againſt us. And as children cannot be appeaſed when their pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets are taken from them, becauſe they have ſet all their affection on them: ſo are we ſeized, and do take on, when we come to loſe ſome of theſe toyes of the earth. There is no way to comfort us, becauſe we have faſtned our hearts to them. And to ſay truth, our condition is worſe than other mens; they at leaſt are ſubject but to the evils that either the infirmity of nature, or (as they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50919:161"/>call it) the inconſtancy of fortune, do bring with them; whereas beſides theſe, the bad Chriſtian, who is not a Chriſtian, but in name, is moreover expoſed to the perſecution of the World; ſo as, to ſay plainly, there is nothing more fooliſh nor more wretched than he, who hath part in the temporal ſufferings and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of true beleevers, and none at all in their conſolation or bleſſedneſs; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as his profeſſion expoſes Him to the hatred of the World, and his vice excludes him from the Kingdom of GOD.</p>
                     <p>Awake then ye that are worldly, and come once out of ſo dangerous an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Let not the trumpet of Heaven, the voice of our great Apoſtle, have founded now in your ears in vain. Do not add this contempt to your other crimes. He hath advertiſed you of your duty. He hath declared the reaſons that oblige you to it. Take heed, leſt if you ſhut your ears againſt JESUS CHRIST, who ſpeaks by His mouth, you periſh in the end with this earth, and the things you ſeek on it. How do you not perceive that you ſhall never find there the happineſs you ſeek? Why hath not the experience of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of perſons, who daily ſpend themſelves in this vain labour; taught you, that the things of the earth are all of them but vanities, and illuſions, tranſient figures, which promiſe pleaſure, honour, and contentment, but afford none? which do not cure the maladies of the body, nor of the ſoul? which infinitely toil out thoſe that ſeek them, and never fill the hearts of thoſe that poſſeſs them? multiplying their deſires, and their fears, inflaming and envenoming their paſſions, inſtead of extinguiſhing them? which are ſubject to infinite mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? which men and elements may bereave you of every moment? and which, conſidering the ſhort and uncertain duration of the life we lead here below, you can enjoy but a very little time, ſuppoſing that nothing does deprive you of them before death? At that time,

                        <hi>What will it profit a man to have gained the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> It is ſure, a blindneſs incredible, to one that ſaw it not; I do not ſay, that a Chriſtian, who hath hopes of the world to come; but that even any reaſonable man ſhould adhere with ſo ardent, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate a paſſion, unto ſuch wretched and fruitleſs things. We perceive it, and confeſs it, and make the braveſt diſcourſes in the World upon it; and after all, that falſe luſtre which we behold in theſe things, hath ſuch a faculty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch our ſenſes, that not a perſon, but lets himſelf be caught thereby. But the worſt is, that beſides errour and vanity, there's in it a tendency to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation. For men may not ſlatter themſelves. None can ſerve two Maſters; nor look on Heaven and earth both together. He that ſeeks the one, muſt of neceſſity renounce the other; it being no more poſſible to ſeek, than it's to find at once, the things beneath, and thoſe which are above.</p>
                     <p>Faithful Brethren, chooſe you, and take the better part, and leaving worldly men, to labour in vain after the things of the earth, and to ſeek in it what they ſhall never find; turn you your hearts and eyes towards Heaven, as the Apoſtle calleth you to do. There, Chriſtian, is the felicity you deſire. There dwelleth reſt, and joy, and immortality, and the perfection of both ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Theſe are the only things that are truly worthy of your prayers, and your pains. Seek them, and mind them night and day. Give your ſelves no reſt till you have found them, and do feel the firſt-fruits and beginnings of them in your hearts. Let theſe thoughts ſweeten your ſufferings, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late your loſſes. Tis in vain, that you threaten me, ye people of the World. You cannot deprive me of what I poſſeſs, nor hinder me from finding what I ſeek; ſince upon the things of Heaven, you have no power. Whatever you bereave me of, the beſt part of my treaſure, and the only part that deſerves that appellation, will ſtill remain entire to me. Let the ſame thought arm us againſt all tentations. Thou, Tempter, promiſeſt me the things of the earth; but I ſeek thoſe of Heaven, which thou canſt not diſpoſe of. Though I ſhould loſe all I have here below, even to this fleſh its ſelf, yet ſhall I find it again with a thouſand-fold increaſe in Heaven. Let this thought again keep us continually buſied in the good and worthy actions of piety, charity, and honeſty. Let our manners reſemble thoſe of the inhabitants of that divine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50919:162"/>City, which wee ſeek. Let the light of their knowledge, the ardency of their love, the purity of their affections, ſhine forth now betimes in our lives. 'Tis that, to which that new nature, JESUS CHRIST hath given us, in raiſing us again with Himſelf, doth oblige us. Theſe thoughts, and works of Heaven, are neceſſary productions of the principles and faculties of that life unto which we have been raiſed up. You can neither be Chriſtians, without having part in the reſurrection of our LORD; nor have part in His reſurrection, except you walk with Him, and wear that lightſome robe of ſanctity, wherewith He ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth all the aſſociates of His reſurrection. He Himſelf calleth us hereto from that lofty Throne, whereon He ſitteth at the right hand of GOD; Faithful ſoul, (ſaith He to each of us) look unto me, and I will give thee light. Fear not; for I govern the Heavens, and the earth. Only fix thine eyes, thy thoughts, and thine heart on me; and I will guide thee by my counſel, and receive thee one day into my glory. Dear Brethren, this He doth promiſe us, and of this He will give us earneſt next LORD's-day, at His holy table. Let us do what He demands of us, or to ſay better, let us pray Him to do it in us, and He will aſſuredly do what He promiſeth us. Unto Him, unto the Father, and unto the Holy Spirit, the true and only GOD, bleſſed for ever, be honour, praiſe, and glory, to ages of ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>

<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> Of this the Apoſtle expreſly informeth us in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſaying, that thoſe whom GOD did fore-know, that is, love, and diſcriminate from the reſt of men, according to His good pleaſure, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate really faith and eternal ſalvation unto them. He did alſo predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of His Son.
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.12, 13.</note> For this cauſe He doth us the honour to call us, ſometimes His children, and ſometimes His brethren; by reaſon of the reſemblance we have with Him; the nature, the condition, the quality, and, as 'tis commonly termed, the fortune of children following the fathers, and of brethren, being like their elder brothers. Whence the Apoſtle concludes, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that He who ſanctifyeth, that is, the LORD JESUS,
<note place="margin">Heb. 8.11.</note> and they who are ſanctified, that is, the faithful are all of one, that is, of one and the ſame maſs, of one and the ſame form and nature. And to make it plain to us, the Scripture compareth Him, ſometimes to a Vine-ſtock,
<note place="margin">Jo. 15. Rom. 11.</note> otherwhile to an Olive-tree, of each of which we are branches, all of them things, between which there is by nature a ſtrict communion; the one and the others having the ſame conſtitution and qualities. And thence again it is, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Him our firſt-fruits, when ſpeaking of our death, and the reſurrection which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50919:163"/>is to ſucceed it, he ſaith, that <hi>CHRIST was made the firſt fruits of them that ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now although this conſormity of the faithful with the LORD JESUS be of a large extent, yet it doth principally appear in two heads, wherein the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth particularly conſider it; to wit, in His Death, and in His Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; the happy remembrance whereof, we have celebrated this morning. For the death of JESUS CHRIST hath produced a death like it, in all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; reducing them, by its efficacy and virtue, unto a ſtate conform to His, when He was ſtretched out on the Croſs, and lay in the Sepulchre. In like manner His Reſurrection tranſmitteth into them, a life like that, which He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, when having overcome death, He iſſued out of His grave. His Death is not only the cauſe, but alſo the pattern of ours; and likewiſe His Life is, both the principle and exemplar of ours. It's of this death, and this life, Dearly beloved Brethren, the effect, and the image of the Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the LORD, that we make account to entertain you in this action. For after our having celebrated the memory of the death and reſurrection of this Great Saviour, and participated of the one, and the other, by the vertue of His Spirit, and our Faith; what can we more pertinently meditate, than the precious fruit which each of them produceth in us? and the images of the one, and the other of theſe myſteries, which this Divine dead, and again riſen per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> doth draw, and form in us? inaſmuch as He changeth us after a ſort into Himſelf, by an impreſſion of His omnipotent vertue; ſo as if we have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd Him, we are become dead, and riſen again with Him? St. <hi>Paui</hi> teacheth us this excellent and ſaving truth, in the ſeries of our ordinary Texts, by theſe words which we have read for the ſubject of this exerciſe. In thoſe that preceded, which we expounded eight daies ſince; this great Apoſtle drew us from the earth, that he might elevate us to Heaven, where JESUS ſitteth at the right hand of the Father; <hi>Seek,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the things which are above; and not the things which are on the earth.</hi> But becauſe he knew how difficult ſuch a tranſportation would be for perſons who are ſtill ſo many waies faſtned to the earth, to work ſo high a deſign thoroughly into us, beſides the reaſons already repreſented, which were taken from our reſurrection with the LORD, and from His preſence and glorious ſoveraignty in the places he would elevate us to; he further propoſes two more for that end, in this paſſage. The one taken from our death. For (ſaith he) ye are dead; and the other from that new life which we have received; a life hidden, it's true, for the preſent, in GOD: but ſuch as will be plainly and plenarily diſcovered one day, at the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the LORD JESUS. <hi>Your life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is hid with CHRIST in GOD. When CHRIST,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the two principal points we will treat of in this action, the grace of our LORD aſſiſting; and Him we invocate, praying, that this word of His may be effectually in us, His power to ſalvation, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changing us into the ſimilitude, both of His ſalutary death, and of His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious life; that being dead unto our ſelves, we may not live henceforth, but in Him, unto His honour, and the edification of our Brethren.</p>
                     <p>Be not aſrighted, Chriſtians, at the Apoſtle's telling you in the entrance, that <hi>ye are dead.</hi> This death which he attributeth unto you, is gain, and not loſs; a donative from GOD's grace, and not an effect of His wrath, or an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His juſtice. I grant, that every death is the privation of ſome life that was poſſeſſed. But ſince there are miſerable and execrable lives; it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that every death is not a calamity. For to be rid of a thing that harms us, is not a calamity, but a comfort. It's an advantage, and not a damage, to be deprived of a poyſon, and deveſted of an habit of malediction. The death, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, is not the deſtroying of that happy life which the Creator gave us at the beginning, to be led within Paradiſe in a continual execiſe of the original juſtice, and rectitude of our nature, and in the ſweet and innocent fruition of the goods of the firſt world. It's the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and not the ſecond, that outed us of this life; and as we did receive it in his perſon,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50919:163"/>ſo we have loſt it by his crime, being heirs of his miſery, as well as of his ſin. The life, which is extinguiſhed in us by the death here intended of the Apoſtle is that corrupted and ſin-infected life which we have received from our firſt parents by carnal generation: a life contrary to the will of GOD, and meriting His wrath, and obnoxious to His curſe: the operation of an empoyſoned na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the acting of a blind underſtanding, a perverſe will, and an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affection, the continual flux of an abominable peſt, which in the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not otherwiſe determine, than in an eternal death. It's that, which Scripture calleth <hi>the life of the old man,</hi> that is, of this altogether depraved, and corrupted nature which we derive from <hi>Adam;</hi> and which, through error in its falſe wiſdom, placing its felicity in the enjoyment of earthly things, adhereth to them with inordinate deſire, and doth not act or labour, but to acquire the ſame, purſuing them with ſuch a violent ardour, that there is not any thing ſo holy, ſo juſt, and ſo honeſt, but it violates the ſame, to attain its end. This is the life that the LORD JESUS deſtroyeth in all His true members, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of which, His holy Apoſtle ſaith, and meaneth here, that we are dead. The death, whereof he ſpeaks, is nothing elſe but the privation of this pernicious and accurſed life; the abolition of its principles, and the deſtroying of the habitudes on which it doth depend. We are dead, becauſe entring into the communion of JESUS CHRIST, we have put off this firſt life, which was natural, carnal, and terrene; and conſiſted in a perverſe and vitious re-ſearch and fruition of the periſhing things of this old world, that goeth to perdition. And this is it he teacheth us again in ſo many other places, as when he ſaith,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.14, 15, 16. Rom; 6.</note> that <hi>Old things are paſs'd away; that CHRIST having died for all, all are alſo dead, that they may not live henceforth unto themſelves:</hi> and again, <hi>We are dead with CHRIST, buried with Him by baptiſme into His death; made one and the ſame plant with Him, by the likeneſs of His death:</hi> that <hi>Our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed;</hi> and elſe-where, that <hi>they that are CHRIST's,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Col. 2.11.</note> and the <hi>putting off the body of the fleſh:</hi> the ſame again that he repreſents other-where in His own perſon, when he ſaith, that <hi>he is crucified with CHRIST;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 2.19, 20. &amp; 6.14.</note> and that <hi>it is no more himſelf that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, but CHRIST, who liveth in him;</hi> and that <hi>the world is crucified unto him, and he unto the World.</hi> And it's the ſame too, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> underſtands,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.1, 2.</note> when he ſaith, that <hi>we have ſuffered with CHRIST in the fleſh, that we ſhould live the reſt of our time in the fleſh, no more after the luſts of men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold me that penitent woman, whoſe hiſtory you have in the Goſpel; Before ſhe had ſeen the LORD, ſhe was an harlot, that liv'd in nothing but filth, and had neither action nor thought, but for the luſts of the fleſh. But after ſhe had heard the word of JESUS, and felt the efficacy of His Spirit, ſhe ſoon loſt all that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life of hers. She hath now no longer that wanton and wicked heart; thoſe unchaſte looks; thoſe impure deſires.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.6. Acts 9.1.</note> In vain ſeek you in her that debauched perſon, that liv'd in infamy before. That perſon is no more there, but is dead. The ſharpned arrows of the King of glory have penetrated her heart, and ſlain her. Behold me our <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion. He was a furious wild boar, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd unto threatnings and ſlaughter; breathing out nothing but blood, and butcheries: a murtherer animated by pride, and cruelty. Spake JESUS to him, on the way to <hi>Damaſcus?</hi> His word, like a two-edged ſword, pierced this fierce and unruly perſecutor. He ſtruck him dead, or to ſay better, deſtroyed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed him all, in a moment. Seek not <hi>Saul</hi> in him any longer, that ſo fierce, and cruel man; He's no more there. He is dead, and ſo throughly dead, that you ſhall not find in him any print of what he was before. Again, take me a view of thoſe Pagans of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> and of other places, who were converted by his miniſtery. Before they were idolaters, breaking out into all kind of vices; their life was nothing but a continual practiſe of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and impiety, of avarice, and ambition, of envy, cruelty, and injuſtice. Now, when they have paſſed through the victorious hand of the LORD JESUS, you ſee no more any ſuch thing in them. He hath extinguiſh'd in them all the life
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50919:164"/>of this kind, that they had. Thoſe idolaters, and ungodly wretches; thoſe epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, and robbers, which lived in their perſons heretofore, are all dead. They are new men of another quality, in whom, none of that they were before, remaineth any longer. In ſine, there is not one of the truly faithful, and living members of JESUS CHRIST, but hath undergone this death; the fleſh hath been ſlain in him, and the old man pierced, nailed, and crucified upon the croſs of the Son of GOD. I acknowledge, that ſo long as they are on earth, they ſtill reſent the efforts and attempts of this old man, and that combat of the fleſh luſting againſt the ſpirit,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> which the Apoſtle elſe-where ſpeaks of.</p>
                     <p>Yet I affirm, that this hinders not, but that true believers may be ſaid even for the preſent, to be dead in regard of the fleſh, and the fleſh dead in them. Firſt, becauſe ſentence of it is given in the judgement of GOD, who hath in His eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal counſel determined to extinguiſh, and aboliſh, in all the members of His Son, that firſt life which they inherited from old <hi>Adam.</hi> Secondly, becauſe the execution of this decree of GOD is begun, and advanced in them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The mortal blow thereof the fleſh receives in this life, from the hand of JESUS CHRIST, and cannot poſſibly recover it again. Then in the third place, becauſe this execution already begun in them, will not be long a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing; natural death, which, conſidering the few daies we ſpend here below, is not far from either of them, deveſting firſt their ſouls of all terrene and carnal reliques; and then the reſurrection being finally to refine their bodies alſo at the laſt day; when earthly life ſhall be entirely, and quite and clean diſſolved and deſtroyed. It's for theſe three reaſons, that the Apoſtle ſaith here and elſe-where, that the faithful are dead, in regard of the life of ſin, and of the fleſh; not that they have not in them yet ſome remainders of them: but for that this death is ordained by the decree of GOD, and already begun in them, and will ſoon be infallibly finiſhed. Even as we reckon among the dead, a malefactor whom a ſupream Court, and a ſick perſon, whom a prudent and able Phyſitian, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to dye; neither do we ſtick to ſay, that he is gone, he is dead, becauſe his death is inevitable, and all the life that remains for him, is no long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r any thing. So when a man hath been mortally wounded, we immediately rank him with the dead; becauſe his vitals are ſtruck, and all the movings and perceivings he yet hath, are but his laſt gaſpings, and the laſt combat his life makes before it doth end. It's in the ſame manner with true believers. The fleſh in them is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to death, and if it does yet ſtir, if it ſtruggle, if it give them any blow, this at moſt is a ſmall matter in compariſon of that life, it other-while exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in them. At that time it reigned in them. Now, if it do fight, yet it rules no longer. It finds a ſpirit in them which reſiſts it, which makes head againſt it; and in this, unto-it-fatal, conflict, it loſeth by little and little, all the blood and life it hath yet left it. Wherefore the LORD JESUS, whoſe death, as we have ſaid, is both the cauſe, and the pattern of ours, did not dye in an inſtant, but a lingring death, having continued five or ſix hours in an agony, before He gave up the ghoſt. It is thus, that the old man dyeth in the faithful. He is already pierced with the nails of our Saviour, and faſtned to His croſs, and in a dying eſtate, and without hope of recovery. Nevertheleſs he ſtrugleth ſtill, and will be a-while in this eſtate, loſing blood, and ſtrength, and motion, and life, not all at once, but by little and little.</p>
                     <p>This ſame is the condition of true believers: Whence appears the pernicious error of thoſe men, who having the old man, not bound, not pierced, not woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to death in them, but living, and reigning at full liberty, and with his whole vigour, do yet imagine, that they pertain to JESUS CHRIST, and are of the number of His true members. It's a mortal miſtake. JESUS owneth none for His, but ſuch as are dead with Him: whoſe fleſh is either already laid down, and deſtroyed in the grave, as theirs, who live in Heaven; or at leaſt nailed to His croſs, as theirs, who yet combat on earth. I confeſs, the preſumption of thoſe who vaunt they ſin no more, and feel no longer in themſelves any motion, or contradiction of the fleſh, is extremely vain. But your errour, worldling, is no whit leſs, who having ſin reigning, and the fleſh living in you, do not forbear
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50919:164"/>to perſwade your ſelf, that you are a true Chriſtian. If the fleſh doth ſtill breath in a true Chriſtian, if it hath ſtill ſome motion, and ſome feeling in him; yet it hath dominion in him no longer. It lives in him no longer; it languiſheth in him, and is ſo weak, as it plainly appears to be at the pangs of death. Put it into this eſtate, if you will be truly Chriſtian. Faſten it to the croſs of JESUS. Pierce it through with His nails, and with His thorns. Make it drink of His vinegar. Take from it its pleaſures; draw out its blood, and ſtrength. Again, ſince this is our condition; ſince we, by the beneficence of our Saviour, are dead, in ſuch ſort, as we even now explained; you clearly ſee, Chriſtian, that what the Apoſtle concludes upon it, doth evidently, and neceſſarily follow from it, to wit, that we ſhould not ſeek any more the things which are on earth. For ſince we have, in JESUS CHRIST, put off that carnal and vitious life, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, and welfare whereof, earthly things are ſubordinate; who is there but comprehends, that it would be an inſufferable extravagancy for us, to amuſe our ſelves ſtill about them? It would be an errour as ridiculous, as if one went an hunting after game, or a buying precious ſtones, and ſtuffs for a perſon either already dead, or at leaſt in the agony of death. Such a perſon hath no more need of thoſe things, they being good only to feed, or faſhion that li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It's juſt ſo that you, Chriſtian do, who labour ſo ardently in the ſeeking after, and acquiring of riches, honours, and other goods of the preſent World. All this is the equipage of a life, that you no longer have. The fleſh, for whoſe delight, and adornment, thoſe goods do ſerve, is dead, or at leaſt death-ſtruck in you. It is crucified with the LORD; and a crucified one hath nothing to do with meat, nor jewels, nor other things of the earth.
<note place="margin">Luke 12.20.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou fool,</hi> (ſaid our Saviour to the rich worldling in the Goſpel-parable) <hi>this very night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee, and then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt laid up?</hi> As if he had ſaid, that being once dead, he could no more enjoy them. Chriſtian, how is it you do not conſider, not only your dying e're long, but that you are (to ſay truth) dead already? that there is no carnal life for you any longer? ſo as to conclude thereupon, that you have therefore no need of all this earthly pelf, which with ſuch a deal of pain, you ſcrape together? I confeſs, that while we are on earth, we cannot altogether be without it. But neither can you deny, that for a living Chriſtianly here, we need but a little of it, and for a little time; becauſe we have little left us of that life, for which it is neceſſary. Let us proportionably have little affection and adherence to it. Let us uſe it; but for neceſſity, and not for delight. Let us look upon the world with the eyes of pilgrims, taking but ſo much of it as is requiſite for our paſſing on. Set we before us the example of the life of our LORD led on earth, during the daies of His fleſh, (for indeed it is the pattern of that life we live here below after our regeneration.) He ſought not either the glory, or the pleaſures, or the riches of the World. He adhered not to any one of thoſe things; but uſed what was neceſſary for His food and raiment, with great ſobriety, and frugality; not taſting the fruition of it, and ſo little fearing to be deprived of the fame, that inſtead of the glory of the world, He voluntarily ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extreme ignominy; poverty, and nakedneſs, inſtead of riches; torments, and the croſs, inſtead of pleaſure. And ſo you ſee, my Brethren, how the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our being dead in CHRIST JESUS, ſhould turn us aſide from the affecting, and the ſeeking of earthly things.</p>
                     <p>But the life we alſo have in Him, ſhould no leſs ſet us at diſtance from the ſame; and this is that the Apoſtle ſets before us in the ſecond place; <hi>You are dead, and your life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is hid with JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST in GOD. When CHRIST, who is your life, ſhall appear, then ſhall you alſo appear with Him in glory.</hi> It ſeems that the firſt words do tend, to prevent an objection, which might be made to the Apoſtle, upon his ſaying, that we are dead. For how doth this conſiſt with that, which he aſſerted afore, namely, that we are riſen again with CHRIST? If we be riſen, we live; and if we live, it is not true that we are dead. But this difficulty is eaſily reſolv'd. For firſt, the life, unto which we are dead, is the life of ſin, and of the fleſh, as we have explicated
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50919:165"/>it; whereas the life unto which we be riſen in JESUS CHRIST, is the life of CHRIST, and of His Spirit. The one is the life of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and the other of the new. Now it is not incompatible, that one and the ſame perſon be deprived of the former, and poſſeſſed of the latter. Nay, on the contrary, it is not poſſible, that ſuch as live in the former manner, ſhould alſo live in the latter; and as in nature, the generation of one thing doth naturally preſuppoſe the corruption of another; ſo likewiſe in grace, the life of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> doth of neceſſity inferr the death of the firſt; ſo that, from our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riſen again with CHRIST, it is ſo far from following, we are not dead to the fleſh, that quite on the contrary, it thence neceſſarily follows, we are dead to the fleſh; it not being poſſible to affirm the former, without ſuppoſing the latter; nor to place the life of CHRIST in us otherwiſe, than by the death of <hi>Adam</hi> in us. An inevitable neceſſity requires, the one do dye, that the other may live in us.</p>
                     <p>As for that life, which we acquire by our reſurrection with JESUS CHRIST, the Apoſtle grants, that it pertaineth to us, and that in this behalf it may be ſaid of us, that we live, as he doth ſay frequently both of other beleevers in general, and of himſelf in particular. Yet notwithſtanding he ſhews us again, that this life of CHRIST is not manifeſted, and compleated in us; that it is yet for the preſent, hidden in GOD with JESUS CHRIST; ſo as in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it might be ſaid of us, while we are on the earth, that we live not; and that we have not yet the life unto which CHRIST hath raiſed us; after the ſame manner,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.22, 23.</note> as he ſpares not to ſay elſe-where, that our being ſaved, is in hope, and we yet wait for the adoption; as if we had not hitherto receiv'd the ſalvation and adoption of GOD. For the right underſtanding of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, we muſt conſider briefly what the Apoſtle here ſaith of it; and firſt, what that life is, which he calleth ours. Secondly, how it is hid in GOD, with JESUS CHRIST; and then laſtly, what ſhall be that manifeſtation of this life, which he promiſeth us at the appearing of CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>The life of the faithful is that ſame, which JESUS CHRIST doth give them, inſtead of the life He taketh from them, when He receiveth them into His communion. This which he takes away, was impure, and vicious; the other was pure, and holy. This was natural, and earthly; the other is ſpiritual, and heavenly. The principle of the former was a carnal mind, and an irregular concupiſcence; the principle of the latter is a divine ſaith, and a juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable love. The one conſiſted in a vicious fruition of the fleſh, and of the earth; the other is a ſweet, and a legitimate poſſeſſing of the Spirit, and of Heaven. And as the former was mortal, and periſhing, no leſs than the fleſh, and the earth, from which it drew its nutriment: ſo the other is incorruptible, and eternal, according to the nature of the Spirit that quickens it, and of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that maintains it. The fruits of the former were ſin, and ſhame, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The fruits of the latter are righteouſneſs, honour, joy, and immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That firſt life therefore, to ſay true, was a death rather than a life, being ſuch, as after a ſhort and feaveriſh agitation could not terminate but in eternal ſufferings. And this other, on the contrary, is alone truly worthy of the name of life, which name alſo the Scripture does oft-times purely, and abſolutely give it;

Withal, this body, which makes up a part of our being, is yet ſubject to the laws of natural life, nor can it be ſuſtained but by the uſe of terrene, and corruptible elements, and by the low, and vile functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of eating, and drinking, and ſleeping. Whereas that divine life, which we have in JESUS CHRIST, is freed from all theſe infirmities, requiring a coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial, and in ſome ſort, ſpiritual body; which is conſerved by the ſole ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the quickening ſpirit, without needing the commerce of any earthy, and periſhing things. Whence it does appear, that to ſpeak properly, and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhall not have this bleſſed life, till after the laſt reſurrection. We now have but title to it, and the firſt buddings, the rudiments, and initials of it; which is the thing the Apoſtle excellently ſignifies, when ſpeaking of Himſelf, and of all the faithful, he ſaith, that <hi>we have the firſt-fruits of the Spirit;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.22.</note> that is, as it were the firſt lineaments of this divine and ſpiritual nature, whereof the LORD hath made us partakers, to uſe St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words.

                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> here doth at once very truly, and very admirably well ſay, that <hi>our life</hi> (that is, the life we have by JESUS CHRIST) <hi>is,</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>hid with CHRIST in GOD:</hi> becauſe the Father doth yet keep it in His hand, reſerving the full diſplaying of it in us unto the time He hath fore-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in His counſel. Untill then it doth not appear; but abideth hidden in GOD, as a ſure and certain effect, in its true and immutable cauſe. The world ſees it not in us, and the firſt-fruits of it we already have, are to it ſo unknown, that far from believing, we have any life more excellent than its own, it accounts us on the contrary, the miſerableſt, and deſpicableſt creatures of the earth, and doth think our life to be fooliſhneſs, and meer frenſie, and judgeth that the end thereof will be without honour, as the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> well ſaith. And in truth,
<note place="margin">Wiſd. 5 3</note> GOD doth moſt frequently put this heavenly treaſure in earthen veſſels, and chooſeth for this bleſſed life per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons weak, and contemptible, and ſuch as are of no conſideration among the men of the World; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly obſerves; neither is there in them,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26, 27. Iſa. 53.2.</note> any more than was ſometime in their head, either form, or comelyneſs, or any thing that ſhould induce thoſe that ſee them, to deſire them. Whereto may be added the afflictions that do extremely disfigure them, and darken that little luſtre which they have. Aimd theſe meaneſſes and infirmities, it is hard to diſcern any one ray of that glory they are deſtinated to. Themſelves, in their great tentations, enter into doubt of it. And when the ſpirit that quickens them, doth for their conſolation diſcover the perfections and wonders of their future life moſt clearly, and with the greateſt evidence; ſo it is, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, that which they ſee, and taſte of it, is ſo ſmall a matter, in compariſon of what they ſhall have in the end, that it might well be ſaid, <hi>their life is hidden</hi> in reference to themſelves. And thus St.
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2.</note> 
                        <hi>John</hi> informeth us. <hi>Beloved,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are now children of GOD, but it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi>

                     <p>But we may not forget what the Apoſtle here adds, to wit, that <hi>our life is hid in GOD with CHRIST;</hi> whereby he ſignifies two things; firſt, that <hi>CHRIST</hi> is yet at preſent in ſome ſort, and in ſome ſenſe hidden; to wit, in regard of the glory of His perſon. For though His Salvation, and His dominion have been diſcovered by His Goſpel, unto every creature, both Jews and Gentiles; yet having withdrawn His up-riſen, and glorified humane nature up to Heaven, into the Sanctuary, and He from thence governing His kingdom, by the ſecret motions of His ſpirit; His perſon remaineth hidden from the eyes of the World; this great veil of the Heavens, which on all ſides environeth the Sanctuary, into which He is entred, hindring us from ſeeing His glory, how ſparkling and radiant ſoever it be. Secondly, the Apoſtle ſignifieth by theſe words, that our life is properly, and directly in CHRIST; that he is the ſource, and the cauſe of it; and that two manner of waies; the one in that He merited it for us by His ſufferings; the other, in that He produced, and formed it in us by His Spirit; by reaſon whereof He is called, <hi>the Author,</hi> and <hi>the Prince of life;</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.4.</note> that <hi>life is in Him.</hi> Then again, our life is in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> as in its original pattern, wherein at preſent doth exiſt the true and perfect form of that ſanctity, glory, perfection, and immortality, in which the life we ſhall be inveſted with, conſiſteth. Wherefore He is termed our <hi>elder brother, our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> or <hi>beginning,</hi> and <hi>our firſt-fruits,</hi> as we have ſaid at the entrance of this diſcourſe. From whence there redoundeth unto us a great, and a firm conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, againſt all the tempeſts of the preſent World; when we conſider, that how ſad and frightful ſoever at times our undoing is, yet we live in GOD, and in His CHRIST. CHRIST is the ſacred, and inviolable ſtock that beareth us, in which the ſap of our life is perfectly ſafe, above the rigors of winter, and ardors of ſummer, and all other perils that menace us. GOD is faithful, and CHRIST is living, and it is not poſſible, that either the one ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Himſelf, or the other dye. Since then the Father is the depoſitary, and the Son the ſtock of our life, let us make ſure account, that though we feel it but feebly, and faintly in our ſelves, yet we have it, and poſſeſs it, and ſhall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally have it, ſo as nothing ſhall be ever able to extinguiſh it. Let this ſweet hope ſuſtain us, and cauſe us to wait patiently for the term of that full, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire manifeſtation, which the Apoſtle in the ſequel promiſeth us, <hi>When CHRIST your life ſhall appear, then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you alſo ſhall appear in glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His calling CHRIST our life, is a brave expreſſion, full of force and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis: ſutable to that, we read in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> where ſpeaking of the LORD's anointed,
<note place="margin">Lam. 4.20.</note> he calleth him <hi>the breath of our noſtrils;</hi> to ſignifie, that it is upon him our whole life dependeth, and that (if we may ſo ſay) it is by his ſacred mouth we draw our breath. Thus the Apoſtle's ſaying here, that CHRIST is our life, doth not ſimply ſignifie, that He is the cauſe and author of our life; but that it fully and wholly dependeth upon Him; that without Him, and ſeparate from Him, we have not a drop, nor ſpark of life; and that it is in Him alone, we have all the being, all the moving, and all the feeling, that reſpects the life of Heaven. In very deed it is He that hath merited it for us, by His death. It is He that hath brought it to light, by His Goſpel. It's He hath ſhewed us a moſt accompliſh'd pattern of it in His perſon, at His iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing out of His ſepulchre. It's He that hath given us the firſt-fruits of it by His word, and Spirit; and conſerveth, and increaſeth them in us, by His bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. It is He that keeps the fulneſs of it for us, in His treaſury on high, as being the true Father of eternity; And laſtly, it is He, that taking this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious life out of His heavenly cabinet one day, will put it on us with His own hand. Beſides, we do poſſeſs neither the beginnings, nor the perfection of it, but in Him, and by the benefit of our communion with Him; in that we are members, and branches of His, which cannot live but united with their head, and incorporated in their vine.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle therefore ſaith, that when this ſoveraign, and only author of our life ſhall appear, <hi>then we alſo ſhall appear in glory.</hi> He hath appeared once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; but in the fleſh, as the Apoſtle ſayes; <hi>GOD was manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50919:166"/>He ſhall appear again a ſecond time; but in glory. It's this ſecond appearing he doth mean, when the LORD JESUS deſcending from the Heavens, with the hoſt of His Angels, and ſeating Himſelf on a judicial Throne, ſhall openly ſhew to all the creatures of the World, His Glory, and Godhead, which the Heavens that contain his fleſh on high, and the weakneſſes that cover His my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body here below, do now hide from the earth, as we lately ſaid. <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall you alſo appear with Him in Glory.</hi> At the coming of this ſweet, and happy ſeaſon, you, as plants in the ſpring, ſhall receive your life; which from that ſacred ſtock, wherein it is now conſerved, ſhall be diffuſed into you, and into all the other branches of this vine of GOD, and crown you at an inſtant with its eternal verdure. The glory whereof he ſpeaks, doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the light, the perfections, the wonders, and the pomp of bliſsful life; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of GOD, love, and ſanctity, and joy; the immortality of our bodies, their beauty, their brightneſs, their ſtrength, and impaſſibility; and in fine, all the pieces of that infinite good, the grandeur, and excellency whereof, we ſhall never diſtinctly comprehend, untill the time that we poſſeſs it. We ſhall then appear in this glory, firſt becauſe, beſide the firſt-fruits of it, which we have, JESUS CHRIST ſhall give us the fulneſs of it, which we have not; this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, the greateſt, and moſt illuſtrious part of His glory, which now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth hidden in Him, being then to be ſhed abroad upon us.

                     <p>Thus you ſee, Beloved Brethren, what kind of life it is, which JESUS CHRIST doth promiſe, and communicate unto His faithful ones; to wit, the fruit of our faith, and of that divine food which we have taken this morning; the life of Angels; the crown of Saints; a ſuper-eminent and eternal felicity in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a ſuper-eminent and immortal glory; It's the rich treaſury, the living and inexhauſtible ſpring of our conſolation and ſanctification. Judge, I beſeech you, what manner of perſons they ſhould be, that have ſo high, and ſo divine an hope; and if it be not reaſonable, we ſhould withdraw our thoughts and our affections from the earth, to elevate them unto Heaven, ſince it is there our life is, and thence that we expect our chief happineſs. Chriſtian, are you not aſham'd to long for earth, you that have title for Heaven? to labour for the meat that periſheth, you that are deſtinated to a life which periſheth not? to run after ſhadows, you that, in JESUS CHRIST, have the ſubſtance of true, and ſolid happineſs? How much more generous and conſtant are the children of this generation in their vanity? Thoſe of them that are of noble extraction, and eſpecially they that are brought up in hope of a Crown, would not for any thing have a mechanick trade, or foul themſelves in ſordid actions; and even nations there are, among whom they totally refrain from commerce with other men, and account themſelves defiled, and profaned, by having but touched a plebeian. And you, that are the iſſue of Heaven, a child of the moſt High, a brother of His Angels, and an Heir of His kingdom; you, that are bred up with divine manna, in the hope of an heavenly life, and an immortal crown; how have you the heart to grope in the mud, and heap up dung? to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix with the miſerableſt bond-men of the earth, and the profaneſt workers of iniquity? A King's ſon heretofore refuſed to contend in the publick games, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaw no Kings do it. Chriſtian, remember the dignity of your name: ſeparate your ſelf from the exerciſes and divertiſements of the people of the world. Leave them the earth, out of which they come, and unto which they ſhall return. Enter not into ſo ignoble and fordid a race, in which you ſee none run but children of the earth, the race of Mammon, and the brood of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and ſerpents. Purifie your hearts, and your bodies; let it never betide
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50919:167"/>you to defile them with baſe and terrene either thoughts or actions. Say not, <hi>what ſhall we eat? what ſhall we drink? wherewithal ſhall we be clothed?</hi> Theſe are the thoughts and cares of bond-men. Theſe are the diſcourſes of Pagans. This is all they ſeek. You, that are Chriſtians, and whoſe life is hid in JESUS CHRIST, ſeek His kingdom, and His righteouſneſs. Let this be your ambition, and all the paſſion of your ſouls. Let this divine life, and the glory wherewith it will one day crown you, in the fight of Heaven and earth, be night and day the object of your thoughts. Take it away even at the preſent, with an holy impatiency. Begin betimes to live, as you ſhall live eternally. Let the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating of GOD, let the love of His beauties, let the meditating of His myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, let the conſidering of, and a converſing with His CHRIST, be your employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and your refreſhment in the preſent World. Sanctifie this earth, during the time you tarry on it, and change it, as much as may be, into Heaven, adorning it with an Angelick life and converſation. This is the way to make ſure your crown. For it will not be given in Heaven, but to thoſe that have deſired and ſought it in the time of their abode on earth. None ſhall reap eternal life, but they that have ſowed to the Spirit. No man ſhall have fruition above, but he that hath hoped here below; and no man hopeth here below, but he that cleanſeth himſelf from the filth of vices. <hi>He that hath this hope in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John.</hi> Repreſent inceſſantly unto your ſelves, this glorious coming of the Son of GOD.

How much will our confuſion be, if He ſhould ſurpriſe us, in the diſorder of our worldly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and occupations? But GOD forbid that this ſhould betide us. He hath waited ſufficiently for us. Let us employ that little time which is left us, with ſo much the more care, the leſs we have had for that which is paſt. Let us watch, let us pray, let us be doing. Let us work out our ſalvation with fear and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Let us lead lives worthy of the name of Chriſtians, which we bear; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Maſter whom we ſerve, and of the food He hath given us, and of the love He hath born us, and of the glory He keeps for us, cleanſing our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and waiting with an holy joy, and ſetled patience, for the revelation of this great GOD, and Saviour, to His Glory, and our Salvation. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; In all the deſigns of our lives, the End is the principle that moveth us to act, and the rule of our actions. The fair aſpect it gives us, is the thing that inſlameth our hearts, and kindleth in them the deſire of poſſeſſing it; which thereupon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakeneth the powers of our ſouls, and cauſeth each of them to employ what ability and induſtry they have, in the purſuit; the underſtanding, its light to find out, and make a due choice of means, fit to conduct us in it; the will, and affections, and other faculties of our nature, which depend upon them, their motions to get theſe means, and ſet them on work. All this is done, as you know, and experiment it daily, only to attain that End, we have propoſed to our ſelves. The ends which men aim at, are infinitely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and oftentimes even contrary to one another; and conſequently their courſes very different alſo; as if ſome went Eaſt, and others Weſt; or ſome took their way Southward, and others their march Northward. Yet notwithſtanding ſuch diverſity of intentions, and proſecutions, they are all incited, and led on in the ſelf-ſame manner; there being not one of them, but the deſire of ſome end he loveth, hath ſeized, and ſwayed unto action, and at length induced to take the courſe he ſteers, according to the paſſion he hath for the attainment of it, and the judgement his underſtanding makes of means proper to bring him to it. The end therefore being the firſt ſpring that ſetteth us a going, the principle of our motions, and as it were, the North of our courſe, the guide and meaſure of our actions; You ſee, My Brethren, that it infinitely concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to take it right, and having once taken it, to have it continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, for the referring, and addreſſing of all our travails to the ſame. Wherefore our LORD condemns thoſe, as unadviſed, and injudicious perſons, who enterpriſe a deſign without having firſt duly conſidered it; without having
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50919:168"/>ſate down, and taken their counters in hand, and exactly calculated all the coſt; that is, without having maturely, and compoſedly examin'd what the thing is which they deſire, and what abilities they have to compaſs it; as that ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous builder, who laid the foundation of a Tower, and was then conſtrained to give over, not having wherewithal to finiſh it. For this reaſon alſo the Maſters of Moral Philoſophy, that they might rightly form their ſcholars to it, have been wont to ſet before their eyes the felicity of man, that is, his End, for the enkindling a love and deſire of it in their hearts, and then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to them the means that are to be uſed to attain it.</p>
                     <p>Such is the method that the holy Apoſtle hath followed in this part of his divine diſcourſe which we are explicating to you. He ſhewed us at the entrance, Heaven, and JESUS CHRIST, who reigneth there, ſitting at the right-hand of His Father; together with that life, and immortality, and glory, which He keeps for, and promiſeth to His faithful ones. This is the end we ſhould tend unto. <hi>Seek</hi> (ſaid He) <hi>the things which are in Heaven;</hi> and I perſwade my ſelf, there is not a man ſo ſtupid, and ſavage, but an object ſo good, and ſo deſirable, does make impreſſion upon, and poſſeſs with love of it, and a ſecret paſſion to obtain it. Now, though the ſplendor of ſo noble, and ſo ſublime an happineſs, ſhould as ſoon as it appears, put out all that fallacious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the things of the earth, wherein the children of this world do vainly ſeek their good, and which they fooliſhly take for the end of their lives; yet the Apoſtle, to preſerve us from this error, and fully inform us of our true end, hath further expreſly adviſed us, not to place it in things here below. <hi>Mind not the things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which are upon the earth.</hi> Having therefore each of you ſetled this divine end of your lives in his heart, according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles doctrine, look at it continually. Let it be night and day before your eyes. This thought alone, is capable to direct all your ſteps; to govern all your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to purifie your ſouls; to render you invincible againſt all your enemies; to conſerve the peace, and the joy of GOD in you, and maintain His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations in you, amid the greateſt ſtorms. Yet this doth not ſatisfie our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. He, not content with having mark'd out our aim to us, and ſhewed in general what we ought to decline, doth particularize us the means we are to uſe, for arriving one day at that bleſſed Heaven, whither he had elevated our hearts. He diſcovers to us, and tells us, one by one, the ſhelves, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous paſſages of our courſe, and finally, goes over the moſt part of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the conduct of this grand deſign. He begins with vices of the fleſh, and of the earth; the two pernicious peſts of all, and moſt contrary to the deſign, which, by the grace of GOD, we are entred on. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commands us, to make mortal war upon them, and to fight, to weaken, to kill, and to deſtroy without pity, all that we ſhall perceive in our ſelves, to bear any affection or inclination to them. <hi>Mortifie therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your members which are upon the earth,</hi> &amp;c. The LORD pleaſe to bleſs now the voice of His Apoſtle, and ſink theſe words, which Himſelf ſometime inſpired, ſo deep into our fouls, that they may be at this time, effectual to our ſanctification, eradicating thoſe accurſed paſſions out of our hearts, which cannot live, nor fructifie there, without diſhonouring the Goſpel, and depriving us of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life, to which we aſpire. The ſpeech, as you ſee, contains two parts; the firſt of which commands us in general, to <hi>mortifie our members which are upon the earth.</hi> The other repreſents unto us in particular, ſome of theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our old man, which we are to mortifie; to wit, <hi>fornication, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inordinate appetite, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſs, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is idolatry.</hi> Theſe are the two heads, which, the grace of GOD aſſiſting, we will conſider in this action: firſt, the Apoſtle's general exhortation; and then in the ſecond place, the vices, which he doth by name, and expreſly give us order to mortifie.</p>
                     <p>As to the general exhortation, it is conceiv'd in theſe words, <hi>Mortifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your members which are on the earth;</hi> and to comprehend it aright, we muſt conſider the meaning of it, and the coherence. An underſtanding of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50919:168"/>of it, does depend upon that clauſe, <hi>your members which are upon the earth.</hi> For there is no one but ſees, that this term, members, cannot ſignifie here, as it ordinarily doth, the parts of which our body is com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> where, when he ſaith, <hi>Apply not your members to be inſtruments of iniquity unto ſin.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6.13.</note> If he had had this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention here, there would have been no need to add, as he doth, that theſe members are upon the earth, every one plainly ſeeing it. Beſides, what he ſaith in the ſequel, doth neceſſarily exclude this ſenſe. For he puts uncleanneſs, and covetouſneſs in the rank of thoſe members which he orders us to mortifie; things, that are not parts of our bodies, whereof neither the being, nor name, doth any way ſuit with them: but indeed, vices of our ſouls, in which they properly reſide, and whence they ſpread forth themſelves over our whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; defiling, and diſhonouring it divers waies. This addition leaves us no doubt at all, but that theſe vices, and others like them, together with all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ſhameful habitudes, from whence bad actions proceed, (which he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where calls, <hi>the deeds of the body, and works of the fleſh</hi>) are directly, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely thoſe members, the mortifying whereof he commands us.</p>
                     <p>But (you will ſay) how, and why doth he call them our members, ſeeing they are not the parts of our nature, which are all good, and created of GOD, but rather the maladies, the leproſies, and the peſts of our nature; ſupervening from without, by the venomous breath of the old Serpent, and his contagious commerce? things that deprave, and blaſt, eat out, and conſume our being, ſo far are they from accomodating it, or adorning it, or affording it either the benefit or the beauty, which the body doth derive from that diverſity of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, wherewith it is ſo admirably furniſhed? I anſwer, that this is very true; and that vices being the poiſon and ruine of our true being, they cannot be properly called members of it; it being evident, that a diſeaſe is nothing leſs than one of the members of the body, which it afflicteth. Yet this for all that hinders not, but the Apoſtle might, upon ſome other account, uſe this ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and compare the vices of humane nature, in the ſtate it now is, unto the divers members that conſtitute our body. And for the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, you may pleaſe to remember, that it is a form of ſpeaking very common in all languages, to compare thoſe things unto a body, which are made up of an accumulation, or collection of many parts, indeed different, but nevertheleſs knit together in ſome order, and having ſome ſequel and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſome upon the reſt among them; whence it comes that we ſay, the body of an Eſtate, of an Army, of a Town, of a Family. An whole, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is no diſtinction of parts, is called a maſs: one, in which ſome diſtinction is to be be obſerved, is termed a body. Thence it comes, that the Apoſtle compares that heap of vices, and ill inclinations, which exiſting now in all men from their birth, goes on growing, and gathering ſtrength with age, he compares it, I ſay, to, and gives it the name of a body; as you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you heard him ſpeak in the precedent chapter; where he ſaith, that by our regeneration in JESUS CHRIST, we have put off the body of the ſins of the fleſh. This ſame body of our vices, is alſo often compared to an entire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and called as you know, <hi>the old man,</hi> or <hi>the old Adam.</hi> For firſt, it is not one vice alone; it's a vaſt multitude of them; a maſs of horrors; an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra of evils; a mixture of many poiſons; an heap of an infinity of ordures; a complication of many maladies, that do all at once make ſpoyl of one and the ſame creature, and leave nothing ſound nor whole in it, from the ſole of the foot to the crown of the head, (to ſpeak with the Prophets) <hi>but cover it all over with wounds, and bruiſes, with putrified and inveterate ſores.</hi> Then again, theſe maladies, though all pernicious and mortal, are yet different among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; there's infidelity, ſuperſtition, diſtruſt, hatred, or contempt both of GOD and our neighbour, love of the fleſh, and the earth, pride, cruelty, ſloth, lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, intemperance, avarice, and a thouſand ſuch others. For who can ſo much as name them all? And though the confuſion, that alwaies neceſſarily follows error and vice, be, to ſay true, very great among them; nevertheleſs, there is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50919:169"/>ſome kind of order and ſequacity to be obſerved in them. For whereas it is knowledge that ſhould move, and guide our nature; here it is ignorance that governeth this troop <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>monſters. Blindneſs is their guide, and error their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector. And whereas, in the due conſtitution of man, the will follows the light of the underſtanding: here the will followeth its darkneſs, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth thoſe phantaſms, which the phrenſie of its leader takes for real, and ſolid things. And as in the diſeaſes of the body, what diſorder ſoever there be, a certain order and regularity is nevertheleſs to be ſeen in their beginnings, their progreſs, and increaſes, nothing coming to paſs in them without cauſe: ſo is it in the ſickneſſes of the ſoul; they have their acceſſes, their inflammations, their returns, and their periods: that though there be nothing but a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſorder, which diſplaceth every thing, and overturns all: yet all hath its certain cauſes. It's therefore with a great deal of reaſon, and elegance, that the Apoſtle compares this ſtrange convention of ſo many evils, which are ſo divers, and do all work with ſome ſequel and dependance unto a body; and each of thoſe vices, of which it is compoſed, as covetouſneſs, fornication, and the like, unto the members of a body.</p>
                     <p>He calleth them, our members; becauſe that old man, which is made up of them, is wholly ours, and does inveſt all the principles of our life, from their root, and invelope them, and mingle ſo deeply with them, that it all, in a ſort, is nothing but corruption, and malady; this venome infecting all the actions, and all the motions of our nature, its underſtanding, its affections, and paſſions, together with the thoughts, words, and actions which flow from them; ſo that as our animal and natural life conſiſteth in the exerciſing of our members, and in their actions; in like manner, our moral life is all of it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a continual exerciſing of theſe vices, and of the ſins they produce; as is to be clearly ſeen, if you conſider the lives of profane and unregenerate perſons; For they are nought elſe, but a continual exerciſe of vices, of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of vanity, of covetouſneſs, of luxury and ſenſuality, as they are addicted more or leſs to the one, or the other of theſe ſins; the perpetual running of a foul and muddy ſtream, which a corrupted ſpring doth daily thruſt forth, that you cannot obſerve ſo much as one of its ſwellings or rollings exempt from its filthineſs. And this may ſuffice for comprehending the reaſon why the Apoſtle calls theſe parts of the old man our members. For as to that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſome do propoſe in this matter, namely, that the members of our bodies having been created of GOD, they are not ours, but in regard of uſe, and not in regard of their original; whereas the members of the old man are ours, all manner of waies, having been made and formed in us, by our own fault and naughtineſs, and not by the hand of GOD, who created man upright, and pure; man diſtorting, and depraving himſelf: this conceit, I ſay, ſeems to me more ſubtil than ſolid. For though the matter of it be very true, yet it is ſo wide from the Apoſtles deſign in this place, that there is little likelyhood he thought upon it, when he called the vices here of our corrupt nature, our members. Without doubt he ſo doth, only becauſe it is in the exerciſing and acting of theſe vices, that the carnal life of men doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
                     <p>For the reſt, if you remember what we ſaid upon the precedent Text, of the death of the old man in us, you will not think it ſtrange, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, after having ſaid that we are dead, does not yet forbear to exhort us to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the members of this ſame life, which we have put off in JESUS CHRIST. For our being dead in this reſpect, doth not import, that the life of the fleſh is entirely, and abſolutely extinct in us; (this will not be effected, untill we ſhall quit it, at our leaving of the earth, and put on coeleſtial, and ſpiritual bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at the day of the reſurrection;) but the Scripture doth thus ſpeak, firſt, becauſe JESUS CHRIST hath, by His death, His reſurrection, and His aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into Heaven, deſtroyed, and aboliſhed all the cauſes that gave nutriment and ſuſtenance to the life of the old man; and ſecondly, becauſe the old man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> receiv'd his deaths wound in each of us by the faith, that ingrafted, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50919:169"/>incorporated us into JESUS CHRIST; ſo as if we perſevere, it is not poſſible that he ſhould recover. But this death of His, as we ſaid, doth not arrive all at once. It's executed by little and little; and the exerciſe of a believer, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſtay here below, is to buſie himſelf inceſſantly about it, daily to weaken and wound that fleſh of his, which is already nailed to the croſs of his LORD; to entinguiſh by little and little all the life it hath remaining; that is, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his members, as the Apoſtle here ſpeaks. In this ſenſe, you ſee, theſe two conceptions are ſo far from having ought that's contrary, or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible in them; that quite otherwiſe, the one doth evidently and neceſſarily follow from the other. For ſince we are dead in JESUS CHRIST; ſince the arreſt of the death of our old man is paſt; ſince JESUS CHRIST hath done on His part, all that was neceſſary to execute it; ſince this fleſh condemn'd, is already faſtened to His croſs; it is evident, that it ought to live no longer; and that by conſequent, each of us ſhould inceſſantly beſtirr our ſelves, to put it to death, by mortifying its members, beating down, and weakening their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; driving deep into them our Saviour's nails, and thorns, untill they be effectually reduced unto that ſtate of death, unto which they were condemned, having no more either motion, or ſentiment, or force, or life at all in us. Lo, My Brethren, the thing the Apoſtle means by theſe words, <hi>mortifie your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> To ſay it in a word, he would have us weaken, and extinguiſh the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our old man, and put them in ſuch a ſtate of death, as hath no more ſtrength, nor vigour, nor ſtirring.</p>
                     <p>But as this holy man's whole language is full of profound wiſdome, I am of opinion, he thus ſpeaks, to give a further blow to thoſe ſeducers, whoſe error he had been refuting in the fore-going chapter; Theſe men, to recommend their diſciplines, gave out, that they did not at all ſpare the body; that they had no regard to the ſatiating of the fleſh; that they oppos'd its pleaſures, and humbled, and mortified it. And you know, that this is at this very day, the language of thoſe votaries, who place Chriſtianity in ſuch exerciſes. They ſpeak of nothing but their mortifications. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore doth here correct the vain conceits of this error, and ſheweth us what true mortification is, and that that is worthy of the ſtudy and exerciſe of the faithful. It is (ſaith he) the members of the old man, we are to mortifie, and not thoſe of the body; It is vices; It's fornication, and covetouſneſs, and pride, that we muſt quell, and kill with blows, and not our body. And as one of the Prophets ſometime ſaid to the ſuperſtitious of his age, who faſted, and afflicted themſelves, and rent their clothes: <hi>Rend your hearts, and not your garments:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joel 2.13.</note> in like manner the Apoſtle here oppoſeth the internal mortification of ſins, as only neceſſary, and truly worthy of a Chriſtian, unto the external mortification of the body, unto which error did, and ſtill doth tye up its ſelf. For in truth, to what purpoſe is it, to beat a man's breaſt, and rend his back, while ſin mean time reigneth in his heart? To what purpoſe is it, to afflict the members of this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, while the members of the old man are left ſound, and whole? to ſtretch out the one upon the ground, and lye in aſhes, while the others are in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? It is not by an hair-cloth, nor a whip, that vices are ſubdued. Theſe things incommodate the body; but do not, ſure, amend the ſoul. They hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the out-ſide; they hurt not within: But leave the old man there at full liberty, with his thoughts, and luſts. And it is not without reaſon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle advertiſeth us elſe-where, that <hi>bodily exerciſe profits little.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note> Experience hath juſtified his words; the lives of thoſe that addict themſelves to ſuch exerciſes, being no better, yea, ſometimes worſe than the lives of others. And it is not long ago,
<note place="margin">The Jeſuit <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius,</hi> l. 5 c. 3. de la penit, publique.</note> ſince Truth drew this confeſſion from the penn of one of our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt adverſaries, that ſuch exerciſes do many times much hurt even mens ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advancement, becauſe of a ſecret opinionativeneſs and pride, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, and feed in ſome ſpirits, who become arrogant and haughty upon them, and take occaſion from them, to contemn thoſe that lead a more moderated life. The Apoſtle therefore would have us, inſtead of theſe childiſh, and poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable exerciſes, to lay our our labour upon the mortifying of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the old man, that is, our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <p>And it is to the ſame intention of his, that I referr what he addeth, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that theſe members are upon the heart: which is a thing excellently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what way ſoever you conſider it. For firſt, theſe vices are all upon the earth, if you reſpect either their riſe, or their buſineſs, or laſtly, their end and deſires. It's clear, they all ſpring up out of the earth, from admiration, and coveting of earthly things; they all creep on the earth, in its excrements, or in its fruits, and riſe no higher than its fumes and vapours; wretchedly cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe ſordid vanities, which they feel to fleet away, and periſh between their hands while they gripe them, and are enjoying them. Where is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs? Where is luxury? Where is gluttony, and ambition? What ſeek they for? What deſire they? For what do they toil themſelves? Sure, you plainly ſee, that the earth is their only element; that the metal which the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and the fleſh which the other longeth for, and the meſſes that the third breaths after, and the vanities; that are the paſſion of the latter; I ſay, you plainly ſee, that all this is but earth, or fruits, and productions of the earth. They are then, to ſay true, theſe members of the old man, that faſten us to the earth, and not the members of this body; it is ſin, and not ſimply this fleſh. For, as to our body, it needs but a little, for its converſation, during that little time we paſs here below, whereas the deſires of vice are infinite. Whence it follows, according to the Apoſtle's conception, that it is vice we are to mortifie, and not the body: the members of the old man, and not thoſe of the body. Then again, if you conſider the place deſtinated to be the abode of the one, and the other nature, you will further ſee, that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the old man, that is, vices, are not, but upon the earth. It's there they make their ſpoyl, and exerciſe all their tyranny; there they live, there they dye, there they rot, unprofitably conſuming themſelves in their own wretched filthineſſe. They have no place in Heaven, where enters nothing but what is pure; where perfect ſanctity liveth, and reigneth eternally, crowned with immortal glory. But the members of our bodies, which ſuperſtition fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They ſhall be one day lifted up into the Heavens, and enter into the Sanctuary of GOD, and live on His manna, and partake of the fruits of the coeleſtial tree of life.</p>
                     <p>Knowing now the meaning of this exhortation of the Apoſtle's, you may eaſily of your ſelves, without my ſaying any thing of it, comprehend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion it hath with the precedent words, which imported, that <hi>we are dead, and</hi> that <hi>our life is hid with CHRIST in GOD, and</hi> that <hi>we ſhall one day appear with Him in glory.</hi> For ſince we be dead to the world, and called to the hope and the fruition of an heavenly life, which is hidden on high in JESUS CHRIST, and ſhall be one day manifeſted, and given to each one of us: who ſees not, that all this doth moſt ſtrictly oblige us to draw off all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from the earth? and to cut all the ties that faſten us unto it? that is, to mortifie our members which are on the earth, all the vices that engage us, and enſnare us in the things of the earth.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth, that we conſider the vices, or members of the old man, which the Apoſtle does particularly name, and expreſly injoyn us to mortifie; He nameth five in all; fornication, uncleanneſs, inordinate appetite, evil concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, and covetouſneſs. I conceive that the four firſt are related to one and the ſame head, and be but divers branches of one and the ſame ſtock, to wit, luxury, or ſenſuality. Fornication is the principal ſpecies of them, the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders whereof are ſo evident, and ſo well known, that no one can be ignorant of the nature of it. Uncleanneſſe comprehendeth all the other ordures and pollutions that are contrary to the chaſtity and honeſty of our bodies; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſts, violations, and thoſe other abominable furies of carnal paſſions, which tranſgreſs even the laws of nature, as corrupt as it is. The word, which we have tranſlated <hi>inordinate appetite,</hi> doth ſignifie literally, perturbation, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in the original tongue. But it is frequently uſed, to expreſs the paſſion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50919:170"/>of lubrieity, and the filthy diſpoſition of a voluptuous, and eſſeminate heart, that eaſily receives the impreſſion of all laſcivious objects, and abandons its ſelf to theſe kind of pleaſures, and runs out, and pours forth its ſelf, in a ſort, entirely to them. Evil concupiſcence, which the Apoſtle addeth in the fourth place, is the ſource, or the root of all the vices of this ſort. For though concupiſcence be often taken in general, for all irregular appetites, and deſires, whatever the objects are, to which they are unduly carried; yet it ſometimes ſignifies thoſe in particular, which reſpect the pleaſures of the fleſh, and we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten uſe the word concupiſcence, in this ſenſe in our vulgar language. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I grant, that in this place it may be taken in a larger extent, as impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting inordinate coveting either of pleaſures, or of profits, and riches; becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of covetouſneſs alſo, and not of ſenſuality alone. He calls this concupiſcence evil, to diſtinguiſh it from that; which keeping within its juſt bounds, deſireth things lawful, in a due manner and meaſure.</p>
                     <p>The laſt of the vices here touched by the Apoſtle, is Covetouſneſſe, a vice no leſs known than the fore-going. Only, notable is the elogium he gives it, in ſaying, <hi>Covetouſneſs, which is idolatry.</hi> For this title ſurpriſeth us, every one well knowing, that idolatry, and covetouſneſs are, to ſpeak properly, two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſins; the firſt directly reſpecting religion, and the ſervice of the Deity, when men adore a thing, which is not the true GOD, and render it thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious honours which belong to none but GOD; whereas covetouſneſs is a moral ſin, that conſiſts in an exceſſive, and immoderate adheſion to the goods of this world; makes men get them, and poſſeſs them amiſs, and contrary to the laws of juſtice, and reaſon. Theſe two things therefore being ſo differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, why ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that covetouſneſs is idolatry? Dear Brethren; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he was in no wiſe ignorant of this; nor did he intend in this place, to confound theſe two ſins, which in divers other places he does moſt expreſly diſcriminate, and diſtinguiſh, as particularly there, where making a liſt of the principal ſinners, that ſhall not inherit the kingdom of GOD, he ſets down the idolater, and the covetous ſeverally, and each of them in his rank. But aiming here, in paſſing to brand, and blaſt this vice, for the giving of us a juſt horror at it, that we might not account it, as the greater part of men do, a light matter, and a lowneſs, and weakneſs of ſpirit, rather than a crime; he qualifies it with the elogium of idolatry, improperly, (I grant) and figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but very fitly for the diſcovering of its venoum to us. And it is not here alone that he hath done it. He brands this vice after the ſame manner again, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where ſpeaking of the covetous, he adds the very ſame thing, and ſays, <hi>who is an idolater.</hi> You know (ſaith he) that <hi>no fornicator, nor unclean perſon, nor covetous, who is an idolater, hath any inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the kingdom of CHRIST, and of GOD.</hi> Now this propoſition, that covetouſneſſe is idolatry, may be pertinently reſolved two manner of waies: Firſt, by taking it, as ſignifying ſimply, that it is an abominable thing. For inaſmuch as there was nothing in all the horrors of Paganiſm, that was more ſeverely prohibited of GOD, nor more hated or abhorred among the Jews, than idolatry; thence it comes, that they gave this name to every thing which they would deteſt; and I perceive, that even to this day, this form of expreſſion is common among them, and when they would ſignifie, that a thing is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, they frequently ſay, It's an idol, or it is idolatry; ſo that we need not wonder, if St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who followeth all the idioms and terms of the Jews language, hath ſaid here, in a like ſenſe, that covetouſneſſe is idolatry, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that it's an horrible and deteſtable vice. We meet with a like expreſſion, or rather indeed, the ſame, in <hi>Samuel,</hi> when the Prophet, to ſhew <hi>Saul</hi> how great the horror was, of the fault he had committed in not executing punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the thing GOD had commanded him, tells him,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.23.</note> that <hi>to reſiſt an order of the LORD's, is a ſin of divination</hi> (that is, of witchcraft, or magick) and not to acquieſce in what He hath commanded, is a ſin of idols, or images, that is, idolatry. There you ſee, by the names of the moſt abominable ſins, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and idolatry, he ſignifies the horridneſſe of diſobeying the voice of GOD;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50919:171"/>altogether, as the Apoſtle, in our Text, expreſſeth the horridneſſe of avarice, I add in the ſecond place, that though covetouſneſſe be not properly, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Idolatry, yet it hath ſo much reſemblance with it, that there is ſcarce any other ſin to which this name doth better agree. The idolater looks on his idols with profound veneration; ſo doth the covetous, on his goods and coin. The one ſhuts up his idols; ſo the other doth his. The one ſerves an image; and the other gold and ſilver; and when the idol is of either of theſe two metals, (as they not ſeldome are) they both ſerve the ſelf-ſame thing, with this difference only, that the idolater ſerves it under one form, and one way figured; the covetous under another; The one offers incenſe, and ſacrifices to his idol; the other immolates his heart and affections to his. Add hereto, that the covetous bears more love to the objects of his paſſion; and renders them more ſervice than he doth to GOD; <hi>He puts his hope in gold, and ſaith to fine gold, Thou art my conſidence.</hi> And if you thoroughly examine his life, you will find, that he ſerves none but Mammon. Mammon is then his GOD; after the ſame manner, as the Apoſtle ſaith elſe-where, that <hi>the holly is the GOD of voluptuous men;</hi> whence follows, that it cannot be denied, but that he alſo is an idolater.</p>
                     <p>In fine, there are two things here to be yet heeded; The firſt is, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the names of theſe five vices, fornication, uncleanneſſe, inordinate appetite, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſſe, the Apoſtle ſignifies, not meerly the acts of theſe ſins, which are alſo commonly called by the ſame names; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and preciſely, the internal habits of them, as ſeated in the ſoul. For it's they properly, that are the members of the old man: the acts are but his effects and operations. His meaning therefore is, that we cut them up to the very root; that we, not only abſtain from thoſe vile actions unto which they ſway ſuch as they poſſeſſe; but that we mortifie, and extinguiſh them themſelves, to the end that theſe accurſed ſources or evil being once dried up, our life may remain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and clean from all the ordures and filth of them. The other thing is, that we muſt not fancy, the Apoſtle meant to make here an exact enumeration of all the vices of the old man. He gives us but a ſmall ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them; intending we ſhould likewiſe mortifie all the reſt, as gluttony, drunkenneſſe, and the like. For it would be no benefit to us to have cut off one of his members, if we let him live, in reſpect of others. His life is our death, and while he conſerves it whole in any of his parts, we cannot be in ſafety. Let us labour therefore to extinguiſh it all. Eradicate all its luſts; repreſſe all its ſtirrings; and ſmother all its ſentiments. Let us make a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and irreconcilable war upon this whole brood of monſters. Spare we not any one of them. Let us exterminate them all as an <hi>Anathema.</hi> Treating them, as the ancient Iſraelites ſometime did the accurſed nations of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and as the Pſalmiſt would have the little children of <hi>Babilon</hi> treated,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 137.9.</note> deſiring they might be daſh'd againſt the ſtones. It's in this caſe only, that cruelty is laudable, and that a man may lay aſide pity without blame. He that hath pity on the members of his old man, is cruel to himſelf; to ſpare them, is to deſtroy ones ſelf; and to conſerve them, is to betray our own ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>This then, My Brethren, is the mortification which the Apoſtle requireth of us. Neither he, nor any other of the Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST, doth any where injoyn us to wear hair-cloth, or to disfigure our countenances with a multitude of faſts, and watchings, or to go barefoot, or to put on a cowl, or renounce the uſage of any of the meats which GOD hath created for our ſervice; much leſs to cover our ſelves with dung and filth, or to gore our ſelves all over with diſciplines.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.12.</note> God will one day ſay to thoſe, that amuſe themſelves in ſuch mortifications, <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi> and <hi>why have ye ſuffered ſo much in vain?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3.4.</note> The only mortification he demands of us, is that of the old man: that we beat down our vices, and not that we rend our bodies; that we deface our paſſions, and not our countenances; that we renounce our luſts, and not His gifts. That we give the diſcipline to our manners, and not our ſhoulders. As for our ſelves, My Brethren, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50919:171"/>that we have renounced the mortification of the ſuperſtitious; the miſery is, we do not practiſe that which is our Saviours; though without it, no man can have part in Him, or His kingdom; as the Apoſtle intimates plainly enough here, where he doth not own any perſon for a member of CHRIST riſen, who is not dead; and elſe-where he affirms in expreſſe terms; that <hi>they that are CHRIST's have crucified the fleſh, with its affections and luſts.</hi> We amuſe not our ſelves in bodily exerciſe. No; but neither do we more heed that of the ſpirit. We ſpare our hearts no leſs than our bodies; and do not treat the vices of the one, any whit more roughly than the skin of the other. Men ſee ſufficiently by the actions of our lives, that the members of this old man, whom the croſs of CHRIST hath condemned unto death, remaining very far from being dead, are ſcarce wounded in us; that they are not ſo much as ſcratch'd; that they live in us, in their full ſtrength and vigour, and no more feel our Saviour's nails, and thorns, than if He had not died, or we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Him at all. Our adverſaries are nor to ſeek how to charge it home upon us; and it is the only one of their arguments that puts us to confuſion. We eaſily anſwer all their other reproaches. There's none but this, wherein our conſciences enforce us to ſeparate the cauſe of JESUS CHRIST, and of His Goſpel, from our own. For if His truth were to be judged of, by the quality of our deportments, who could defend it, ſeeing the horrible diſorder that generally appeareth in our lives? Let us conſider only the two articles here touched by the Apoſtle, unchaſtity, and avarice. In conſcience, is the one, and the other of theſe two paſſions, dead among us? Have they not as great a vogue, as among the men of the World? Is the modeſty of youth, the honeſty of marriage, is chaſtity, and temperance, better practiſed here than other-where? Doth the fordidneſſe, and eagerneſſe of avarice leſs appear? Verily, (I am extremely aſham'd to ſay it) all is alike; except that thoſe without do confeſs, and diſcipline themſelves, and macerate their fleſh with ſome kind of faſts, and ſay their chappelet; whereby at leaſt they ſhew ſome ſenſe of their faultineſſe, though they apply ineffectual, and ridiculous reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of it. Whereas we, after committing the ſame faults, and dabling in the ſame filth, come to preſent our ſelves impudently here, without fearing GOD, or having ſhame of men. And if the voice of the LORD, that reſoundeth in this place, do draw ſome ſigh from us, at our going hence, we return every one to our vices, as pleaſant, and as obſtinate as ever.</p>
                     <p>GOD is ſo good, that He hath hitherto attended our repenting. But let us beware, leſt our obdurateneſſe do change His patience into fury, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Him in the end, to puniſh ſuch a refractory contempt of His word, and His favours; and avenge the affront we do His Goſpel, by living ſo ill, in ſo fair, and ſo divine a light. Let us all deſcend into our ſelves. Let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our carriage, and our conſciences. Let each one interrogate himſelf; Come, my ſoul, after ſo many moneths, and years, that JESUS CHRIST hath ſo carefully inſtructed thee, what pains haſt thou taken to conform thy ſelf to Him; and to imprint the image of His death, and of His life, upon thy behaviour? Haſt thou nailed thine old man to His croſs? Haſt thou mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his members? Haſt thou deprived them of that wretched vigour which they diſplay with ſo much efficacy in the children of diſobedience? Do they leave thee at reſt? Or when they begin to trouble thee, haſt thou the courage to reſiſt them? Doth not avarice ſtretch out thine hand upon the goods of others? or doth it not with-hold the ſame from imparting of thine own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poor? Haſt thou not felt its vain ſollicitudes, and fruitleſs melancholies? it's inſatiable cupidity, and unbridled eagerneſs? and that impudence it hath to deſpiſe, and violate honeſty, laws, and decency, for the ſatisfying its inordinate deſires? But if avarice hath not importun'd thee, tell me, my ſoul, hath not the luſt of the eyes, and the vanity of the fleſh at one time or other inſnared thee? Hath not this traiterous Dalila lulled thee aſleep? Haſt thou guarded the glory of that <hi>Nazareat</hi> to which GOD hath conſecrated thee from her am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhments? Brethren, let us thus catechize our ſouls daily, and about our other
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50919:172"/>duties, as well as theſe? Let us not pardon them any thing. Judge we them righteouſly, and with inexorable ſeverity? Chaſtiſe them for all their faults; and bringing them down at the feet of GOD, make them weep and grone in His preſence. Let us reproach them with their ingratitudes, and ſet before their eyes the benefits of GOD, and the offences with which they have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed Him. Denounce we alſo His judgements on them, and the horror of His dreadful vengeance; and not give them over untill they have taken a full and firm reſolution to return no more to their ingratitudes. Above all, Dear Brethren, let us make them hate and deteſt thoſe two peſts, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath to day ſo ſolemnly condemned to dye, to wit, luxury, and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Let us execute his juſt ſentence upon theſe two paſſions, and cauſe them to ſuffer that death which they ſo many waies deſerve. For as to the firſt, it impudently profaneth a body, which belongs to JESUS CHRIST, was redeemed by His blood, waſhed with His heavenly water, fed with His fleſh, and conſecrated by His ſpirit. Rends it from the communion of that divine body, of which it is become a member, to change it into one of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Satan. Bereaves it of its glory, and deſpoils it of the greateſt honour it had; and drawing it out of Heaven, whither GOD had called it, drags it into Hell. I know well, that men of the world flatter themſelves, and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate this ſin. And I am not ignorant, that there are people among our ſelves, who ſuffer themſelves to be corrupted by theſe ſhameleſs ſayings of the world. But why do we call our ſelves Chriſtians, if we preferr the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, or of our own fleſh, before the judgements of GOD? St. <hi>Paul,</hi> beſide what he ſaith of it here, proteſts aloud elſe-where, having ſpoken of adultery,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.21.</note> fornication, and uncleanneſſe, that <hi>they that commit ſuch things,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall not inherit the kingdom of GOD:</hi> And again more formally elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Deceive not your ſelves,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, ſhall inherit the kingdom of GOD.</hi> Renounce either St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or this error of the world. If you perſiſt in it, the Apoſtle cryeth to you, that you deceive your ſelves; that is to ſay, inſtead of Heaven, which you in vain hope for, while you continue in this evil way, you ſhall in the end have hell for your portion, in the communion of devils, whoſe uncleanneſſe you love more than the purity of JESUS CHRIST, and of His Saints. Neither may you plead to us the furiouſneſs of this paſſion. GOD hath provided for it, giving you an honeſt, and a lawful remedy of it, namely, Marriage. Why do ye not uſe it? But the love of libertinizing, and the fear of an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary yoke, and an ambitious humour, with-hold moſt men from thinking on it; who would willingly ſay, what the Doctors of <hi>Rome</hi> have not been aſham'd to write concerning their Prieſts, even that marriage is a greater ſin for them, than fornication; whereby they ſufficiently declare, what opinion they have of this filth, ſince they preferr it before a thing which they rank among the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. But the Epicurians among Pagans, and Monks among Chriſtians, have cried down marriage as much as they could, through a mervaillous arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the enemy of our ſalvation; who rightly judged, that by this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine, he ſhould involve a multitude of people in the vilinies of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, and conſequently in damnation. But if this vice be pernicious, the other, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemneth here, is no leſs ſo. And his not being able to name it, without giving it the title of idolatry, doth evidently ſhew you, what indeed it is. Ye covetous, let this thunderbolt break the charms of your illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Judge what a vice yours is, ſince the Apoſtle calleth it idolatry; and thereupon conceiving a juſt horrour at it, renounce it for ever, and all thoſe low thoughts, in which it buſieth you; to become henceforth liberal, charitable, beneficent, communicative, rich in good works. Inſtead of theſe periſhing goods, which are expoſed to the hands of men, and the injuries of nature, labour to treaſure up a foundation for the time to come; and to get together on high in the Heavens, thoſe true, and immortal riches, which JESUS CHRIST, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Eternity, doth there keep for us, and will one day give us, to enjoy the ſame for ever in ſupreme glory, with Himſelf, and all His Saints, So be it.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; If men had as great a meaſure of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and generoſity, as vertue hath of beauty and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs; there would need no more to induce them to love it, and embrace it; but a repreſenting to them the image of it. This admirable object would quickly raviſh their hearts, and in an inſtant kindle in them a ſweet, and an everlaſting flame of love, which would govern all the motions, and ſentiments of their lives, and conſuming in a ſhort time, the vices, and the fooliſh, or unjuſt paſſions of their nature, fill their deportment with piety, honeſty, and charity. One of thoſe ancient ſages of the world, whom they call Philoſophers, did rightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this truth, notwithſtanding the darkneſſe of his Paganiſm; and ſaid, that if we could ſee vertue naked, that is, as it is in its ſelf, it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our ſouls with a marvellous love to it. For indeed, what is there fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more amiable than virtue? the true, and lively image of GOD, the ſupreme beauty of all beauties? the reſemblance of Angels, the faireſt of all creatures? the only jewel of reaſonable nature? the light of our ſouls? the ornament of our bodies? the advantage of our being above that of animals? the end, and utmoſt perfection of the world? it's juſt, and legitimate gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? this vaſt univerſe having not been made, and formed, but that ſhe might happily poſſeſſe it, governing, and keeping it under her holy, and divine laws? She ſets all our affections in their true poſition, bowing them under the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and raiſing them above the creature. She reduceth all the faculties of our nature to their juſt ſymmetrie, ſubjecting our paſſions to the will, and our will to reaſon. Reſting content with the love of GOD, and the hope of His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhe coveteth no unjuſt thing, and doth no perſon wrong, no, not in deſire
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50919:173"/>and thought; but loveth, and obligeth all men as much as ſhe can, and ſheds abroad continually upon them, the ſweet and innocent rayes of her excellent light; remaining alwaies holy, and juſt, and honeſt without; alwaies calm; and peaceable, and happy within.</p>
                     <p>Who could look upon a thing ſo beautiful, without loving it? accordingly you may obſerve, that where there does appear at any heigth, for inſtance, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the throne of a nation, ſome image of it, though not fully to the lire, nor compleat, and every way entire, but only groſly drawn, and in many reſpects imperfect, yet it fails not to attract the eyes and hearts of the world forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. It proves the love and joy of the preſent generation; and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all poſterity. Men bleſs it; heaven and earth delight in it; and the age that produced it, is glorious by it; one ſingle example of this nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient to adorn a whole countrey, and render the time wherein it flouriſhed, for ever illuſtrious. What then would our raviſhments be, if we beheld the true and accompliſhed effigies of it? in all its lively colours, without defect, and without imperfection? It's true, GOD hath pourtray'd it indeed to the life, in the tables of His Scriptures; But the eyes of our ſouls are ſo bad, that we never comprehend it, but very weakly; and again, our fordidneſſe, and wretchleſneſſe is ſo extreme, that commonly we do not love things according to their inherent beauty, and honeſty; but according to the profit they afford us; and do likewiſe hate things, not ſo much for their deformity, and natural odiouſneſſe, as for the hurt that they may do us. This ignorance, and this mercenary humour, which is common to all men, is a cauſe that our Saviour contemeth not Himſelf with propoſing to us the beauty of holyneſſe, and the deformity and diſorder of ſin, which is the due manner of dealing with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures; but accommodating Himſelf to our infirmity, he inceſſantly ſets before our eyes, the good and the evil that will redound unto us from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, and from ſin, as we ſhall be addicted to the one or the other. He repreſents to us on one hand, the happineſſe to which the Saints are advanced, who obey His will; and on the other hand, the dreadful torments into which vice doth aſſuredly precipitate all the wicked. And though His Spirit doth in part cure this ignorance, and this ſordid diſpoſition in as many as He doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; yet while we are on earth, there do abide ſome reliques of them in us. Whence it comes, that He forbears not to uſe this method, even with the faithful themſelves.</p>
                     <p>You have a notable inſtance of it in this leſſon of the Apoſtle, upon which we now are. For having exhorted us to mortifie our members which are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, that is, to renounce the defilements of luxury, and avarice; for the inclining of us to ſo juſt a duty, he repreſents unto us, in this Text, the judgements of GOD upon the obſtinate ſlaves of theſe vices; They are things (ſaith he) <hi>for which the wrath of GOD cometh upon the children of rebellion.</hi> For he compriſeth, in theſe few words, the fearful and inevitable, but juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven upon all thoſe, who deſpiſing its goodneſſe, do abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the one, or the other of theſe vices. And then, in the following verſe, he ſets afreſh before our eyes, for the ſame purpoſe, the miſerableneſſe of our fore-paſs'd life, which even as the life of children of rebellion, was e're-while ſunk in the turpitude of theſe ſame ſins: and withal, the infinite kindneſs GOD hath done us, in drawing us out thence; <hi>in which things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye alſo walked ſometimes, when ye lived in them.</hi> This he doth, to the end, that being ſeized with a juſt horrour at our former ſtate, and raviſh'd in the ſenſe of our preſent happineſs, we might heartily renounce the ſervice of our former ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and live henceforth in that purity, honeſty, and charity, which this new LORD calleth us unto, who hath vouchſafed to take us to Himſelf, and to ſhed into us a new life, and nature, as diſtant from our former one, as Heaven is from the earth. Now, as theſe are the two reaſons that St. <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth, for the withdrawing of us from thoſe two principal vices of the prophane; ſo ſhall they be (by the will of GOD) the two parts of this action. In the firſt, we will conſider the judgements of GOD upon obſtinate adulterers, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50919:173"/>covetous perſons; and in the ſecond, the miſery of our former ſtate, when we lived in the ſame vices, and could expect nothing in the ſequel, but the ſame effects of the wrath of GOD upon us. The LORD JESUS pleaſe, ſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company our words with the vertue of His bleſſing, that ſuch as the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs, the injuſtice, and horror its ſelf of theſe vices, hath not been yet able to withdraw from them, may now at leaſt be pluck'd from them, by the fear and terror of thoſe dreadful judgements of Heaven, which are unavoidably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all the children of rebellion.</p>
                     <p>The firſt part is expreſſed in theſe words, that <hi>the wrath of GOD cometh for theſe things upon the children of rebellion.</hi> I will not ſtand to tell you, that to ſpeak properly, wrath hath no place in the Divine nature. For who is there of you, but knoweth, that GOD is a Spirit moſt pure, moſt ſimple, and moſt bleſſed, enjoying an infinite calm, and tranquility? whoſe knowledge can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſurpriſed, nor felicity diſturbed, as we learn, both from Scripture, and from reaſon it ſelf? Now wrath, and ſuch other paſſions, do conſiſt in the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and emotion of the blood, and of the ſpirits that ſtir it; they being cauſed in us by our imagination, diverſly, as the objects which it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, are troubleſome, or contentful, preſent, or to come; the one producing in us ſorrow, others joy; ſome, fear; and others, hope; thoſe of one ſort, wrath; thoſe of another, contentment, or complacency. None of this as you ſee, can arrive, but where there is ſome mixture of humors, and ſpirits, which being not in GOD at all, whoſe eſſence is moſt ſimple, it is alſo impoſſible that any of theſe paſſions ſhould take place in Him; and leaſt of all, wrath, which is one of the moſt troubled, and moſt boyling of them. But the Scripture, which uſeth the dialect of children with us, as with children, doth often attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute theſe paſſions unto GOD, figuratively, to repreſent thus groſly the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Him, under the images of thoſe things that are familiar with us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they belong properly to our nature. It's thus we muſt underſtand that, which it calls the wrath of GOD. For it ſignifieth by this term, not the perturbation of a commoved Spirit, which cannot be in GOD, becauſe of the ſoveraign perfection of His nature; but a juſt and reaſonable will to puniſh the perſon that deſerves it. This it termeth wrath, by reaſon of ſome reſemblance that appears to be between theſe two things. For a man who is in wrath, doth eagerly deſire to avenge himſelf upon the perſon that troubles him; and he doth it, if it be in his power, cauſing him diſpleaſure, and afflicting him. So doth GOD treat thoſe who violate his laws; He makes them ſuffer evil, and puniſheth, or chaſtiſeth them, according to their deſerts. But He doth it without any perturbation, with a calm, and compoſed will; whereas a man in wrath doth it with emotion. And becauſe we are ſeldome wont to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, there being few that avenge themſelves without ſome trouble, and boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of choler, it ſeems to us that it is ſo with the LORD too. Wherefore we ſay, He is angry, when He avengeth His laws, and puniſheth the crimes of His creatures; though at the bottom, and in very deed, there be nothing in His action, but the purpoſe, and effect of an avengement, and not the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of any paſſion. Thence it comes, that the Scripture alſo ſpeaketh in like manner, frequently attributing wrath, in this ſenſe, unto GOD. And if you narrowly heed it, you will find, that it gives this name either to the will that GOD hath to puniſh men, the arreſt and order He paſſeth for it; or to the effects themſelves, that follow thereupon, that is, the puniſhments He makes culpable perſons ſuffer by His order. And it's in this ſecond ſenſe, the Apoſtle intends it here, when He ſaith, that <hi>the wrath of GOD cometh upon the children of rebellion.</hi> The wrath, that is, the avenges of GOD, His judgements, the evils, and executions, wherewith He puniſheth their rebellion, according to the decrees of His avenging juſtice. He ſpeaks in the ſame manner elſe-where, when he ſaith, that <hi>the wrath of GOD is openly re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Others underſtand it of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment He will inflict for them at the laſt day: and indeed, the Scripture doth frequently ſo ſpeak of that great judgement, and the things which ſhall be done in it, ſaying, that it cometh; elegantly ſignifying by that word, the certainty, and infallible coming to paſs of a thing, which, 'tis true, as yet is not, but will not fail to be; as if it were a perſon that travelled, and were already on the way to go to the place where he would arrive. But I conceive the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth encloſe within this word, the execution of both thoſe kinds of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſignifying by it, thoſe great and dreadful torments, into which God will plunge the wicked, on the day of His anger, which will be the laſt effect of His wrath againſt fin; and alſo all the chaſtenings wherewith He ſcourgeth them in this life, which are, as it were, the firſt-fruits of His wrath, and ſo many ſamples and fore-runners of His final vengeance. St. <hi>Paul</hi> compriſeth all this, in his ſaying, that <hi>the wrath of GOD cometh.</hi> But this form of ſpeech, even that the wrath of GOD cometh upon men, is graceful, and eximious, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, that the evils which arrive on earth, do not happen at adventure, nor ſpring out of the earth it ſelf, and their inferiour cauſes ſimply, but do iſſue from another ſource, to wit, from Heaven, which pours them down here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as a ſtorm, or deluge, for the inevitable enveloping, and overwhelming of thoſe for whom they are appointed. They ſet forth from Heaven; they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel towards us, and fall whom in the end upon the heads of evil-doers, by the order of the moſt High, who marks out the whole courſe they are to take, and diſpenſeth them with the ſame judgment, that He doth thunders, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, and rains, which come upon us from on high, by the guidance of His providence. And as you ſee it is, for the moſt part, in the works of nature, that theſe meteors do not come on a ſudden, but after ſome ſigns that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, and preſage their approach: in like manner is it ordinarily with the judgments of GOD. The thunder of His wrath, as well as that of nature, doth roar before it falls. GOD threatens the guilty before He ſtrikes them down, and well-nigh alwaies ſendeth men ſome advertiſements, that are as the van-coureurs, and harbingers of His wrath, to prepare us, that we may either divert it, by preventing it through our repentance, or take it to abide with us.

He obſerves the ſame order ſtill in His chaſtiſing of families, and nations; ſcarce ever involving them in any calamity, but He ſignified to them the coming of it, before He executeth it; which may be noted, among others, in thoſe horrible ſcourges, which have made havock in Chriſtendome for theſe eight and twenty or thirty years.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle addeth, who they are, upon whom the wrath of GOD doth come; <hi>upon the children</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of rebellion.</hi> It's an Hebrew manner of ſpeech, familiar in the Scriptures of the one and the other Teſtament, to call that man, the child of a thing, who is addicted to it, and hath in him the impreſſion, and tincture of it; as they call Antichriſt, the Son of perdition, that is to ſay, a loſt man, one devoted, and abandoned to perdition, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys himſelf in deſtroying others. And the Grecians, whoſe language is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely poliſht, and perfectly well formed, have not however diſdained this form of expreſſion, ſaying often the children of the Grecians, for to ſignifie, Greeks themſelves: and the children of Phyſicians, for Phyſicians. In like manner here, theſe children of rebellion, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, are the rebellious; ſuch as diſobey the will of GOD, and His advertiſements; fiercely

They remained obſtinate in this profane ſecurity, untill a deluge of fire and brimſtone, pouring in a moment out of Heaven upon them, and upon their abominable Countrey, forced thoſe dreams of their incredulity out of their heads, and taught them, that there is nothing more true than the word of GOD, nor more falſe than an imagination of the ſecurity of ſinners. In fine, it is the crime of all thoſe, upon whom the wrath of GOD doth fall. They are children of rebellion, to whom may be applied (though to ſome more, to others leſs) what a Prophet ſometime ſaid unto the Jews,
<note place="margin">Zech. 7.11.</note> They would not underſtand, but have pulled away the ſhoulder, and made their ears heavy, that they might not hear, and have hardned their hearts as an adamant, that they might not hearken to the law, and the words which the LORD of Hoſts ſent by His Spirit.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge, that this is properly the crime, firſt, of thoſe who reject the Goſpel of the Son of GOD, the true word brought in by the Holy Spirit: and ſecondly, of them, that living under the Moſaique covenant, rebelled againſt the word of GOD preached to them by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. But I affirm, that even they are not exempt of it, who have ſinned, or do ſin, in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Paganiſm. For though theſe people do not reject the word either of the Goſpel, or the Law, which is neither the one nor the other, addreſſed to them; yet can they not be excuſed of contemning that other voice of GOD, which makes it ſelf be heard from Heaven throughout all the earth, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſecretly in every man's heart, and privily calleth them to repentance for their ſins, to piety, to honeſty, to juſtice, and rectitude. They profanely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this ſacred declaration of the Deity, without which GOD never left a man among the nations, no, not the moſt forlorn, or moſt deſperately plunged in idolatry and viciouſneſſe, as the Apoſtle teacheth us in the <hi>Acts.</hi> They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe thoſe admirable directions He gives them in the governing of the world, to <hi>ſeek Him, feel Him and find Him.</hi>

Whence appears the wonderfulneſſe, not only of the juſtice, but even of the gentleneſs, and benignity of GOD, who having right to puniſh men upon the firſt ſin, they are ſound guilty of, yet doth it not; but calleth, and inviteth them to repentance, and waiteth for them, and cauſeth not His wrath to come upon them, untill to the crime of their ſin, they have added that of rebellion againſt that ſecond way of ſalvation, which He in His loving kindneſs offers them; to wit, the way of repentance. For that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith here of fornicators, and the avaricious in particular, is true of all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in general; the wrath of Heaven cometh not upon them that are guilty, but

And the goodneſſe of GOD doth ſo much the more gloriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this procedure of His towards them, for that to have the liberty of treating thus with them, He bought it (if I may ſo ſpeak) at the price of the blood of His only Son, whom He (ſuch is His goodneſſe to us) deliver'd up to the death of the Croſs, to ſalve the intereſts of His juſtice, which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this way of mercy, that He inclined to open unto men after their falling into ſin. But this very thing ſhews us on the other hand, how great the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of men is, and how untractable the furiouſneſſe of the paſſion they have for vice; in that not content to be debauched from the ſervice of their Soveraign, (which is of it ſelf an horrible attentat, and worthy of a thouſand penalties) they are ſo deſperately in love with ſin, that to continue in it, they deſpiſe, and even reject, with an enraged inſolency, all this holy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred myſterie of the kindneſſe of GOD; and are ſo inchanted, and beſtialized by the poiſons of ſin, that they preferr its ſhort, its vain, and wretched plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, before Divine grace and ſalvation, and do leſs dread the wrath of their Soveraign, and the ſociety of Devils, and the torments of Hell, than the loſs of that unworthy and ſhameful delight, which the practiſe of ſin, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of its luſts, doth give them for a few daies.</p>
                     <p>But we may further obſerve here, the Apoſtle's holy art; who aiming to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> from avarice, and the pollution of carnal pleaſures, doth not tell them, that GOD will puniſh them heavily, if they do not avoid them: (this language would have in ſome ſort offended them, as implying that they had ſome inclination or diſpoſition to ſuch a faultineſſe.) On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, preſuppoſing, that this would not betide them; to give them horror at theſe crimes, he ſhews them the juſt puniſhments of them, in the perſon of the unbelieving, and rebellious; like a tender and a prudent father, who to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print an hatred of vice and debauch in the heart of his child, chaſtiſeth the ſlaves in his preſence, that the example of thoſe vile and wretched perſons may teach him what puniſhments he will deſerve, if he come to fall into any ſuch diſorder, he, who is the ſon of his houſe, the heir of his freedom, and eſtate. For we muſt not fancy, that becauſe we have the honour to be of the alliance of GOD, we may therefore commit with impunity thoſe ſins, which the LORD puniſheth ſo ſeverely in thoſe that are without. Far from us be ſo fottiſh, and ſo pernicious a conceit; It's vice that GOD hateth, and not perſons; and whoever hardens himſelf therein, live he in any profeſſion, Pagan or Chriſtian, reformed or otherwiſe, he is a child of rebellion; and the advantage and excellency of the profeſſion he makes, is ſo far from exempting him from, that it will aggravate his puniſhment; it being moſt juſt, as our Saviour teacheth us,
<note place="margin">Luke 12.47.</note> that <hi>he who knew the will of his Maſter, and doth it not, ſhould receive more ſtripes,</hi> than he that offends ignorantly. And when a true believer ſalleth, through infirmity, into ſome one of theſe diſorders, (as alas! happens but too often) GOD plainly ſhews, how much it doth diſpleaſe Him, never failing to rebuke and chaſten it, except a prompt repentance do prevent ſuch chaſtening of His.

After he yielded up himſelf to this infamous paſſion, he ſo loſt all that force of ſpirit and judgement, that he became extravagant to ſuch a degree, as to give up himſelf to idolatry, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all bruitalities, in complacency to his Miſtreſſes. And the Heathen Poets themſelves, to repreſent what the ordinary ſequel of this vice is, do make one of their Heroes aſſume, in their fables, the habit, and equipage of a woman, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had once fallen into the ſnares of this wretched paſſion. It's an image of what doth ſtill betide thoſe that let themſelves be taken in the ſame: putting off by little and little, all vertue, and ſhame, they become effeminate, and ſo utterly loſe their ſenſes, that at length there is nothing ſo diſgraceful, nothing ſo contrary to order, honour, and decency, but they readily do, and ſuffer.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50919:176"/>The ſame is ſignified again by another fable of the ſame Author's, concerning ſome, whom the potion of a ſorcereſſe transformed into ſwine, and other beaſts. The fable is pregnant of truth, and under feigned names and perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the hiſtory of the moſt part of thoſe miſerable men, whom fornication and adultery hath bewitched. They loſe heart, and judgement, and humane ſenſe, and commit ſo many follies and extravagancies, as it is very eaſie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that it's no longer the foul of a man, but of a meer animal, that guides them. Whence then comes ſo ſtrange a Metamorphoſis, even in a <hi>Solomon,</hi> and in perſons that otherwiſe ſeemed ſo advis'd, and prudent? Dear Brethren, doubt not, but that it comes from a ſecret judgement of GOD, who deprives them of that ſpirit and judgement which they made ſuch ill uſe of, and who, ſo to ſay, degrading them of the quality of men, whereof this vice hath rendred them unworthy,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> drives them out among animals, delivering them up unto a mind disfurniſhed of judgement, as the Apoſtle doth elſe-where deſcribe this dreadful vengeance of GOD.</p>
                     <p>But beſides mind and reaſon, who ſees not, that it alſo uſually takes away their ſtrength, their beauty, their vigour, and health of body, bringing on them diſeaſes, which gnaw their very bones, diſeaſes which rot them, and incurvate them before the time, and which creating ſharpeſt pains in all the parts of their miſerable fleſh, do make it pay dear for the diſhoneſt pleaſures they have given it? Loſs of goods is alſo one of the puniſhments which GOD commonly infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth for this ſin, permitting its very ſelf to conſume, by the irregularity of its fooliſh expences, the means that are neceſſary for the ſupport of the life of man; and reduce thoſe that ſerve it, to an incommodious and ſhameful pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whereto may be yet added infinite examples, which the lives of men are full of, of tragical miſeries, wherewith GOD doth viſibly ſtrike ſins of this ſort. It was for them, that He ſent the firſt deluge of water on the earth; and afterwards again, a ſecond of fire and brimſtone upon the coaſts of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> The debauches of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>Moah</hi> were the cauſe of the death of four and twenty thouſand men, whom GOD conſumed in His fury. And the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſo great and flouriſhing as it had been, was reduced to ſix hundred men, for the uncleanneſs of one of their Cities. Who knows not, that ſometimes one man's adultery hath cauſed long wars, and ruined great Eſtates? And among the inſtances of it, particularly lamentable is that of the <hi>Gothes</hi> Empire; which having flouriſhed in <hi>Spain</hi> a long time, was deſtroyed, and utterly overthrown, for a fault of this kind committed by one of their Kings. This occaſion brought in the <hi>Saracens</hi> upon their hands; who, beſides liberty, and goods, took Chriſtian religion away too, from the moſt part of thoſe people; introducing, and maintaining Mahometiſm in thoſe Countreys, during many ages.

The accidents of particular houſes, and perſons infected with this leaprouſie, are leſs marked; yet are they never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs very remarkable. And he that ſhall look narrowly into them, ſhall find in them admirable examples of the juſtice of GOD upon theſe kind of ſins; and this in ſpecial, that He commonly takes away His covenant from houſes where ſuch diſorders reign. I might eaſily let you ſee like foot-ſteps of the wrath of GOD upon the covetous, whoſe unrighteouſneſſe He often puniſheth with loſs of ſenſes, of health, of honour, and of that very wealth which they love much better than their bodies, and their ſouls themſelves; not to ſpeak of the infamy which GOD ſometimes poureth out upon them; and the horrible miſeries into which He lets them fall, in their perſons, and in their poſterity.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt paſs to the other part of this Text, and ſpeak a few words of it, and conclude. For the Apoſtle, after this wrath of GOD, which he hath repreſented, as falling from Heaven upon the children of rebellion, becauſe of their pollutions, and avarices, reminds the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that themſelves had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time been in the ſame condition; <hi>in which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you alſo walked other-while,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50919:176"/>when ye lived in theſe things.</hi> To live in theſe ſins, is to have the principles of our life infected with the venome of them. To walk in them, is to produce the actions of them. The one is the power and faculty of life; the other is the exerciſe and function of it. For the having in ones ſelf the principles and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life, this the Apoſtle termeth living, and by walking, he underſtands, a putting forth the actions of the ſame; as appears plainly by his ſaying elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit.</hi> For a man, that,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.25.</note> for inſtance, is aſleep, does nevertheleſs live, and hath life, though he performeth not the actions of it. As therefore to live in the Spirit, is no other thing, but to have the faculties and powers of our nature renewed, and as it were new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, and regenerated by the vertue of the Spirit of JESUS CHRIST; ſo on the contrary, to live in ſin, is in like manner, to have our underſtanding, and will, and the other powers of our nature, putrified, and corrupted, and, as it were, empoiſoned with <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, by the contagion of his fleſh. And again, as thoſe do walk in the Spirit, who exerciſe piety, and ſanctity, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct all the actions and motions of their lives, according to the will of the Spirit; ſo they, on the contrary, walk in ſin, who follow, and fulfill the luſts thereof, and employ themſelves in no other exerciſe, but the ſerving it, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe evil works which naturally flow from the habitudes of it. But we have ſpoken largely heretofore, if you remember, of this firſt life of old <hi>Adam,</hi> which the grace of the LORD JESUS hath deſtroyed, and mortified in us. We have only to obſerve in our way, that ſince the exerciſe of man, in his ſtate of nature before grace, is, to walk in vices, and in groſſeſt pollutions; it muſt be an huge error to imagine, that he ſhould be able, in ſuch a ſtate, to produce works either meritorious, (as ſome ſay) or preparatory to grace, (as others do pretend.) All he doth for this time, if you believe the Apoſtle in the caſe, is not good, but to prepare for Hell, and merit the wrath of GOD; and to have any other opinion of it, will be a diminution of the greatneſſe of the grace of GOD towards us. Let us think then, Beloved Brethren, on that ſhameful and miſerable eſtate in which we naturally were, and ſhould have continued for ever with the children of rebellion, living, and walking in ſins, the wages, and fruit whereof, could be no other than eternal death, if the LORD, through His abundant grace, had not delivered us from ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. And reſenting, as we ought, the greatneſs of the benefit He hath conferr'd upon us, let us inceſſantly bleſs His mercy and goodneſs; Thanks be ever rendred unto thee, O holy, and merciful LORD, for that we being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſin, thou haſt made us free by Thy Son, and given us by thy Spirit,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.17.</note> to obey that expreſs form of doctrine, which hath been delivered us by thy ſervants.</p>
                     <p>But as heretofore the vices, in which we lived, did continually produce all kind of pollutions, and ſins; and henceforth, ſince the croſs, and grace of our LORD hath dried up this ſource of impurity, let there no more appear any track of them in our manners. Let the holyneſs of that new man, whoſe name and blood we boaſt of, ſhine forth in all the actions of our lives. Above all, let us baniſh thence, thoſe two capital and accurſed peſts of luxury and avarices for which, you have heard here before, all the mouths of Heaven opened, to fulminate againſt the rebellious, that ſerve them, the curſes of this world, and of that which is to come. And if the ignorance of ſuch as lived in error, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held not the wrath of GOD heretofore from coming on them for theſe two kinds of ſins; what muſt thoſe expect now, who commit the ſame crimes in the light of JESUS CHRIST? Sure, as much as the diſobedience, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the one is more grievous, and more enormous than that of others; ſo much more terrible will be the wrath that ſhall pour from Heaven upon them, than all the judgements of GOD the world hath ſeen in time paſt. Your ingratitude, Chriſtian, who ſo ill brook your name, and your diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſurpaſſeth in horridneſſe all the unbelief, both of the firſt world, and of ancient <hi>Iſrael:</hi> they rejected, but the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the miniſtry of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You know, the abyſſe opened its mouth to ſwallow up the others alive; Heaven, and earth, and the elements were armed againſt them. If their puniſhment makes you tremble; why do you imitate their faults? yea, why commit you ſuch as are more hainous, and blacker than theirs?

But the LORD JESUS, whom we invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, pleaſe to give us better things; ſo reforming this Church by the power of His Spirit, and of His voice, that henceforth theſe crying ſins be no more ſeen amongſt us; not the ordures of luxury, nor the vilinies of avarice, which are the infamy of His people, the reproach of our profeſſion, the ſcandal of ſuch as are without, the ſhame of thoſe that are within, the ruine and eternal miſery of thoſe that obſtinately continue in theſe vices.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; The Philoſophers have well obſerved, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonancy to truth, as each of us may perceive in himſelf by our own experience, that beſides underſtanding and will, there are in the ſouls of men two other inferior powers, one of which deſires thoſe pleaſing things that ſenſe preſents it; and the other fleeth from, and avoideth thoſe that look troubleſome. In the barbarous language of the ſchools, the former is called the concupiſcible, and the latter the iraſcible. They both were given us by the Creator, for the benefit of our nature; to ſerve us, as two goads, which might prick, and move us, the one to ſeek, and acquire what is profitable for it; the other, to repell what is contrary to it. And in the primitive and legitimate conſtitution of our being, each of theſe two powers exactly obeying reaſon, they had nothing in their motions, but what was good and juſt. Afterwards ſin ſupervening, by our fall, did put them into an huge diſorder; reaſon, which had loſt its dominion, leaving them both without conduct, and moſt commonly favouring their errors, inſtead of correcting them. For now deſire embraceth any guſtful thing that is preſented; and anger is ſtirred up againſt any thing that ſeems diſpleaſing; indifferently, without heeding, or following the judgement of right reaſon; whence do proceed the greateſt part of the ſins and miſeries of the life of man. Accordingly you ſee, that the principal task of thoſe that would reform our manners, is to labour above all things in the rectifying of theſe two powers of our ſouls, and for the reducing of them ſweetly under the yoke of reaſon, that neither of them may ever move its ſelf, but as it commandeth, or permitteth. Our Apoſtle therefore, having undertaken here, to give the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and all other believers, which ſhall read this Epiſtle, the form of that ſanctity, to which the diſcipline of our LORD JESUS CHRIST doth oblige us, took care at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to correct the actions and motions of the one, and the other of theſe two powers. He began with concupiſcence, enjoyning us, to mortifie all that's vitious
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50919:178"/>in it, and religiouſly abſtain from its principal exceſſes, which are the ordures of carnal pleaſures, and of avarice. To this end he hath minded us of thoſe inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table puniſhments which this kind of diſorders doth ever draw down from Heaven upon the children of rebellion; that if the juſtneſs of the thing it ſelf cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, at leaſt the fear of puniſhment may retain us in our duty. Having thus purged our concupiſcence, he cometh next unto wrath; and in the verſe that we have read, does faithfully adviſe us, to mortifie likewiſe the paſſions thereof, and all the evils they produce: that our lives may be not only pure, and honeſt; but alſo innocent, calm, and peaceful, and truly worthy of that JESUS CHRIST, of whom we make profeſſion, the ſupreme pattern of ſweetneſs, and benignity. <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye alſo put off all theſe things, wrath, anger, maliciouſneſs, detraction, and diſhoneſt ſpeech out of your mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You plainly ſee, that theſe things which he commandeth us to put off, are five in all; <hi>Wrath, anger, maliciouſneſs, detraction, and diſhoneſt ſpeech.</hi> The four firſt, are either kinds, or effects of one and the ſame paſſion, even that which we call wrath. The laſt referrs to ſomewhat elſe; nevertheleſs he ranks it here with the other, for a reaſon you ſhall hear anon. This is the ſubject we will treat of in this action, by the will of GOD. Only before our coming to it, conſidering that there is nothing ſuperfluous, or uſeleſs in this holy Apoſtle's language, we muſt diſcover in ſhort, the meaning, and reaſon of thoſe words with which he begins his exhortation. <hi>But now ye alſo put off all theſe things.</hi> They depend upon the precedent verſe, to which they moſt evidently referr. St. <hi>Paul</hi> did there put the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> in mind of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient eſtate, under the darkneſſe of Paganiſm, before the Goſpel had ſhone on them. At that time (ſaid he to them) you wallowed in the ordures of avarice, and luxury, as well as other children of the generation: Ye walked, and lived in theſe things. When therefore he comes to add here; <hi>But now put ye off all theſe things,</hi> it is clear, that he oppoſeth to the time of their fore-paſt ignorance, the time of their preſent knowledge; their faith to their error; their Chriſtianity to their Paganiſm; the day to the night, and the light to darkneſs; and by this means, he repreſents to them one reaſon, to induce them to their duty, drawn from their preſent eſtate. For every thing, as the Wiſe man ſheweth, hath its time, and every ſeaſon its bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. The actions of the day are of one ſort, and thoſe of the night another; and a thing that becomes childhood, is not ſufferable in riper years. While you were in the darkneſs of Paganiſm, that groſs ignorance you lived in, rendred your vices leſs ſtrange, and more excuſable, ſaith the Apoſtle. Now, that you live in the light of JESUS CHRIST, with what excuſe can you cover your faults any longer? The laws and cuſtoms of this Divine Kingdom, into which He hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you, are quite different from thoſe of Paganiſm, which you have renounced. Be content to have eſcaped out of them, and let it ſuffice you, to have wretchedly loſt ſo many years in the vices of ignorance, and to have ſo long fulfilled the will of the Gentiles. Now that GOD hath graciouſly brought you to quit their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, quit alſo their vices, and henceforth regulate your manners by the light which ſhines about you. Have no more commerce with their works, ſince JESUS CHRIST hath brought you out of their darkneſs. The Apoſtle, in another place, explains this reaſon more at length, which he doth here but touch in a word. <hi>The night is paſs'd,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 13.12. 1 Theſ 5.6. 2 Cor. 5.17.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>and the day is come on. Let us therefore caſt off the works of darkneſs, and put on the armour</hi> (that is, the garments) <hi>of light; You are all children of light, and of the day. We are not of the night, nor of darkneſs. Old things are paſſed away; behold all things are become new.</hi> Beloved Brethren, Would to GOD we had this conſideration alwaies before our eyes! It would be ſufficient to divert us from the vices of the world, unto which we ſuffer our ſelves to be ſo eaſily carried. For if they rendred us guilty of death, when we practiſed them in the darkneſs of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; of what hells, and maledictions ſhall we not be worthy, if we commit them now? Now that we live in the light of the Goſpel? in the communion of Saints and Angels? Who ſees not, that if we live ill, all theſe great advantages will turn to our miſery? and that the glory we have to know GOD, and His CHRIST, will ſerve to no end, but the aggravating the guilt, and augmenting the puniſhment of our ſins? Let us then, Chriſtians, beware of abuſing the gifts of GOD. Let us lead a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50919:178"/>life worthy of the condition to which He hath called us, and of the age to which He hath advanced us; and following the counſel of His Apoſtle, now, that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace, in the kingdom of holyneſſe, let us put off all theſe baſe luſts, which belong only to that eſtate of errour and ignorance which we are come out of.</p>
                     <p>The word which we have tranſlated, put off, ſignifyeth ſimply, lay by, or, caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you; as when a man throws down a fardle he was loaden with; and ſo our Bibles have rendred it, in the thirteenth chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 13.16.</note> where the Apoſtle hath us'd it; <hi>Let us caſt off the works of darkneſs.</hi> And it ſeems, it would not have been amiſs to take it ſo in the place before us; becauſe it immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and diſhoneſt ſpeech out of your mouth; in regard whereof, the word put off is harſh, as you may well perceive. But this concerns the words only. The ſenſe remains the ſame ſtill, even that we rid our ſelves of all the paſſions of vice, and cleanſe our ſouls, our ſenſes, and our mouths of them, and (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks elſe-where, uſing again the ſame word) <hi>caſt off all this heavy and killing load of the ſins of the world.</hi> We may not forget the word, (alſo;) <hi>ye alſo put off all theſe things.</hi> Some referr it to other believers, who endeavour after true ſanctification; as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's meaning were, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> ſhould do the like. But nothing appearing in the Text, on which ſuch a conceit may be founded, I account it better to referr it, either to the preſent ſtate of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> which required, that as they had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles walked in vice, ſo they ſhould now renounce it; or (which ſeems to me more fluent) to the paſſions whereof he had ſpoken. Beſides fornication, and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>put off alſo all theſe things,</hi> (ſaith he) to wit, <hi>wrath, and detraction,</hi> of which he comes to ſpeak. For indeed, friend, if you would be truly a Chriſtian, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that you rid your ſelf of one vice. You muſt alſo break with all the reſt; as for reſtoring you to health, it's not ſufficient to cure you of one maladie; you muſt be heal'd of all, it being clear, that while any one remains upon you, you may, 'tis true, be leſs ſick, than you were when you had many others with it; but for all that, you will not be in health. Accordingly for the being a true Chriſtian, a diſciple of the Spirit, and one of GOD's houſhold, there's need of being delivered from all vices, and not from ſome only. If you had mortified in you the paſſions of luxury, and avarice; I acknowledge, it is much. But yet it is not all. Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>it alſo thoſe of wrath, and detraction, ſince they alone are ſufficient to deſtroy you, though you have none other. This is the inſtruction the Apoſtle doth here give us; where having ordered us to mortifie the former of thoſe vices, he addeth; <hi>Caſt off alſo all theſe things, wrath, anger, malice, detruction, diſhoneſt ſpeech out of your mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The two firſt of theſe five words referr to one and the ſame paſſion, which we do but too well know, and indifferently call, in our tongue, either wrath, or anger. But in the language the Apoſtle uſeth, there is this difference, that the firſt of theſe words (which we have rendred wrath) doth properly import a firm, and fixed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revenge. The other, which we have tranſlated anger, or indignation, is the firſt trouble which ariſeth in us, when we enter into choler; that fire, which on a ſudden kindleth in our ſpirits, and heating, and agitating our blood, makes it boil about our hearts. One is the beginning, and the other the form, and conſiſtency of the paſſion. One is the firſt guſt of the ſtorm; the other, the continuation of it. The one enkindles; the other burns our hearts. The one puts fire to them; the other keeps it in. I confeſs, this firſt boyling up of indignation, is a leſs evil than formed wrath; but notwithſtanding, it's an evil. Wherefore the Apoſtle would have us clear our ſelves of them both. That malice which he adds in the third place, is alſo, in my opinion, a certain kind of anger. I know well, the word is of a great extent, and ſignifies in general, that venome, and evil of ſin, which is diffuſed through any one of our paſſions, which ſoever it be. But here, as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elſe-where, I ſuppoſe, it's taken for the malignity of anger; when a miſchievous and vindicative ſtomach broods on its paſſion inwardly, and feeds its fire under the aſhes, hatching ſome ill turn for the perſon it aims at, and waiting for opportunity to break out. Such a man works under ground, as miners do, and appears not, till the ruine he prepareth for his enemy be fully ready. His paſſion is like a ſtinted fire, that doth not burn up untill its ſeaſon. Of all kinds of anger, there is none
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50919:179"/>more black, and malignant in its ſelf; nor more noxious, or pernicious in its effects. Wherefore the Apoſtle calls it malice, naughtineſſe, or malignity, particularly; and it ſeems to be the ſame thing he elſe-where calls bitterneſſe, when treating of the ſame ſubject, he ſaith, <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.3.</note> 
                        <hi>be put away from among you, with all malice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle's indication of our duty, is not obſcure; and it would be loſs of time to ſpend any more about explanation of it. The ſumm of all is, that we pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it, and labour in the thing, each of us in good earneſt. For the evil that this holy man would take away from among us, is ſo common with us, as ſcarce a perſon is to be found exempted from it. I confeſs, it's a great, and almoſt incredible ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, that man, who was created for humanity, and whom nature ſeems not to have form'd, but for ſweetneſſe, and courteſie, and gentleneſs, ſhould be ſo corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that there is no animal in the world more fierce, more furious, and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant; the poiſon of ſerpents, the paws of lions, and the tusks of wild boars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not more to be feared, than moſt mens choler. I confeſs alſo, it is yet a much greater ſhame, that Chriſtians, whom the diſcipline, whom the ſpirit, and example of their Maſter, ſhould have transformed into ſheep, and lambs, that is, into crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without gall, and void of aſperity; that they, I ſay, ſhould be as much, or more ſubject to the furies of this paſſion, than men of the world, bred up, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned in the ſchool of vanity and error. But however ſhameful this default be, we are conſtrained, by very evidence of things, to acknowledge, that it is plainly common among us. There are houſholds, where this <hi>Demon</hi> of anger governs all at its pleaſure, inceſſantly troubling the concord of husband and wife, the union of parents and children, and the peace of maſters and ſervants. There is nothing done, nothing ſaid, but in choler. You would ſay of theſe houſes, that they are the fabled cavern of <hi>Eolus,</hi> where the winds, that are ſhut up in it, are heard night and day, roaring, and tempeſting. There is no climate, no ſea, no coaſt in all the earth, where ſtorms are greater, or more ordinary. For whereas natural tempeſts do happen but at ſome ſeaſons of the year; in theſe miſerable houſes, no calm is ever ſeen; and there needs but one petty action, one word, yea, one look, to raiſe ſtorms of many daies continuance: as they ſay of certain lakes in the mountains of <hi>Bearn:</hi> that if one caſt but a ſtone into them, all the air about becomes turbid, and is immediately fill'd with winds, and clouds, which ſoon break out into lightning, and thunders, and exceſſive rain. Yea, ſome there are, whoſe paſſion is ſo violent, that is cannot be kept within the encloſure of their houſes. It iſſues out at doors, and without reſpect to the faces of them that paſs by, without apprehenſion of ſcandal, audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſhews it ſelf in publick, and acteth its tragedies in the preſence of all the world. Our angers will ſometimes have even theſe ſacred places for witneſſes; in which they are not aſhamed to make themſelves ſeen, and to utter the greateſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and provocatious they can form before the eyes of this holy company, in the ſight of GOD, and His Angels. And though this paſſion hath alwaies had, but too free courſe among us, I muſt yet needs ſay, My Brethren, that quarels, injuries, blows, batteries, even to the ſhedding of blood, were never ſeen ſo ſrequent, as for a while of late. O GOD! how can it be, that the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST, which is ſo aſſiduouſly, and ſo faithfully preach'd unto you, ſhould have ſo little force upon you? ſhould not only fail, to plant in your ſouls, that coeleſtial and angelical ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which it had to produce; but be unable ſo much as to reſtrain your carriage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of ſome ſhamefac'dneſs, and decency? We are Chriſtians, and do things which honeſt men of the world, which diſciples of heathen Philoſophy would not have done. If they have not more holineſs than we; ſure they have at leaſt more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                     <p>But I forbear complaints, Dear Brethren; though, in truth, if there be any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, wherein grief, and emotion, and anger it ſelf may be permitted, without doubt it might in this. Come we to the thing it ſelf, and condemning each of us for his own particular, the faults, into which anger hath heretofore tranſported us, amend for the future, and ſtudiouſly apply our ſelves to cure our ſouls of this paſſion. Let us give our ſouls no reſt untill we have purged our hearts of the gall that's in them, and tempered, and ſeaſoned them with the ſweetneſs and gentleneſs of our LORD
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50919:179"/>and Saviour. When we perceive in our ſelves, or in our children, ſome diſtemper of the liver apt to breed diſeaſes; or but ſome ill habitude, a bending, or other action of body, contrary to the decency of converſation, we do our utmoſt to correct it, and there is nothing but we ſubmit to, for the attaining of our end. Would to GOD we were as careful to cure inclinations, and paſſions contrary to an heavenly life. I durſt ſay, that we ſhould not ſpend three moneths in ſuch diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but we ſhould, if not wholly mortifie, at leaſt very much mitigate, and tame this fierce and cruel choler, which cauſeth ſo many miſchiefs in the Church, and in the world. Though there were nothing but the Apoſtle's prohibition, which ſo expreſly ordereth us to quit, and put off all the kinds of wrath, this alone might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to give us an abhorrence of it. But the uglineſs, and venome of the thing it ſelf, if we conſider the ſame ever ſo little, will clearly juſtifie this holy man's injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and force us to confeſs, that though he had ſaid nothing of it, our own intereſt would oblige us, to do of our own accord, what he enjoyns us. For behold, I pray, what ſpoil this paſſion makes in the ſouls, and in the bodies, and in the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe poor men whom it ſeizeth on. Firſt, at the entrance, it perturbeth their judgement, and extinguiſheth the light of their underſtanding; and ſpreading its poiſonous vapours through all the faculties of their mind, leaves them no clear ſight of any thing. In this agitation they conceive nothing, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>th perturbation, and ſee nothing but under ſtrange colours. They no longer diſcern a friend from an enemie; they forget reſpect; they loſe modeſty, and ſhame. It's no longer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that guides them; but rage, and impetuouſneſs thruſt them on, and carry them headlong. They are no longer men. Choler hath transform'd them into beaſts, or devils. The very heathen well obſerv'd it, ſaying, as we ſtill read in their books, that this paſſion is a ſhort madneſſe, that it differs from madneſſe in nothing, but that is, it is of leſs duration. And the Holy Ghoſt makes the ſame judgement of it, when he pronounceth in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> that <hi>anger reſteth in the boſome of fools;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccl. 7.9.</note> and elſe-where He puts among the marks of a prudent diſcreet man,
<note place="margin">Prov. 12.16.</note> that <hi>He reſtrains his wrath,</hi> and as he expreſſeth it, <hi>covereth his ignominy;</hi> juſtly calling the follies, and extravagancies, which this paſſion makes us commit, our ignominie.</p>
                     <p>For it ſtops not at that diſorder which it creates within us. It ſoon breaks out, and diſcovers its horridneſſe. For that blood which it hath heated, and made to boil about our hearts, ruſhing forth to the external parts; gives a new tincture to the countenance, and defacing its natural, and ordinary form, and covering it, as we may ſay, with a ſtrange and hideous mask, ſhews it us quite different from what it was before. The man hath no longer his ordinary eyes. He hath others of fire, and of flame; a look wild, and furious: a viſage of an hundred colours, ſometimes red, blue, or violet, ſometimes pale and wan, according to the divers notions of his fury. His veins ſwell, the ſtorm within driving into them with violence, an huge quantity of blood, and ſpirits. His voice becomes rough, and loſeth its natural tone. His ſpeech is confus'd, and inarticulate, ruſhing forth all at once without order, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction. He biteth his lips, he grinds his teeth, and doth a thouſand other actions, ſo reſembling the actions of Demoniacks, as it is eaſie to ſee, that the paſſion which torments him, is a very <hi>demon.</hi> If you had ſeen your ſelves in this eſtate, I do not doubt, but you would have had horror at your ſelves; and hated the cauſe which ſo vilely disfigured you. But what need any other glaſs, to ſee the image of your anger in, than that which your neighbours paſſion doth daily preſent you with? That trouble, and that outragiouſneſs, and that frantick demeanour, which you cannot without ſhaking behold in them, is a faithful pourtraict of your choler. When it ſeizeth you, you are no whit more wiſe, nor leſs frightful, or unſufferable than they.</p>
                     <p>But as in nature, when the wind and the thunder have roar'd a while, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows hail, and ſire, breaking forth from the clouds, and making dreadful havock here below: ſo for the moſt part doth the tempeſt of anger paſs. After the noiſe and thunder of a thouſand reproaches, and indiſcreet, inſolent, ridiculous ſpeeches, in the end it uſually comes to blows, which are dealt this way, and that way, without judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or diſcretion. And when there happens to be reſiſtance: when one angry man encounters another poffeſs'd with the ſame rage, as not ſeldom 'tis: how ſad,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50919:180"/>and ſhameful is the combat of two ſuch furies, whom the <hi>demon,</hi> that guides them, makes to do, and ſuffer the vileſt and enormouſeſt things he can inſpire? Who can ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other evils which this execrable paſſion cauſeth in mankind? It troubleth the peace of families, and ſtates; ſtirring up ſeditions and wars in them. 'Tis it that hath invented duels; and to authorize its rage, makes it paſs for a point of honour: ſo blinding men, that they will have their honour to conſiſt in the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of GOD, and the damning of themſelves, by ſhedding anothers blood, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding their own; which undoubtedly is, not only the falſeſt, but the fooliſheſt, and ſenſeleſſeſt error that ever was. It's anger that plotteth, and executeth the moſt part of the treaſons, the murthers, and aſſaſſinates, which are committed in the world. 'Tis it that raiſeth clamors. Quarels and proceſſes are its workmanſhip. It breaks the moſt ſacred bonds of civil and domeſtick ſociety; and teacheth men ſhameleſly to tread under foot all laws, both divine, and humane. It inſtructs them to deſpiſe their own welfare, and repoſe, for having only the contentment of troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling other mens. There is no vice that carrieth men ſo far, nor that is apt to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more unnatural. Judge what, and how cruel its poiſon is, ſince <hi>David,</hi> who otherwiſe was a perſon ſo gentle, and benigne, by but taſting a little of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came chang'd in that manner, that he preſently made his men to march, with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to pillage, and maſſacre an whole poor innocent family, for only one man's fault. And you know the inhumanitie which this ſame paſſion caſt <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi> upon, cauſing them to put an whole City to fire and ſword, for one young man's indiſcretion,
<note place="margin">Gen. 49.5, 7.</note> and folly. Whence it comes, that <hi>Jacob</hi> their father, even on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, calleth them <hi>inſtruments of violence,</hi> and curſeth the impudence of their wrath, and the exceſſe of their fury. But as anger doth eaſily thruſt on men, and precipitate them into all ſorts of ſins: ſo is it on the other hand infinitely contrary to piety and ſanctity. It drives the Holy Ghoſt out of our ſouls, that is to ſay, the Author of all honeſty and vertue. For He dwells not in noiſe, and outragiouſneſs; And as the Scripture ſaith, in the hiſtorie of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s viſion, <hi>He is not in thoſe great impetuous winds,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 19.11.</note>

By conſequence, there is nothing that drives Him ſooner from within us, than the tumult of this bluſtering, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous paſſion. And indeed, inſtead of glorifying GOD, which is the firſt point of piety, wrath carrieth men to deſpite, and blaſpheme Him. It troubleth, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth all His ſervice; it being not poſſible that a ſoul ſhould pray unto Him, and invocate Him,
<note place="margin">Jam. 1.20.</note> as it ought, while it is in this agitation. And St. <hi>James</hi> advertiſeth us expreſly, that <hi>wrath fulfilleth not the righteouſneſs of GOD.</hi> It's an enemie to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; which deſireth the good, and the ſafety of its neighbour, whereas wrath wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and procureth his hurt and ruine. It extinguiſheth modeſty; it is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with patience, and humility; it expelleth conſolation, and joy. For what contentment or joy can there be, amid the tempeſts of this wretched paſſion? which diſquiets all things, and keeps our ſpirits in a continual agitation? It makes us trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and importune to every one; and inſtead of that ſweetneſs and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſhould adorn our manners, it planteth them with anxiouſneſs, and ill humour, roughneſs, and raſhneſs, and ſourneſs, as with ſo many briers, or nettles, which make all the world to ſhun our converſe, according to the wiſe man's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>Make no friendſhip with an angry man,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and with a furious man thou ſhalt not go.</hi> And whereas we ought to be aſſable, and acceſſible, and to attract ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to us by our ſweetneſs, and courteſie, and facility, for their edifying; anger, on the quite contrary, driveth away our very friends from us. For where is he, that by his good will, and without being by ſome neceſſity obliged, would live, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with a perſon ſubject to this paſſion? Accordingly you ſee, that whereas in other families, every one rejoyceth at the maſter's arrival; in the houſe of an angry man, on the contrary, nothing is ſo much dreaded, as his preſence; becauſe he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies brings diſturbance, and ſtorm with him, where ever he goes.</p>
                     <p>But if choler be troubleſome to others, it does no leſs incommodate him, whom it poſſeſſeth; keeping his ſpirit in an unquiet, and importune ardor; hindring all the ſweet, and contentful thoughts of his mind; and breeding others, that are black,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50919:180"/>and cruel, and tragical. It diſturbeth his repoſe, takes away his divertiſements, eats out his heart, like a viper. And it is not poſſible, but that with all this, it ſhould ruine, or at leaſt endamage the health of the body alſo; which conſiſting in a certain equality, and temperature of humours, and in the regular action, and well ordered moving of the blood, and ſpirits; what can be imagined more contrary to it, than this paſſion, which confoundeth, and over-turneth all this inward oeconomie of our bodies, turning, and toſſing our ſpirits, ſtirring, and driving our blood hither and thither, with extreme violence, and rapidity?</p>
                     <p>Beloved Brethren, Theſe are the characters, and principal effects of this paſſion. If reaſon, wherewith Heaven hath adorned your nature, be dear to you; if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Spirit of GOD, and His holy image, be of ſuch conſideration with you, as it ought; if you have any affection for the order, and welfare, and contentment of your neighbours; if you take pleaſure in their ſocietie; if you love the exerciſe of pietie, and other vertues; if you deſire to conſerve your ſouls in repoſe, and your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in health; obey the Apoſtle's command; pull up, and put away choler out of your hearts. Suffer not ſo dangerous a gueſt to lodge within you; the parent of quarels, and debates; the enemie of peace; the cauſe of hoſtilities, and murthers; the peſt of families, and eſtates; the ſtorm of the ſoul; the poiſon of the underſtanding; the blinding of reaſon; the abhorrence of GOD, and men; the ruine, and hell of thoſe whom it poſſeſſeth. Never tell me, that you cannot reſiſt the tyrannie of your cholerick temper; or that you did not begin firſt to be angry; but it was an injury from your neighbour, that kindled your wrath, and you ſhould paſs for a man of no ſpirit, if you ſuffered an affront without emotion, and reſentment. Theſe are but pretext, and vain excuſes, which cannot hide the ſhame of your fault. For, as for nature, it ſorceth no man to wrath. On the contrary, it loveth ſweetneſs, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility; and it would be a ſtrange thing, that we could not be men, without having the eagerneſs, and the tranſports of animals. If the Creator had given you choler; He hath alſo given you flegm to temper it, and reaſon to govern it, and the word, and Spirit of His Son, to mortifie it. And as for offences received from your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the producing of them is no juſtification of your paſſion: it's a telling us the ſtory, and occaſion of it. Why then, do you imagine, that the LORD never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids you to be angry, but then only, when no body gives you cauſe? If your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour doth well to be angry with you, why are you troubled at it? And if he does ill, why do you imitate him? His having begun, is ſo far from juſtifying you, that I doubt, this very thing will aggravate your crime. For he that caſts himſelf into an evil, into which he ſaw another fall, ſeems leſs excuſable than he. His example, wherein you might have ſeen the hideouſneſs of this paſſion, ſhould have kept you from it. And, as to the judgement of men; if they be wiſe, they will never impute it to you for faint-heartedneſs, that you have overcome your own animoſitie; ſince it's in this properly, that the higheſt point of magnanimitie conſiſteth; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear, that the weakeſt perſons of all, as children, and ſuch as reſemble them, are alſo ordinarily the moſt turbulent, and cholerick; and that true generoſitie is leſs ſubject to be moved, and perturbed. But if the opinion of the vicious, or ignorant, doth afright you, ſure you have not yet profited much in the School of CHRIST, where the firſt leſſon is, to deſpiſe the fantaſies, and maxims of the world, that we may reſt in the laws, and will of GOD.</p>
                     <p>Lay me then aſide all theſe nullities of excuſe, and ſedulouſlie form your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſweetneſs, and benignitie, which GOD requires. Shun all occaſions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and repell them when they occurr. And for the winning of this ground upon your ſelf, and the being alwaies maſter of your own ſpirits, deſcend into your ſelves, and conſider well the meanneſſe of your nature, and its little worth, that this body, which makes ſo much noiſe, is for ſubſtance, nothing but duſt and aſhes; that this breath, which animates it, is a ſpirit, 'tis true; but full of ignorance, and vanity; and, which is worſe, covered with crimes worthy of hell, if GOD ſhould judge you in rigour. Diſcharge your ſelves of that vain opinion of your nobilitie, of your riches, of your power, of your abilities, which puffs you up ſo much. For, to ſay true; all this is but a dream, and a non-entity. Such a conſideration would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent to keep down the ſtirring, and the boiling of your choler, which ariſeth moſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50919:181"/>times from nothing but our preſumption. For eſteeming our ſelves too highly, it ſeems to us, that no man can offend us, but it is high treaſon; and that a daring to attaque us, is ſome kind of impietie. But on the other hand, let us alſo judge of our neighbours, with more equitie, and reaſon; and think, that in the ſight of GOD, they are as much, or, it may be, more than we; they are the workmanſhip of His hand, the pourtraicts of His image, the redeemed of His CHRIST, and the deniſons of His Paradiſe, as well as we. If we look'd upon our ſelves, and them, in this manner, we ſhould not be ſo eaſily, or ſo vehemently troubled at the offences they do us. Then again, we ſhould lift up our eyes higher, and meditate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of GOD, and take all the outrages that are done us, as chaſtiſements, or trials, which beſide us by His order. It was this conſideration, that reſtrained <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s anger, on that juſt occaſion for it, which <hi>Shimci</hi>'s inſolency gave him. <hi>It is the LORD</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>who ſaid unto him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.10.</note> 
                        <hi>curſe</hi> David. A brave ſpeech! an holy declaration! If we conform unto it, all the occaſions of perturbation, which men give us, will be ſo many exerciſes for us of patience, and humility. If they revile us, we ſhall bleſs them. If they outrage us, we ſhall bear with them. If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn us, and abaſe us, we ſhall put our ſelves yet lower, and when they call us, worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs people, we ſhall add, yea, we are but dung, and ſilth. If they reproach us with poverty, or ignorance; we ſhall ſay in ſurpluſage, that we are but worms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and born in ſin. This would be a profiting by their outrages, and a making other mens furie, the ſubject of our vertue, and matter of our praiſe. It would be alſo of uſe, for the forming of us unto meckneſs, and patience, to have ſtill before our eyes, the patience, and meckneſs of a <hi>Moſes,</hi> of a <hi>David,</hi> of a <hi>Jeremy,</hi> of a St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and above all, of our LORD and Saviour; <hi>Who, when He was reviled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled not again,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pet. 2.23.</note> 
                        <hi>and when He ſuffered, threatned not;</hi> leaving us this glorious pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, that we might follow His ſteps. We ſhould too propoſe unto our ſelves the example of GOD Himſelf; Who is infinite goodneſs, and love; Who beareth His creatures blaſpheamings, and inſtead of cruſhing them, cauſeth His Sun to ſhine on them, and watereth their lands with His rain, inviting them ſo graciouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Which would you rather be? the diſciples of this ſupreameſt LORD, and of His Son, and of His Saints; or of thoſe miſerable vaſſals of ſin, whom the evil ſpirit doth poſſeſs? And this again ſhould ſweeten our reſentments toward thoſe that offend us, even the remembring, that it is Satan, who inſpires into them all the evil they ſay of us, or do to us. They are but his inſtruments. Mean time we faſten upon them, as if they were authors of the outrage; doing in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as dogs, who bite the ſtone that ſtruck them; and touch not the perſon that threw it. The man is worthy of our pity. The devil, that ſet him on work, does properly deſerve our hate. It's with this murtherer that we ſhould be angry. There it is, that paſſion would be juſt. But if by all theſe remedies, we cannot prevent, our being ſometimes incenſed againſt our neighbours, at leaſt let us ſtop when our perturbation boileth up.
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.26:</note> Let us not add ſin to our emotion, neither let <hi>the Sun</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>go down upon our wrath;</hi> but hold we for certain, that the ſhorteſt angers are the beſt.</p>
                     <p>Now if we can once deveſt our ſelves of this wretched paſſion, we ſhall by the ſame means eradicate together with it, that other of detraction, or evil ſpeaking, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here annexeth in the ſequel. For wrath is commonly the root from which the ſame doth ſpring, that at leaſt, which the Apoſtle means who uſeth a word that ſignifies a man's reviling of his neighbour: a thing ſcarce ever done, but in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. But all evil-ſpeaking, whatever origine it hath, is an accurſed, and a deadly plant; the production, and workmanſhip of the devil, the father of evil-ſpeakers. For his trade (you know) is to calumniate, to detract, and ſay evil. They, that do the ſame, are his diſciples, and it is from his ſuggeſtion, and infuſion, they derive the poiſon of their tongue. And as they have now part in his exerciſe; ſo ſhall they have one day in his torments; according to that which the Apoſtle teacheth us elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, namely, that <hi>revilers ſhall not inherit the kingdom of GOD.</hi> Indeed, ſince Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the inheritance of charity,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10.</note> and ſanctity: what portion in it can detraction pretend to, which is ſo contrary to thoſe two Vertues, and gives them at once three deadly wounds? goring, and outraging by the ſame blow, both the perſon of whom
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50919:181"/>it ſpeaketh evil; and the perſon to whom; and a man's own? It wounds the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the perſon of whom it ſpeaketh evil; and as much as in it lies, deprives him of his honour the greateſt of our external goods, and ſuch as no riches can equal the value of. It pollutes the ear of him that hears it, and makes ſuch a poiſon glide there-through into his heart, as is apt to extinguiſh neighbourly charity; and fill him with ſuſpitions, with averſion and hatred againſt his neighbour; even to the raiſing ſometimes of ſcandalous, and mortal enmities, and quarrels between them. In fine, the detractor doth not ſpare himſelf; but profaneth his own tongue, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, to the rending and ſcandalizing of his neighbour; whereas it was given him by his Creator, to be an inſtrument of benediction, and edification. And this ſeems to be properly the conſideration which the Apoſtle here had in his eye. <hi>Having clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our hearts from the ordures of wrath, and malignity, he alſo purifieth our mouths,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5.3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of them what is contrary to their ſanctification. Put away</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wrath, anger, maliciouſneſs, evil ſpeaking, diſhoneſt words out of your mouth.</hi> And this is the reaſon, why unto detraction, he addeth diſhoneſt ſpeech; becauſe it defiles our mouths, and corrupteth ſpeech, one of the moſt precious preſents that Divine bounty hath made us; and made, that our mind might uſe it for the communicating of its good and holy conceptions unto others, for their conſolation, and edification. Whereas quite contrary, he that makes unhoneſt diſcourſes to them, fills their ears with dung, and fouls the purity of their hearts, and ſhews the infection of his own: <hi>out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of which his mouth ſpeaks,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith. For, as an ill breath doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſome inward indiſpoſition, and corruption; ſo filthy, and diſhoneſt talk, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers impurity, and unchaſtity in his ſoul who makes it. Hence it is, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in another place, expreſly puts this among other parts of Chriſtian ſanctity, that our diſcourſes be pure, and chaſt, and honeſt; <hi>Fornication, and all uncleanneſs, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, let it not be once named among you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as becometh Saints. Neither fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, nor fooliſh talking, nor jeſting, which are not convenient.</hi> And again elſe-where, <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth; but that which is good to the uſe of edifying, that it may miniſter grace unto the hearers.</hi> Behold, Beloved Brethren, the divine doctrine of this great Apoſtle. Conform we our whole life unto the ſame, ſerving GOD in body and Spirit; and ſanctifying our hearts and mouths unto His glory, and the edification of our neighbours; eradicating firſt out of our ſouls, all aſperity and bitterneſs, anger, wrath, and malignity, and planting them with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſweetneſs, and patience towards all men; then purging our tongues alſo from the poiſons of detraction, and from the filth of all diſhoneſt ſpeech, conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them as precious veſſels to the praiſe of GOD, and the ſpiritual utility of men; to the end there be nothing in our carriage, but what is worthy of the diſcipline of our LORD JESUS CHRIST; and that after we ſhall have ſo walked in His fear, in all piety, and honeſty, He may one day receive us into His Kingdom of glory, where, without holineſs, none ſhall enter. Unto Him, with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, be all honour, and praiſe, to ages of ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the advantages, which raiſe our nature above that of animals, ſpeech doth undoubtedly hold one of the firſt ranks; being, as it is, the interpreter of the mind, the image of thought, the inſtrument of communication, the bond of ſociety, the inſtruction of ignorance, the conſolation of grief, the parent, and nurſe of friendſhip, and the ſweetneſs of life. If you conſider it in its ſelf, what can be imagin'd more marvellous than this faculty, which doth repreſent, by a certain number of ſounds, not very different from one another, the infinite variety of all thoſe things that come into our minds? and bringing them out of that inacceſſible, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable receſs, where our ſoul conceives, and forms them within its ſelf, makes them appear abroad, rendring that in ſome ſort viſible, which was altogether inviſible; and that corporeal, which was purely ſpiritual? I well know, that animals do diſcover the paſſions, and movings of their ſouls; joy, grief, fear, deſire, by certain cries, which they utter as often as they are ſurprized with the ſame. But there is nothing in this that comes near ſpeech. For the voices of animals do proceed from nature it ſelf; whereas words of ſpeech are an effect, and an inſtitution of reaſon. Thoſe are confuſed, and inarticulate; theſe diſtinct, and formed with excellent art. Thoſe expreſs nothing but the paſſions of a ſenſitive faculty; theſe do repreſent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the underſtanding. But the utility of ſpeech is no leſs than the wonder. Without it, aſſemblies of men would be but ſo many herds of cattle, and their reaſon do them little more ſervice, than if they had none at all. Whereas now ſpeech brings it forth, and renders it uſeful to us, communicating unto many, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely multiplying what was at firſt but in one ſoul alone. For as a ſeal imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the form that's cut on it, upon all the drops of wax to which you apply it: ſo Speech gliding, through the ear, into the hearts of all that hear it, engraveth on them that image which it carries with it, of the mind and will of the ſpeaker. It guideth,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50919:182"/>and keeps up the negotiations, the treaties, the alliances, the arts, the ſciences, and the diſciplines of men; and is the ſoul of their commerce, and of their converſation, and in a word, of all their humanity. 'Tis by it that ſuperiors make themſelves to be obeyed, and inferiors obtain the aſſiſtances they need; ſince 'tis it, that makes both the wills of the one, and the neceſſities of the other, to be underſtood. 'Tis it that unites the ſouls of equals, and diſcovers to the one, and the other, what each hath of reaſon, and wiſdom in himſelf, or of ſympathie, and averſion for others. It tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the ſouls of the one into the others, pouring into them their ſentiments, their reaſonings, their inventions, and their affections.</p>
                     <p>But as the abuſe of the excellenteſt things, is much more dangerous than that of things mean, and common; ſo it is plain, that the efficacy of ſpeech is not leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, when applied to evil; than uſeful, and beneficial, when employ'd to good. It is as powerful to deſtroy, as to edifie; to infect, as to cure; and is equally capable of communicating unto men health, and ſickneſs, life, and death, as the ſprings and intentions be, from which it is diſpenſed. Speech being of ſo great importance in the life of men, it's with great reſon, that the Apoſtle hath taken care, in the rule he here gives us for our deportment, to cleanſe it of the vices which ſin hath ſowl'd it with. You may remember, that in the precedent text, he purged it of the poiſons of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and of pollutions contrary to honeſty, commanding us to put away evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking, and diſhoneſt talk, out of our mouth. Now, to the end it may be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure, and legitimate, and truly worthy of a Chriſtian mouth, he taketh out of it, lying alſo, the moſt ſhameful of its defilements, and that which is moſt directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its natural conſtitution. <hi>Lie not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one to another.</hi> And becauſe, in the precedent action, ſhortneſs of time permitted us not, to ſay all that we deſired, upon the two former vices of ſpeech, we will reſume that diſcourſe now, with your permiſſion; and treat, if the Lord pleaſe, of all thoſe three ſins of the tongue, which the holy Apoſtle hath here forbidden us; firſt, evil-ſpeaking; then in the ſecond place, filthineſs contrary to honeſty; and thirdly, lying. May it pleaſe GOD to guide us in this diſcourſe, and ſo purifie our lips with the Divine fire of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly coal, wherewith He ſometime touched thoſe of a Prophet of His, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth our mouths may be ſo many living ſources of benediction, and edification, from whence ſhall iſſue none but good, and innocent, pure, and honeſt, ſincere, and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpeeches, unto His glory, and our neighbours benefit, and our own ſalvation; <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle, in the original of this text, makes uſe of the word, blaſphemy, to ſignifie that which we have rendred evil-ſpeaking. For though that term, in our vulgar tongue, doth import words ſpoken to the offence of GOD, when things unworthy of His greatneſs, and His holineſs, and truth, are attributed unto Him, or thoſe that belong unto Him, are denied of Him; or when that which is proper to His Divinity, is communicated to creatures; yet ſo it is, that in Greek, that is, in the language the Apoſtle ſpeaks, the word, blaſphemy, doth generally ſignifie any offenſive, injurious ſpeech, whomſoever it concerns, whether GOD, or Angels, or men. The truth is, this word, if we reſpect its origination, or etymologie, doth ſimply denote, an hurting of the reputation, an offending of ſome one's honour; as the Greek Grammarians have obſerved. Whence it comes, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth it, not here only, but alſo elſe-where, to ſignifie ſuch revilings, and detractions, as are directed properly unto men, and not unto GOD; as when he ſaith, in the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Corinthians; We are blamed, and do intreat;</hi> it is in the original,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.13.</note> 
                        <hi>we are blaſphemed:</hi> And when he enjoyns <hi>Titus,</hi> to admoniſh the faithful, that <hi>they ſpeak evil of no man:</hi> It is word for word in the Greek, that <hi>they blaſpheme no man.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tit. 3.2.</note> That evil ſpeaking, which he doth in this place ſo ſeverely baniſh from all Chriſtians mouths, is a vice ſo common, that no one can be ignorant of it. The world is full of it, and the Church it ſelf beholds but too many examples of it, in thoſe that make profeſſion of her communion. But that no man may deceive himſelf, it will not be impertinent to repreſent the principal kinds of it. For as the peſtilence is not all of a ſort, but great diverſity is found in the poiſons it comprehends, and in the manner after which they ſeize on humane bodies; ſo is it with evil-ſpeaking. It's a poiſon, that hath under it many different ſpecies; a miſchief that puts forth divers branches
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50919:183"/>from one and the ſame root of bitterneſs. If you regard the form of it; one ſmites uncovered, another deals its blows in ſecret: the former revileth openly, and rends the honour of a neighbour in his preſence; the latter manageth its ſelf ſubtilly, and blackens his reputation in private, with ſo much the more effect; for that it is in a place, where no perſon appears to ward off its blows. If you conſider the cauſes, and occaſions of the thing; ſome are puſh'd on to it by choler, others by hatred; ſome by a cloſe envy, the moſt by a ſecret malignity of nature. In fine, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their deſign; ſome do it to avenge themſelves of offences, which they believe they have receiv'd; others to ſatisfie their naughty humour; and a third ſort, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to paſs away the time. It may well be, that the Apoſtle here did particularly aim at open evil-ſpeaking, which being preſſed by the violence of anger, breaks out into revilings; ſince it is of this paſſion expreſly, that He ſpake in the precedent words. Yet we may not imagin, that he permitteth us any one of the kinds of this evil. For what difference ſoever there be in other reſpects, this is common to them all, that they offend our neighbour, and deprive him, either in whole, or in part, of the preciouſeſt of his goods, that is, his reputation. If it be then a mortal ſin to rob a man of his money, or his movables, or his lands; how much more grievous is his crime, who attempts to bereave him of his honour, which is more to be eſteemed than life it ſelf? To which muſt be added, that goods may be recovered, and are actually recovered very often. But it is extremely difficult, and ordinarily impoſſible for perſons, whoſe reputation evil ſpeaking hath violated, to repair the loſs. And though the wound, which an evil-ſpeaker hath given, be cured, yet it is ſcarce ever ſo well and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, but there remains a skar ſtill.</p>
                     <p>But beſides reputation, which evil-ſpeaking doth properly attake, it moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly takes away ſome of thoſe other goods that depend upon it; yea, ſometimes life its ſelf. For, both the affection of our friends, and the edification we afford our neighbours, being conſequents of the eſteem they have for us; who ſees not, that the blows of a ſlanderous tongue do deprive us of the one and the other of theſe good things, in ruining that good opinion which was had of us? And if the perſon that takes in the poiſons of evil-ſpeaking, be potent, and in ſome high authority; how unſpeakable are the miſeries, and mournful effects which it produceth? It was this accurſed operatrix, that e're-while ruined <hi>David</hi> with King <hi>Saul,</hi> and drew upon him a long, and a cruel perſecution. 'Tis it, that in the Courts of Princes, and in the families of private men, doth daily cauſe a thouſand and a thouſand diſorders; that diſſolveth the beſt friendſhips; that ſoweth diſtruſts; that enkindleth hatreds; that embroileth quarrels; that oppreſſeth the innocent; that renders the faireſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues hideous, and the greateſt abilities ſuſpected, often depriving Church and ſtate of the exquiſite fruits that might be reap'd from their being employed. And the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> to repreſent this pernicious efficacy of evil-ſpeaking, tells us, that <hi>its detractions are ſharp arrows ſhot by a ſtrong man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 120.</note> 
                        <hi>and coals of Juniper;</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſon, in like manner, compares the calumniator, to an hammer, to a ſword, and a ſharp ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; both the one and the other, meaning, that there is in nature neither metal nor fire, nor weapon more dangerous than the tongue of a ſlanderer. 'Tis of it we muſt properly underſtand what the Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith of the tongue in general, namely,
<note place="margin">Jam. 3.6, 7.</note> that <hi>it is a fire, yea, a world of iniquity, which defileth the whole body, and ſets on fire the courſe of nature, and is ſet on fire of hell: that it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poiſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſetting aſide the horrible effects which evil-ſpeaking produceth in all ſocieties of men, its malignity and unrighteouſneſs appear of themſelves. For whereas the LORD obligeth us, to conſider the good qualities and perfections wherewith He hath endowed His creatures, to the end we might praiſe and eſteem them, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them, to His glory, and our own edification; the Evil-ſpeaker looks upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their defects and vices. And as vultures flye over fair meadows, and flowry and ſweet-ſmelling fields, and alight only on dunghills, and places full of carrion, and infection; and as flies, without touching at the ſound parts of the body, do fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten only upon ſores, and ulcers; ſo the Evil-ſpeaker, without ſo much as noting what is graceful and happy in the lives of men, falls upon that which is weak and ſickly in them. If they have chanced to ſtumble (as is very ordinary in this infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50919:183"/>of our nature) thereon it is that he fixeth; therein he takes pleaſure, this he glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovers, and publiſheth, amplifying and exaggerating it with his infernal rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. It's by that he knoweth perſons; it's by that he marks them out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes them; as bad Painters, that repreſents nothing ſo exactly, as the moles and skars of the faces they draw, the deformity of the noſe, the bigneſs of the lips, and other like marks which they have from the birth, or by ſome accident. Charity co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth ſins, and forgetteth them. The evil-ſpeaker divulgeth them, and remembreth them perpetually, and takes out of the grave what had been buried in oblivion, and brings it to light again. He loveth ordures, and feeds on nothing but poiſons, and immundicities. And for this end, he hath alwaies a ſufficient ſtore of ſuch proviſion by him. His memory is a magazin, or rather a ſink, where he heaps up the vilinies, the ſins, and the ſcandals, not of his own neighbourhood, or his own quarter only, but of the whole City; yea, of the whole ſtate, if poſſibly he may. It is from this diabolical treaſury, that he fetcheth the ſubject of his ſweeteſt thoughts, and moſt pleaſing entertainments. Theſe things are his perfumes, and his dainties. But yet he is not content to rake together, and lay open the ill he finds in his neighbours. He is ſo malignant, that he feigneth more, and fancyeth ſome where there is none. He ſpreadeth it abroad for true, and that he may perſwade others of it, he artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally coloureth his fictions, giving out ſhews for truths, and ſhadows for ſubſtances. He ſo bitterly hateth all good that where he ſeeth any he beſpatters it, and denigrates it, and diſguiſeth it, and makes it paſs for evil. And, as the ſnail fowleth the luſtre of the faireſt flowers with its ſordid ſlime: juſt ſo this bad man, by the poiſons of his malignity, defameth the moſt grateful vertues, and makes vices of them. He takes valour for a temerity, and patience for a ſtupidity; juſtice for cruelty, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>

                        </gap>ſs. Him that is liberal, he calls prodigal; and the frugal perſon, covetous. If you be religious, he will not fail to blame you of ſuperſtition; And if you be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ree, and generous, and far from ſuperſtition, he will accuſe you of being profane. In fine, there is no vertue, nor perfection, but this naughty man hath found an infamous name for, taken from the vice that borders next upon it. Unto this iniquity he uſually addeth a baſe, and black piece of treachery, when to make his poiſons be the more eaſily ſwallowed, he miſchievouſly ſugars them, beginning his detractions with a preface of praiſe, and with an affected commendation of the perſons whom he hath a mind to revile; proteſting at his entrance, that he loveth, and reſpecteth them; to the end he may create a belief, that it is nothing but the meer force, and evidence of truth, that conſtrains him to ſpeak evil of them. He kiſſeth his man at meeting, and then murthers him, as <hi>Joab</hi> ſometime did: he crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his victims, before he killeth them. A fraud, that for all its being ordinary, is nevertheleſs the blackeſt, and the moſt malignant that can be.</p>
                     <p>After theſe things, we need not wonder, that GOD and his Saints have abhorred Evil-ſpeaking, and univerſally treated it, as one of the moſt deteſtable vices in the world. As for our LORD, He forbad it expreſly to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, in thoſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not go up and down detracting among thy people.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lev. 19.16. Exod. 23.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt not raiſe a falſe report.</hi> And for Saints, <hi>David</hi> proteſteth, <hi>he will cut off the man that ſlandereth his neighbour privily;</hi> and among the qualities he gives the perſons that ſhall dwell in GOD's holy hill, he ſaith particularly, that <hi>ſuch a one backbites not with his tongue,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 15.3.</note> 
                        <hi>nor raiſeth up an ill report againſt his neighbour.</hi> He curſeth this kind of people, and maketh ſuch vehement imprecations againſt them, in the 109 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as we do not find he ever uſed the like againſt any ſort of ſinners. And truly, with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For indeed, there is no vice more malignant, or upon which the Devil's marks are more expreſs. Proſit ſeduceth the thief; pleaſure precipitateth the fornicator, and adulterer: the honour of the world makes the murtherer commit his ſin. The evil-ſpeaker can alledge no ſuch thing; it being evident, that he reaps from his vice no fruit at all. There redounds thence to him, neither honour, nor profit, nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>What will it give thee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 120.3.</note> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt to him) <hi>and wherein will that tongue advance thee, which is but deceit?</hi> as if he had ſaid, that he could draw no advantage from it, and that by wounding, and wronging others, he got nothing for himſelf. It's a meer ſin, a thing that hath no allurement, or temptingneſs to excuſe it; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording him that commits it, nothing but the pleaſure of the Devil, who loveth evil
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50919:184"/>for its own ſake, and ſeeks no other ſatisfaction in ſin, but the having committed it. Accordingly you ſee, that detraction, and calumny, is the proper exerciſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. At the beginning, he ſlandered GOD unto man, inducing him to beleeve falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that GOD envied his perfection. He ſlandereth men unto GOD, miſchievouſly accuſing in His preſence, the ſervice they do him, of hypocriſie, and impiety, as you ſee in the hiſtory of <hi>Job:</hi> It's for this he compaſſeth the earth, and traceth inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too and fro. He takes all this pain, only to find food for his evil-ſpeaking, and have matter of calumniation. And it's by this character, St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribeth him in the Apocalyps, where he calleth him, <hi>the accuſer of our brethren, that accuſeth them night and day before our GOD.</hi> There are then no ſinners that do more reſemble this unclean and accurſed ſpirit, than Evil-ſpeakers. Their vice, and the pleaſure they take in it, is the true and genuine image of Satan. Certainly the Apoſtle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted this ſin ſo horrible, and ſo contrary to the legitimate and natural conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, that he expreſly puts detraction, and evil-ſpeaking, among the fruits of that reprobate ſenſe,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.30.</note> to which the Gentiles were delivered up, becauſe of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. And elſe where he would have us to hold evil-ſpeakers for anathematized, and excommunicate perſons, with whom we ſhould have no commerce; but drive them even from our tables, as infamous harpyes, that would polute our repaſts. <hi>I write to you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that if any one,</hi>

                        <hi>who is called a brother, be an evil-ſpeaker, you keep no company with him, and not ſo much as eat with ſuch a one.</hi> And as he baniſheth them from our communion in this world,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10.</note> ſo doth he expreſly enroll them among thoſe, who <hi>ſhall have no part in the kingdom of GOD, in the world to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Flee then, Beloved Brethren, flee this mortal peſt. Let not the bad examples, and vain opinions of the world, which eſteemeth and careſſeth it, deceive you. It is not by the examples, nor maxims of this generation, that a Chriſtian ought to ſhape his converſation. What diſguiſement ſoever be but upon it, the intrinſick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this vice cannot be changed. The good companies it is found in, the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is given it, the colours it is farded with, do not hinder, but that after all, this Evil-ſpeaking is blaſted, and accurſed by our LORD, deteſted and interdicted by His holy Miniſters; the image, and character of Satan; the daughter of envy, or hatred, or anger, or malignity; the mother of ſcandals; the incentive of diſcords, the ſcourge of all humane ſocieties, and at laſt an infallible inheretrix of hell. Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not your ſelves, ye evil-ſpeakers. Acknowledge the horridneſſe of your vice, and renounce it betimes; and know, that otherwiſe you can have no part either in the grace or glory of CHRIST JESUS. Do not tell me that you ſay nothing but what is true. I doubt it much; it being difficult, that an evil-ſpeaking perſon ſhould tell any ſtory of his neighbours, and not add ſomething of his own. Yet ſuppoſe it be ſo, and that the perſons you rip up, are in truth guilty of all the turpitude you impute to them. You hugely deceive your ſelves, if you think to be exempted from evil-ſpeaking thereby.
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 22. Mar. 14.58.</note> 
                        <hi>Doeg</hi> reported to <hi>Saul,</hi> that he ſaw <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the Prieſt. And the Jews teſtified, that the LORD JESUS had ſaid, <hi>He would raiſe the Temple again in three daies.</hi> The one, and the other was true; and yet the Scripture condemneth both <hi>Doeg,</hi> and thoſe Jews, as very calumniators, and falſe witneſſes; and that juſtly; for that their deſign, in ſaying ſuch things, was to offend the reputation of thoſe they ſpake of, and to hurt them. And in general, whoever ſaith evil of his neighbour, is guilty of evil-ſpeaking, though what he ſaith of him be true, if he ſay it without neceſſity, in place, at times, unto perſons, where there is no need he ſhould ſay it. To have diſcovered a fault, is an evil; ſeeing fear of ſcandal obligeth us to hide it, and to wound, by ſo doing, the reputation of the faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is yet a further evil; it being evident, that except his ſalvation, or publick edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation do compell us, we ought not to awaken up, nor ſtir ſuch things. Neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain excuſe you your ſelves, by ſaying, that it is not a deſign to harm your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nor any hatred you bear him, that moves you to ſpeak amiſs of him; but what you ſay, is only to paſs the time, for want of better diſcourſe. Wretched man, how would you deal with him, if you hated him, ſince having not, as you ſay, any ill will for him, you forbear not to rend him in this manner? Your ſoul muſt needs be infinitely maligne, ſince it makes a paſtime of offending a perſon, whom you hate not. As if a man, and he too a Chriſtian, had not matter enough to employ his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50919:184"/>tongue, in celebrating the wonders of GOD, and perfections of his creatures; and as if it were not much a greater pleaſure to ſpeak of good than of evil. Renounce then henceforth this unworthy and infamous exerciſe, and leave it to Devils, to whom it doth belong, and to thoſe baſer and more impure ſpirits, which relemble them. Put away all evil ſpeaking out of your mouth, and conſecrate your tongues to the bleſſing of GOD, and the edifying of men. Remember that excellent rule, which the LORD hath given us; <hi>All the things ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye alſo unto them.</hi> There is not a perſon of you, but holds it for a grievous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to be ſlandred and ill ſpoken of; take heed then of treating others in that manner; cover their defects, if they have any; hide their faults, if they have chanced to commit any: conſidering that you are not exempted neither, and have need of the charity you exerciſe towards them. Buſie your ſelves in curing your own evils, rather than in diſcovering other mens; and be more ſolicitous to correct your own defaults, than curious to learn or publiſh theirs. Seek your contentment in your own good deeds, and not in the evils of others. But as it is not ſufficient a man doth not ſteal, he muſt not conceal anothers theft neither: So it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, my Brethren, that we forbear evil ſpeaking our ſelves; we muſt not ſo much as entertain the evil ſpeakings of others; keep we our ears as well as our mouths, pure and free from this poyſon; defend we the abſent, when they are ill ſpoken of in our preſence; favour their honour, and if we cannot otherwiſe do it, at leaſt declare we by our looks and countenance, how troubleſom detractive diſcourſes are unto us. This is often ſufficient to ſilence them: For the Vice is ſo weak, and ſo ſhameful in its ſelf, that to beat it down, we need but put it back. And this is the Wiſe man's meaning, when he ſaith, <hi>That as the Northwind driveth away rain,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pro. 25.23.</note> 
                        <hi>ſo doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But having ſpoken of Detraction, it is time to come to the other Vice, of which the Apoſtle here would purge our mouths. <hi>Put away</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>diſhoneſt talk out of your mouths.</hi> This is ſo ſhameful a filthineſs, that it hath no place in the manners of the people of the World, who have ever ſo little honeſty and gravity. And I cannot enough wonder at the extravagancy of the antient <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophers, who maintaining vertue and honeſty as to other things, did nevertheleſs permit their wiſe man to utter the moſt unſeemly matters, ſhameleſly and without any cover at all. It is certain, that this licentiouſneſs of the tongue cannot come but from the uncleanneſs of the heart; a ſoul chaſt and truly holy, having all images of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in abhorrence. And as this impurity of ſpeech ariſeth from corruption, ſo it evidently tends thereto, infecting the minds and affections of them that hear it. And to this, that Greek Proverb, which the Apoſtle elſewhere mentions, muſt be particularly referred, That <hi>evil words corrupt good manners.</hi>

                           </gap>.</note> For ſuch diſcourſes bring into our ſpirit filthy and abominable images, which being receiv'd, do make impreſſion, and growing familiar with us, do by little and little take away the ſhame and horror we ought to have at diſhoneſt things. I ſay as much of the unclean and perverſe artifice of thoſe who hide the impurity of their thoughts under covered ſpeeches, and of a double meaning. For it's theſe ſayings that ſink deepeſt into the imagination, and do ſo much the more harm, in that they are cloſer and more wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And here I cannot forbear complaining of their abuſe alſo, who have admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred auricular confeſſion as they call it, among Chriſtians, ſince it hath been in uſe. For theſe men, under pretext of informing themſelves of the ſtate of the ſouls of thoſe whom they confeſs, do often make ſtrange queſtions to them, and ſuch as ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with modeſty: Wherein they commit two faults; the one is, that contrary to the Apoſtles expreſs prohibition, both here and elſewhere, they licence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſay and hear diſhoneſt things, changing the tongue of Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST, which ſhould be nothing but ſanctity and honeſty, into a veſſel of dung; and their ear into a publick ſink of all the filth of a Pariſh. The other is, that by ſuch demands they open peoples hearts to Vice, and moſt dangerouſly put them in mind of evils, which they perhaps would never have thought on: They are come ſo far in this matter, that not content with corners, and the ſecret of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſionals, they have alſo publiſhed great Books upon this Subject, which the moſt ſhameleſs would be hardly able to read without bluſhing. Such among others, is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50919:185"/>that one of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuit,
<note place="margin">P. Aurelius.</note> in which he hath heap'd together ſo many ordures, yea ſome until now unheard of in the world; that other Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion have been forced to make publick declaration of the indignation and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror that this infamous Volume hath cauſed in them; though other-ways, both the writing and the Author be infinitely eſteemed by thoſe of his own order. As for us, my Brethren, who are not in truth the companions (as theſe Gentlemen qualifie themſelves) but the ſervants and Diſciples of the LORD JESUS, let us form our mouths by the example of his moſt holy One, and by the rules of his Apoſtle. Let there be nothing in our language, but what is honeſt, and grave, and ſeaſoned with the ſalt of grace; worthy of the ear, not only of chaſteſt Virgins, but of Angels themſelves: For likewiſe it's for this uſe, that the LORD hath given us a tongue, not to pollute the ears of our neighbours, not to teach them evils they knew not, or oblige them to diſcover to us what they know; but indeed to edifie them, to glorifie the name of GOD, to ſhew forth his wonders, and ſpeak that language in this world, which we ſhall eternally ſpeak in that holy and glorious <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on high, into which no impurity nor filthineſs ſhall enter.</p>
                     <p>There remains the third Vice, of which the Apoſtle would purge our ſpeech, that is <hi>Lying;</hi> a Vice that hath greateſt extent of all the reſt, and ſuch as men ſlip into with moſt facility: <hi>Lye not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one to another.</hi> Truth is properly a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and conformity of our conceptions, with their object; when the image we form of it in our minds, is ſuch as the thing it ſelf, to which it hath relation; as when we believe that a thing is or is not, which accordingly is or is not indeed. But truth of ſpeech, to which Lying is oppoſed, is meaſured by our conception, and not by the thing which is the object of it; that is, our ſpeaking is true, when it accords not with the thing it ſelf immediately, but with the conception we have of it. Whence it happens not ſeldom, that a man ſpeaks a thing which is falſe, yet doth not lye; and on the contrary, ſometimes lyeth, though what he ſpeaks be in it ſelf true; as when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, that his ſon <hi>Joſeph</hi> was dead, he lyed not, becauſe his tongue, in what it uttered, accorded with his heart, though the thing ſpoken were not true; and on the contrary, if he had ſaid, againſt the belief of his ſoul, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had been alive, he had lyed, ſince he had ſpoken contrary to his own thought; though what he had ſaid in that caſe, would have been in it ſelf true. Man, being a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature, is bound to endeavour, that he may have no opinion or ſentiment in any thing, but what is veritable, and conform to the being of the thing; heedfully keeping himſelf from being ſurprized, and from falling into any error: yet this is not properly the duty which the Apoſtle requireth of us here. As indeed we muſt acknowledge, that through the weakneſs of our apprehenſions and underſtanding, and amid that infinity of falſe appearances, which things or men continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us with, it would be very difficult, not to ſay impoſſible, to preſerve our ſelves from all error, and never be deceiv'd in common life. The Apoſtle demands of us a very eaſie and juſt thing, even that we never ſpeak any thing but what we believe to be true; and that in the commerce we have with men, our language be ſincere and faithful, without fraud and without fallacy, naturally repreſenting without, what we conceive within; and that it never betide us, to ſay one thing, and think the contrary. The Scripture teacheth us in a multitude of places, that GOD hateth ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than any other Vice;
<note place="margin">Prov. 12.22.</note> and the Wiſe man ſaith expreſly, That falſe lips are an abomination to him; the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> alſo, among other marks he gives the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Hill of GOD,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.2.</note> puts this for the very firſt, That they walk uprightly, and work righteouſneſs, and ſpeak the truth, as it is in their heart; and elſewhere he ſpeaketh peremptorily,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 5.7.</note> That GOD will deſtroy them that ſpeak leaſing. In ſum, S.
<note place="margin">Rev. 21.8.</note> 
                        <hi>John</hi> proclaimeth in his Revelation, That the portion of all lyers ſhall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone. Whence you ſee, that queſtion here is not of a matter of decency, but of a neceſſary duty, which we may not fail of, without incurring perdition. The juſtice of it is ſo evident, that the Sages of the Pagans themſelves have acknowledg'd it; leaving us in their Books, a thouſand notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of that roundneſs, and ſimplicity, and truth, which a man of honour and probity ſhould inviolably obſerve in his whole life: For ſpeech having been given us by nature, or to ſay better, by the God of nature, to the end we might ſignifie and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50919:185"/>declare unto our neighbours, what we have in our hearts; it's clear, that an abuſing it, to ſignifie what we do not think, is a violation of the Law, and inſtitution of Nature. And all true and generous courages, have this ſentiment ſo imprinted on their ſouls, that they cannot endure double perſons; whence it comes, that the Prince of Heathen Poets makes his Heroe ſay, He hates no leſs than the gates of Hell, the man that ſays one thing, and hides in his heart another. Lying is a ſlaviſh Vice, that proceeds either from baſeneſs of ſpirit, or from badneſs of conſcience, or from vanity. Accordingly you ſee, that it's extreamly odious among all noble and civilized Nations; and particularly in ours of the <hi>French,</hi> where you know there is no outrage that's accounted more grievous, and more ſenſible, than to charge a man with lying. He that hath ſuffer'd it without juſtifying himſelf, is held to be a man loſt in honour, not among Gentlemen only, but even among people of meaner birth; this generous and veritable ſentiment having been left us from hand to hand by our Anceſtors, that lying is an infamous thing, and the mark of a ſoul either wicked or witleſs; and that he, who is not aſham'd of it, will make conſcience of nothing; as on the contrary, truth is the foundation of all vertue and honeſty. But the Scripture ſheweth us in two clauſes, what we ſhould think of it; when on one hand it nameth the Devil, the Father of lyes, and on the other, calls the LORD the GOD of truth, and his eternal Son, the truth it ſelf. A conſideration that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the temerity of thoſe ſo much the more unſufferable, who ſtiling themſelves the companions of JESUS, have not ſhamed to favour lying, by that Doctrine of Equivocations, and mental reſervations, as they call them,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.20.</note> which they have publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and practiſed in theſe laſt times. <hi>But ye have not ſo learned CHRIST, if ſo be ye have heard and been taught by him, as the truth is in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> He hates all lying and obliquity, in what manner ſoever they be diſguiſed; and would not have his truth diſhonoured by begging from its enemies hand, the help it needeth; that is, he would no ways have fraud and fallacy employ'd on his behalf; his providence is potent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to defend it, without ſuch infamous ſuccour. It's a maxim of his Apoſtles, that we muſt not do evil, that good may come thereof. Lying is an evil, contrary to the Law of God, and the Ordinances of nature. There cannot therefore be any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that gives us a diſpenſation to commit it.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee, beloved Brethren, that which we had to ſay unto you, concerning theſe three Vices, which the Apoſtle does here baniſh from the mouths of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Evil-ſpeaking, Impurity and Lying. Let us obey his holy Doctrine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that according to S. <hi>James; He that offendeth not in word, the ſame is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man;</hi> let us diligently purge ours from all theſe ordures, and ſo govern our tongue, that it may not ſpeak, but of wiſdom, nor pronounce, but of judgment; and that all our diſcourſes may be full of goodneſs, and of honeſty, and of truth, ſo as our LORD and Saviour, who is charity, purity and ſoveraign truth, may own us for his, and after the combats and tryals of this life, give us part one day in the peace and triumphs of the next; receiving us into the ſociety of thoſe pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirits, who live on high in the Heavens with him, to bleſs him for ever; as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, with the Father and the holy Spirit, the only true GOD, belongeth all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; I know, and freely confeſs, that being called this day, through the goodneſs of GOD, to celebrate the memory of the death and paſſion of our LORD JESUS CHRIST; this ſacred chair is obliged, for the fitting you to ſo important an action, to entertain you with things that relate to this great and divine myſterie. But as I acknowledge, that this is properly the ſervice in which I ſhould employ this hour; ſo I conceive, that theſe words of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which you have heard, and which occur in the chain of our ordinary Text, are very ſutable to that principal ſubject of our exhortation. For this putting off of the old man, and this putting on of the new, of which they tell us, are both the one, and the other, the true effect of this death of our LORD, the remembrance whereof we ſolemnize. If JESUS had not dyed, we ſhould never have put off the old man, nor put on the new; ſince that without His death, we could not have had the pardon of our ſins, nor the grace of the Holy Spirit, nor the hope of immortality; all which are things abſolutely neceſſary to the deveſting us of the old man, and to the reveſting us with the new. Whereas now JESUS CHRIST dying on the Croſs, hath there pierced through, and faſtned up our old man; and by the vertue of His ſufferings, created and formed in us another new man, as different from the old, as Heaven from the Earth, and Life from Death. Therefore the Apoſtle doth elſewhere conclude, from the death of JESUS CHRIST, the death of the old man in us, and the life of the new.
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.15.17.</note> 
                        <hi>If one died for all,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>then are all dead, and He died for them, that they might live henceforth in Him, and no more unto themſelves. If any man be in CHRIST,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50919:186"/>he is a new creature.</hi> And in another place he ſaith expreſly,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6, 11.</note> that <hi>our old man was crucified with CHRIST, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, and that we being dead with Him, might live to GOD in Him.</hi> Thus the death of CHRIST is at once, the deſtruction of the old man, and the production of the new; the one was aboliſh'd by it, and the other created. This fleſh of the myſtical Lamb, which GOD to day preſents us, hath ſlain our fleſh, and enlivened our ſpirit; and from that Divine blood of His, wherein the old man is drown'd, is iſſu'd forth the new, created in righteouſneſs, and holineſs: like as heretofore, the Iſraelite was ſeen to come, alive, and glorious, out of that very gulf of the Red-ſea, wherein the Egyptian lay ſunk, and overwhelm'd.</p>
                     <p>But oh new wonder! as our LORD's fleſh and blood is the principle, that gives being to our new man; ſo is it his nutriment. And as in nature, things are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the ſame means that they were ſet up; ſo in grace, the new man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and increaſed, and ſtrengthened by the ſame blood of JESUS CHRIST, out of which he was formed. And that heavenly meat, and divine drink, which you ſhall anon receive from the hand of GOD, are not given you, but for the feeding, and perfecting of your new man. I go yet further, and durſt ſay, that this new man, whom the Apoſtle would at this time veſt you with, is none other, rightly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than the ſame JESUS CHRIST, whom we have put on at Baptiſm, and whom we receive in the Supper, propagated (if I may ſo ſpeak) and pourtrayed in us by His own vertue; who transformeth us into the likeneſs of His death and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by reaſon, that entring into, and dwelling in us, He formeth in us a man like Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that as He did, dyeth unto the fleſh; and with him, leaveth in his ſepulchre all his old life, as an infirm, and uſeleſs offal; and being enlivened with Him, and adorned with His light, and endowed with an heavenly nature leads thenceforth a ſpiritual, and glorious life. Thus you ſee, that the body of CHRIST was crucified, and His blood ſhed; and that the one and the other are given us in the Supper, to deveſt us of the old man, and veſt us with the new. This is the end and fruit of all that myſterie, unto the participation whereof you are this day called. Make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count then, that the beſt preparation you can bring unto it, is a ſerious meditating of what the Apoſtle doth here inform us. He exhorted the Coloſſians afore, to mortifie the vices of their fleſh, and all the infamous paſſions of that Pagan life, they had ſometime led in the darkneſs of their ignorance; as fornication, covetouſneſs, anger, evil ſpeaking, impurity of language, and lying. Now to cut up theſe and other like vices by the root, and to compriſe all the parts of ſanctification in few words, he commandeth us to <hi>put off the old man with his deeds,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>There are others, that take theſe words for a reaſon of his precedent exhortation, drawn from that eſtate which JESUS CHRIST had put them into by Baptiſm; as if his meaning were, that they are obliged to renounce the vices he had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them; ſince in their Baptiſm, they did put off the old man, on which theſe vices depend, and of which they make up a part; and put on the new, which is contrary to them, and incompatible with them. Whether you underſtand it thus, or take the text ſimply for a proſecution of the precedent command, ſhewing us, that for the due execution of it, we muſt perform what is here added, all amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to well-nigh the ſame ſenſe. And for the right comprehending of it, we will treat, if GOD permit, of the three points, which offer themſelves in the Apoſtle's words; firſt, of the old man, which we muſt put off; ſecondly, of the new, which we muſt put on, and the form it conſiſteth in, to wit, a renewing in knowledge, after the image of Him who created it: and in fine, of that indifferency of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ceremonies, and conditions, which the Apoſtle affirmeth in this matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring nothing in reference to it, but CHRIST, who is the all of it, and in all. May it pleaſe GOD ſo to inlighten our underſtandings for the right diſcerning of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truth, and touch our hearts to love, and practiſe it, effectually ſanctifying us by the vertue of His word, and precious Sacrament, that we may all go out hence new men, conformed in purity, and charity, and every vertue, to that LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, in whoſe name, and communion, we, by His grace, do glory.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture ſets before us the perſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of JESUS CHRIST, as two different ſtocks of mankind, or, as it were, two oppoſite heads, or principles of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50919:187"/>this nature, which we call humane. They have this in common, that both the one and the other hath a great number of children, which are iſſued from them, and do depend upon them; and that each of them doth communicate to his own, his being, his form, his life, and his condition, imprinting his image on them, which every of them beareth according to the quality of his extraction. They differ, or to ſay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are oppoſite, in that the one is earthy, the other heavenly; the one hath a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, vicious, infirm nature, full of ignorance and error, and ſubject to death, and the curſe. The other hath a ſpiritual, holy nature, full of light, and wiſdom, acceptable unto GOD, immortal, and inheriting eternity. The one propagateth in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſin, and death. The other communicates to his righteouſneſs, ſanctity, and life. The one tranſmits his nature by a carnal generation; the other imparteth his to his deſcendents, by a ſpiritual generation, and ſuch an one, as hath nothing in common with fleſh and blood. The nature of the one is deprav'd by the empoiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed breath of the old Serpent, which creepeth on the ground, and liveth on the duſt thereof. That of the other hath been formed, and conſerved by the Eternal, and coeleſtial Spirit. It's for theſe reaſons, that the Scripture calleth ſimply, the one, and the other of theſe two perſons, man, becauſe of their advantage, and their hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt and principal rank, each of them in his kind. For the ſame reaſon again, it gives the one and the other of theſe two perſons, the name <hi>Adam;</hi> becauſe they are each of them, the <hi>Adam,</hi> that is to ſay, the Father, and author of his order; the one of ſin, and death; the other of righteouſneſs, and life. But to diſtinguiſh them, it cals the one,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.47.</note> 
                        <hi>the firſt man, and the firſt Adam;</hi> the other, <hi>the ſecond man, and the laſt Adam.</hi> The former, him, who having corrupted himſelf by his diſobedience, hath alſo infected us, leaving us vice, and the curſe for an inheritance. The latter, Him, who having repaired our ſault by His obedience, hath given us righteouſneſs, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and immortality. <hi>Adam</hi> is ſtiled, <hi>the firſt man,</hi> and JESUS CHRIST <hi>the ſecond;</hi> for that the one's corrupting preceded the other's repairing, and reforming. <hi>Adam</hi> firſt defiled, and poiſoned his nature by ſin; and then JESUS CHRIST manifeſted His full of grace and truth. It's upon the ſame conſideration, that <hi>Adam</hi> is called <hi>the old man,</hi> and JESUS CHRIST <hi>then ne.</hi> Taking in withal, that <hi>the firſt</hi> Adam <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed;</hi> whereas the ſecond remains for ever. For its the cuſtome of Scripture, to call that old, which is ready to be done away; and that new, which is firm and laſting. But becauſe each of theſe two men doth communicate to thoſe that are his, the form and condition of his nature, according to that Scripture-principle, that <hi>what is born of the fleſh, is fleſh, and what is born of the Spirit, is Spirit;</hi> thence it comes, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> giving the effect the name of its cauſe, by a figure ordinary in all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, calls that form, and condition of nature, which each of us receives from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by carnal birth, the old man; and likewiſe, that form and condition which the faithful receive from JESUS CHRIST, by ſpiritual regeneration, <hi>the new man.</hi> This is that he means here, when he ſpeaks of <hi>putting off the old man, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the new;</hi> and elſe where, in a paſſage like to this, <hi>the truth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which we have learnt in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, is, that we put off the old man, concerning the former conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation who is corrupted by the luſts that ſeduce him;</hi> and that <hi>we put on the new man, created after GOD in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, as to that form of nature which we all receive from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by our carnal birth, every one well knoweth what it is, and in what it conſiſteth. For the Scripture declareth, and all mens experience alſo teacheth, that the nature of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam</hi> is extremely corrupt, and vicious; ſmitten in the underſtanding with an horrible ignorance, and blindneſs, and full of errors, and falſe and pernicious maxims; infected in the will with violent, and enraged love of a man's ſelf, of the fleſh, and of the earth, with bruitiſh affections and paſſions. This nature is nothing but pride, ambition, injuſtice, avarice, luxury, envy, hatred, malignity, imprudence, furiouſneſs, cruelty, and inhumanity. Such are all <hi>Adam</hi>'s progeny, while without the communion of JESUS CHRIST. There are no others born upon the earth; and whatever difference is between men, in regard of climate, and colour, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance of life, the blood they come of, imprinteth this wretched form upon them all in common; which ſeizing them at their birth, groweth up, and is augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with age, and exerciſe, rooting its ſelf in them, and thruſting forth the habitudes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50919:187"/>of divers ſins, which in the end render them unſufferable unto GOD, and their neighbours. And if the providence of Heaven, for the conſervation of mankind, did not repreſſs the curſed ſecondity of this evil, the diſorder, and the waſte it makes, would be much greater than it is, and proceed to infinite. It is then this maſs of corruption, this Hydra of vices; that the Apoſtle calls <hi>the old man;</hi> becauſe it is the production of <hi>Adam,</hi> our old, and firſt ſtock, in every one of us.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is eaſie to underſtand on the other hand, what the new man is, that is to ſay, the form which JESUS CHRIST, the principle of the ſecond creation, doth put upon each of them that are His. For it's directly contrary to that of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and comprehends in it all graces and vertues, in oppoſition to the other's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as faith, wiſdom, piety, charity, juſtice, ſweetneſs, honeſty, temperance; and in one word, a ſanctity like that of JESUS CHRIST, the image of which it is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. It's this that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſtiles <hi>the new man;</hi> becauſe it is the work, and likewiſe the pourtraict of the LORD JESUS, our new <hi>Adam.</hi> And he deſcribes it thus himſelf in this place. For, as to the old man, he only names it, without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more of it. But as for the new, he occaſionally explains us the nature of it, ſaying, that <hi>it is renewed in knowledge, after the image of Him who created it.</hi> In which few words he teacheth us, firſt, that it is created in us; that is, produced by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Divine power; by reaſon whereof we are called, <hi>the workmanſhip, and the creatures of GOD;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith elſe-where,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>.</note> that <hi>we were created in JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> whereas the production of the old man in us, is not a creation, but a natural operation. For as it is indeed in our power to kill a man, but there is none, ſave GOD alone, that can raiſe him up again; ſo it was eaſie for <hi>Adam</hi> to deſtroy himſelf, and us all with him; but to recover, and re-eſtabliſh us, belongs to GOD alone. <hi>Adam</hi> could corrupt, and deform our nature. But neither he, nor any of his, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> to repair, or reform it into a new man. This appertaineth to none but the Creator. It's the work of a Divine power. Then again, the Apoſtle ſhews us here, who it is that createth this new man in us, ſaying, that it's the ſame perſon, after whoſe image it is created. For it is clear, that the new man is after the image of JESUS CHRIST. It is then JESUS CHRIST that createth it in us. Vain man, give not the glory to your pretended free-will. It appertaineth wholly to the LORD. And we may truly ſay of this ſecond generation, what the Pſalmiſt ſingeth of the firſt: that <hi>it is the LORD, the eternal word of the Father,</hi>

                        <hi>who hath made us, and not we our ſelves.</hi> But the Apoſtle, in ſaying that this new man is renewed, doth teach us a further very conſiderable thing; to wit, that this piece of our regeneration, or the production of the new man, is poliſh'd, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by little and little in us, the Spirit of CHRIST working upon it, during the whole courſe of our life on earth; and adorning this its own creature by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reiterated operations, with the graces and ſpiritual beauties it ought to have, until it attain to the utmoſt and higheſt point of its perfection in the Heavens; when there ſhall be ſeen a compleat, and Angelical ſanctity, to ſhine forth in it, with glory, and bleſſed immortality.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Apoſtle doth alſo briefly touch at, both the manner after which, and the pattern by which this renovation is wrought in us. For the manner of it, he ſaith, That this new man is renewed in knowledge, thereby ſhewing, that JESUS CHRIST, for the communicating of this new Nature, which is in Him, as in its ſource, unto us, doth give us, and day by day augment the knowledge of his truth in us; for as ignorance and error is the firſt and principal deformity of the old Man, and the cauſe of all the reſt; ſo on the contrary, Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the firſt and principal lineament of the new Man, whereby are formed in us all the other vertues, in which it doth conſiſt, as Love of GOD, and Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, and all the other holy habitudes, which depend upon them; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſt, that we love none but the things we know, and proportionably to the knowledge we have of them. Wherefore the LORD begins the admirable work of his grace, hereat. And we have an excellent image of this method of his, in the firſt Creation of the World; where <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly obſerves, that the firſt thing GOD created by his Word, was Light, which is the ſymbol of Knowledge, as darkneſs is of Ignorance. This the Apoſtle plainly pointeth at elſewhere; <hi>GOD</hi>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:50919:188"/>(ſaith he) <hi>who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4 6.</note> 
                        <hi>hath ſhined into our hearts.</hi> This light of Knowledge once lighted up in our ſouls, by the Spirit of the LORD, doth preſently expel Vices out of them; and ſhewing us the holy and glorious face of GOD in JESUS CHRIST, transforms us into his likeneſs, as ſaith the ſame Apoſtle;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.18.</note> 
                        <hi>We all beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the LORD with open face, are transformed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the LORD.</hi> It's this he meaneth in the Text, when he ſaith of the new Man, that it is renewed after the image of him who created it, that is, of JESUS CHRIST our LORD. For he properly is the Pattern, by which that new Nature we are made partakers of, is formed. He is both the Author and Exemplar of it; and 'tis for this, that it is called by his Name, to wit, the new Man. Therefore the Apoſtle elſewhere, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the end and effect of his Miniſtry toward the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4.19.</note> ſaith, <hi>That he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velleth in birth, until CHRIST be formed in them.</hi> He had no other deſign, but to reveſt them with the new Man: Certainly then, the new Man is nothing elſe but JESUS CHRIST formed in us; that is, nothing elſe but the form of this holy and bleſſed LORD, engraven and imprinted on us by the ſeal of his Word and Spirit; which is preciſely the thing he here calls his Image. If you know JESUS CHRIST, you cannot be ignorant what this his form and image is. JESUS CHRIST is the Saint of Saints; a man full of all purity, righteouſneſs, charity, patience, conſtancy and truth; and in ſum of all the lights of holineſs. Sure then his form and image can be no other, than a genuine repreſentation of theſe Divine qualities; a ſoul in which appears a goodneſs, an humility, an honeſty, I ſay not, equal, (for it is not poſſible to arrive unto ſo high a perfection) but at leaſt ſemblable and proportionate to his. And this is that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere compriſeth expreſly in two words, ſaying, That <hi>the new man is created after GOD, in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee, Brethren, what that Old, and what this new Man is which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in this place: The one is the image of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and the other of the ſecond. He commandeth us to put off the old Man with his Deeds, and to put on the New; a manner of ſpeaking, no leſs elegant, than familiar in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is wont to ſay of all the things that are found in this or that ſubject, that it is clothed with them. As when the Prophets ſay, that GOD is clothed with ſtrength, with Glory, and with Magnificence; that he is cloathed with Juſtice; that he will cloath his Prieſts with ſalvation, and their enemies with ſhame; that he will cloath the Heavens with darkneſs, and ſo in a multitude of other places; where it is evident, that the term, <hi>Cloathing,</hi> is taken figuratively, to expreſs ſimply, the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any thing in ſuch or ſuch a Subject, whether it be internally or externally. Whence it follows, that, to put off, on the contrary, is ſimply to quit a thing which one had, and rid himſelf of it. Thus to put off the old Man, is nothing elſe but to rid our ſelves of his Vices, and of his corruptneſs; to pluck up, for inſtance, out of our hearts, his covetouſneſs, and his ambition, and the habitudes of his other ſins. But the Apoſtle expreſly addeth, that we put him off with his deeds; that is to ſay, that we not only pluck up out of our hearts, the habits of Vices, which are, as it were, the roots and ſtocks of it; but that alſo we cut off from our lives, all the actions, whether interior, as deſires and luſtings; or exterior, as other ſins, which proceed from the ſame, and are as ſo many fruits of this accurſed plant. For, to ſpeak properly, the old man is one thing; and the act of ſin, that iſſues from it, another. The one is the corruptneſs it ſelf of our nature; the other is the effect it produceth: The one is as the Plant, and the other as its Fruit. For example, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or covetouſneſs is one of the very members of the old Man; murder or ſtealing ing are acts of it. The Apoſtle would have us put off the one, and the other; that neither Vice, nor its acts might have any place in us. In like manner, to put on the new Man, is on the other hand, to deck and adorn our underſtanding, our will, our affections, and all the parts of our life, with thoſe excellent vertues, in which the new man conſiſteth, as we have ſaid afore; to endeavour it ſtudiouſly, and take no reſt, till we have them formed in us, and our whole nature be covered, and enriched with them.</p>
                     <p>But though theſe two words, to put off, and to put on, be in this paſſage figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively taken, yet do they ſhew us notwithſtanding, againſt the groſs and ſenſleſs er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50919:188"/>of ſome, that as well the old Man, as the New, do both of them ſignifie the form and diſpoſition, not the ſubſtance and very eſſence of our nature: For when a thing is utterly deſtroyed, we do not ſay, it puts off what it had, but that it is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth. And when the ſubſtance of a thing is produced altogether of new, we ſay not, that it's cloathed, but created; ſo as the Apoſtle here commanding us to put off the old man, and put on the new; it is evident, that in this renovation of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we do not loſe the very ſubſtance of it, nor acquire another new one; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quit that unworthy and wretched form, which ſin gave it; and aſſume another, which reſembles that of JESUS CHRIST. I acknowledge, that that old form which we put off, had ſeized on, and blaſted, and disfigured all the parts of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both internal and external; as alſo, that the new one, which we receive in JESUS CHRIST, doth extend its ſelf likewiſe to them all; in which reſpect the one and the other differeth from a garment, which covers but the outſide, and reaches not further in: yet they both are notwithſtanding, another thing than the Subject it ſelf, which is uncloth'd or cloath'd with them, as an habit is another kind of thing than the body it covereth. The one is at it were the ruſt, as it were the poyſon, the malady, the loathſomneſs and deformity of our nature: The other is the beauty, the health, the perfection, the ornament, and honour of it; and as it were the jewel, that gives it all it hath of worth and value. Neither let the terms of Old and new Man trouble you: For they are often made uſe or in all languages, to ſignifie the qualities, and not the very eſſentials of our nature; as when we ſay of a perſon, who was once vicious and debauched, but is now become honeſt and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that he is another man, a new Man; though, to ſpeak properly, he have the ſame ſubſtance, the ſame ſoul, and the ſame body, he had before; and hath quitted nothing of his former nature, but the bad habitudes it was veſted with, not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Being. Thus it is in regard of the Old and new Man: The ſubſtance of the ſubject remains the ſame, under the one and the other. There is nothing changed but its form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and quality. And it's thus alſo, that we are to underſtand what, after the Prophets, S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath ſaid, namely,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.13.</note> That <hi>at the laſt manifeſtation of the Son of GOD, there ſhall be new Heavens and a new Earth:</hi> For theſe creatures which now ſubſiſt, ſhall not be annihilated. On the contrary, S <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.20.</note> That they ſhall have part in the deliverance of the ſons of GOD; but becauſe they ſhall be purged from all vanity, and put into an eſtate much more excellent, than that wherein they now ſigh and languiſh, therefore they are called, new Heavens and a new Earth.</p>
                     <p>As for what remains, The Apoſtle injoyns us expreſly, both here and elſewhere, to put off the old Man, and to put on the New; becauſe in truth theſe are two different things, even as to depart from evil, and to do good. It is very true, that in the eſtate men are, no one puts off the old Man, but puts on the New; and ſo on the contrary; and again as true it is, that the ſame Spirit of JESUS CHRIST, which effecteth the one, doth alſo effect the other; even as the Sun, by one and the ſame action, diſpelleth the darkneſs of our Air, and diffuſeth into it light: yet this hin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ers not, but that, conſidering the matter ſimply, and abſolutely in its ſelf; the putting off of the old Man is one thing, and the putting on of the New another. For the corruption of the old Man is not a meer abſence and privation of the ſanctity of the New, neither is vertue a meer privation of vice, as darkneſs is nothing at all, but a ſimple privation of light: Otherwiſe, it were to be ſaid, that the new man is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, where the Old is not; and ſo on the contrary, as where there is no light, darknes doth of neceſſity take place, and ſo on the contrary. But though theſe two actions of putting off the old Man, and putting on the New, be different in themſelves, yet are they inſeparably joyned with one another; and in the ſtate we now are, it is not poſſible that any perſon ſhould deveſt himſelf of ſin, and of the miſery of his old Man, without veſting himſelf with the New; becauſe there is no other way of ſalvation, but the Communion of CHRIST, into which no one ever enters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting on the new Man. It's in this, that all our ſalvation conſiſteth.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe thoſe falſe Teachers, which troubled the Church at that time, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the prejudice of this Doctrine, that Circumciſion and divers other external things were neceſſary in Religion, as if they were ſufficient to ſave us without the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50919:189"/>new Man; or at leaſt the new Man were not ſufficient to ſave us without them; the Apoſtle doth reject this error of theirs here, which he refuted afore; and to this purpoſe, in ſpeaking of the new Man, addeth, <hi>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, neither circumciſion nor uncircumciſion, neither Barbarian nor Scythian, nor bond, nor free; but CHRIST is all, and in all.</hi> His meaning is not, that among thoſe whom JESUS CHRIST converteth to new men, by vertue of his Goſpel, there are none that be by extraction, <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Greeks, Barbarians</hi> or <hi>Scythians;</hi> and for condition, bond or free, circumciſed or uncircumciſed; nor likewiſe, that theſe differences are in themſelves none, or ought not to be conſidered at all, either in nature, or in the ſtate and politick order. On the contrary, he himſelf will hereafter eſtabliſh the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of bond-men, and free, and command us to obſerve it in civil life. But what he ſaith, muſt be reſtrained, and appropriated preciſely to his intention and deſign, without extending it any further, He ſpeaks of the new man, and ſaith, that no one of theſe differences doth take place in him. He meaneth therefore ſimply, that in this reſpect (that is, in what concerns the nature of the new man) all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent qualities and conditions are no way conſiderable; that, as to it, they have no force nor vertue; that neither the nobleneſs of the Jew, nor the advantage of circumciſion, nor the liberty of the free, doth ſerve at all, to bring us neer the new man, and communicate him to us; that the knowledge of the Greek, and the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Barbarian, and the uncircumſion of the Gentile, and the meanneſs of the ſlave, doth not remove us further off from him. That a man, both may not participate of him with the firſt of theſe qualities, and may with the laſt. It's the ſame thing that he ſaith elſe-where;
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.15.</note> even that <hi>in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature;</hi> and again, <hi>That in CHRIST,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">&amp; 3.28.</note> 
                        <hi>there is neither Jew nor Greek, nor bond nor free, nor male nor female, becauſe they are all one in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He excludes hereby, firſt, the pretended advantage of the <hi>Jew</hi> above the <hi>Greek.</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo fooliſhly preſum'd upon their birth, that they imagin'd it ſufficient to render them acceptable unto GOD, and they haughtily diſdained the <hi>Greeks</hi> as accurſed and abominable, by the ſole infelicity of their extraction. The men of <hi>Rome</hi> are at this day no wiſer; as who do not define Chriſtianity, but by an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the See of their City. The Apoſtle here doth thunder-ſtrike the vanity of the one and the others, proclaiming that neither the <hi>Jew</hi> nor the <hi>Greek,</hi> and by conſequent, not the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Italian,</hi> are of any conſideration in godlineſs, ſo as to confer upon us, or deprive us of the new Man.

Though theſe qualities put a difference between them on earth, they put none between them in Heaven, nor in the myſtical body of our LORD and Saviour, into which GOD receiveth us all indifferently, if He ſee the new man in us, and doth equally exclude thoſe in whom He finds it not.

                     <p>Dear Brethren, It's this ſame bleſſed LORD, the fountain, and the fulneſs of all good, that GOD preſenteth to you at this time, in His word, and in His Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Come ye all to Him, ſeeing He is ſo bountifully offered unto you. Let no one imagine either that he may do well enough without Him, or that He may not enjoy Him. He is both neceſſary for the greateſt, and acceſſible unto the leaſt. The dignity of Maſters, the abundance of riches, the extraction of the noble, the obſervances of the devout, and ſuch other advantages will be of no uſe at all to ſave thoſe that have them; ſo that JESUS CHRIST is no leſs neceſſary for them, than if they had them not. The low eſtate of ſervants, the diſtreſſedneſs of the poor, and the like other diſadvantages, do hinder no one from approaching, and receiving of Him. And as the brazen Serpent, which ſometime figured him in the deſert, was communicated indifferently unto all, great and ſmall, poor and rich, noble and ignoble; and equally cured all thoſe that looked on it: and again, as there was no remedy to be had againſt the biting of the fiery Serpents, but that alone: neither riches, nor nobility, nor ſcience, nor any other quality could cure any of them. So is it with our LORD JESUS. He is equally both neceſſary, and approachable
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50919:190"/>for all. He offers Himſelf to the great; He diſdaineth not the leaſt. He gives Himſelf to the one, and to the others, and ſaves them all indifferently. Come ye th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Lift up your eyes on Him, and behold Him ſtretched out for you upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s pole; crucified for your ſins, and wounded for your iniquities, His fleſh pierced with nails, His blood ſpilt on the ground: preſenting to you in this ſcandalous, but ſalutiferous infirmity; the treaſure of life and happineſs. Bring unto Him ſouls full of faith, reſpect, and love; and prepare for the receiving of Him, not your bodily mouth, or ſtomach, (places, what-ever ſuperſtition ſay, unworthy to lodge Him) but your hearts, your minds, your underſtandings and affections; that is, the nobler part of your being. There it is that He takes pleaſure, there it is that He would dwell. Accordingly it's there that He ſhould operate, and diſplay His vertue, unto the extinguiſhing of the old man, and the engraving of His own image. As the body is not the object of this operation of His; ſo neither is it the ſeat of His preſence, nor the throne of His Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>But you plainly ſee, My Brethren, that this incomparable favour He placeth on you, in being willing to come, and dwell in your hearts, doth oblige you to put off His enemie the old man, and clear your ſelves of all His pollutions; eradicate the habitudes of all his vices; ſmother all his deſires, and cleanſe your whole life from all his deeds. This old man is the diſgrace of your nature, the poiſon of your ſoul, the death of your life, the cauſe of your unhappineſs. It's he that deſtroyed you, that baniſh'd you out of Paradiſe, that bereav'd you of your true delights, that made you ſubject unto vanity, and the wrath of GOD, and the hatred of His Angels, and the tyrannie of Devils.

All his ſtrength conſiſteth only in our cowardice; in our feebleneſs, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy. JESUS CHRIST hath taken from him all the true ſtrength he had. He hath crucified him, and overthrown all the foundations of his tyrannie, and of his life, diſcovering to us the horridneſs thereof, and opening us the way to liberty, and the gate of the houſe of GOD. Inſtead of this wretched, and fordid, and ſhameful form of life, let us put on that new man, who now preſents, and gives Himſelf unto us. Let us have Him night and day before our eyes, as the only exemplar of our true nature. Let us copy Him all out, and faithfully engrave upon our ſouls all the features of His Divine, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious form.

                     <p>Dear Brethren, it muſt be acknowledged, that hitherto we have greatly failed in this duty. For what is more unlike, than we, and this JESUS CHRIST, to whoſe image we ſhould be conformed? He is humble, and meek, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He lov'd the greateſt ſtrangers, and we hate our neereſt neighbours. He was moſt pure, and holy; and we are polluted with the ordures of intemperance. He ſought only His Father's glory, and the ſalvation of men. We muſe upon nothing but earth, and conſider only our own intereſts; With this diſſimilitude, or to ſay better, contrariety, how can we pretend to have put on the new man, which is created
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50919:190"/>after the image of JESUS CHRIST? And how can it be thought, but that we rather bear the image of His enemie? Yet you are not ignorant what depends upon it; and do well know, that it is not poſſible to have part on high in the glory of the new man, except we put him on here below. In the name of GOD, Beloved Brethren, and as your own ſalvation is dear to you, travel on this great and neceſſary deſign. Repair the negligences of the time paſs'd; and diſcharging for the future, with good fidelity, what the Apoſtle's word, and the Sacrament of this myſtical table, do equally require of you; put off the old man, who hath deſtroyed you; Put on the new man, who hath ſav'd you, renewing you in the knowledge, and unto the likeneſs of this ſweet, and merciful LORD, who died, and is riſen again for you; that after you have born on earth the image of His holineſs, and charity, you may bear it eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Heavens, together with that of His glory, and immortality. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren, That which the Sacrament of the LORD's holy Supper requireth of us, and which it effecteth and produceth in us, when we duly receive it, is the very thing which the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us in this Text; and unto which he formeth us by theſe words of his. He willeth, that we be merciful, kind, humble, meek, patient and facile to pardon one another. And the end and effect of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is, to make us ſo: For it communicateth the LORD JESUS CHRIST unto us, not that the ſubſtance of his Body may enter into ours, nor that his fleſh may be touched by our mouths and ſtomacks (a thing both prodigious and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which is moreover unprofitable and ſuperfluous) but indeed to transforms us into his Image, and render us like him, that is, humble, meek, patient, kind and merciful as he is, forming theſe divine vertues in us by the eſſicacy of his Death, which is celebrated in this Myſterie. Whereby you ſee a notable difference between the heavenly food which we receive in this Sacrament, and the earthly meat we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take; for whereas the latter is, for the nouriſhing of our bodies, chang'd into their nature; the former, on the contrary, for the enlivening of our ſouls, transform them into its own. Thus, ſince we have participated this Morning of this precious Sacrament, we cannot better employ the preſent hour, than in meditating theſe words of the Apoſtle, which contain and repreſent one of its principal effects. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them therefore, my Brethren, attentively. And that we may diſcern whether or no we have truly communicated of the bread of Heaven, let us examine whether it hath produced and formed in our hearts that humility and kindneſs, and all thoſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50919:191"/>other vertues, which the Apoſtle enjoyns us in this place; and reckon we, that without this, neither the LORD's favour in inviting us unto his Table, nor the heavenly food there preſented us, will benefit us at all; and that remaining far from contributing to our ſalvation, it will aggravate our condemnation, according to the Apoſtles ſaying in another place, That <hi>whoever cateth of the bread of the LORD, and drinketh of his cup unworthily, eateth and drinketh his own judgment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>S. Paul,</hi> if you remember, having in general exhorted the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to mortifie the members of the old Man, did particularly nominate and ſpecifie to them ſome of his principal Vices, as covetouſneſs, fornication, malignity, wrath, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, expreſly injoyning them to put them away: But becauſe it is not enough to forbear evil, there muſt alſo be a doing good; and it ſufficeth not that we abſtain from vice, if we do not exerciſe the actions of vertue: This great Apoſtle having forbidden the luſts and fins of the old Man, commands us firſt in general, to put on the New, as you heard a week ſince; and then in the progreſs of his ſpeech, he pointeth at ſome of the principal parts of this new Man, by name. It is preciſely at the Verſes we have read, that he begins this diſcourſe; <hi>Put on then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as elected of GOD, Saints and Beloved, bowels of mercy,</hi> &amp;c. — This exhortation he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the precedent Verſes, and propoſeth us at the entrance, a reaſon that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us unto this purſuit, taken from the honour GOD hath done us, to chooſe us for his Saints and his Beloved. Next, he commands us compaſſion, benignity, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, meekneſs, patience; five Vertues, that refer, as you ſee, to the manner after which we are to carry our ſelves towards our neighbours, and particularly towards thoſe of them that ſuffer evil, or do us any. Afterwards he pointeth out two acts of patience and benignity; the one is a bearing with, and the other the pardoning of one another; and to incite us to them, he adds the example our LORD and Saviour hath given us of them. So we ſhall have three Points to treat of in this action, if the LORD will; Firſt, the quality of elected of GOD, Saints and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, which the Apoſtle gives us at the entrance, to ſway us to our duty. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the five Vertues which he recommends unto us, and the exerciſing of them in the matter of that forbearance and mutual forgiveneſs which we owe one another. And finally, in the third place, the example of JESUS CHRIST, which he ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, as an accompliſht pattern, and a moſt effectual argument of our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. Dear Brethren, hear, meditate, and duly put in practiſe that Divine Leſſon, which the LORD JESUS gave you this Morning in the Myſterie of his Table, and now repeats by the mouth of his Apoſtle.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle deduceth it from what he had generally aſſerted in the precedent Verſes, namely, that we have put on the new Man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him who created him. Thence he now concludes, <hi>Put on then bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of mercy, kindneſs, humility, meekneſs, patience.</hi> The conſequence is evident. For ſince we do put on the new Man in JESUS CHRIST, it is clear, that theſe Vertues being as they are, members and parts of this new Man, it's a duty of ours to put them on; and that in defect of them, this new Nature, which makes us Chriſtians, would remain imperfect in us. Brethren, Mark well this reaſoning, and learn by it, how hugely they deceive themſelves, who pretend, without theſe Vertues, unto the name and inheritance of Chriſtians; imagining that they are not neceſſary for all, but only meet for ſuch as will be perfecter and more excellent than the commonalty of the faithful. It's a principle laid down in divers places by the Apoſtle, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the whole Church, that no man is in CHRIST, except he be a new Creature. And himſelf teacheth us here, that whoever is a new Creature, muſt put on compaſſion, and thoſe other Vertues he nameth in order; ſure it follows then, that whoſoever hath not put them on, is not a new Creature, nor by conſequent a Chriſtian. If therefore you will be Chriſtians; if you will aſpire to ſalvation, which GOD gives to none, but thoſe that are ſo; renounce that pernicious error, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the purſuit of all theſe Vertues with vigorous reſolution, travelling inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it, until you have veſted your ſouls with their habitudes, ſentiments and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and fill'd your whole life with their actions.</p>
                     <p>It's the thing to which you are alſo evidently obliged, by the dignity of being the Elect, the Saints, and the beloved of GOD, which you are ſtated in, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

We uſe the word <hi>as,</hi> to the ſame ſenſe often in our common ſpeech: As for example, when we ſay of a good man, that he liv'd and dy'd religiouſly, as a Chriſtian, that is, ſo as was meet for that quality of Chriſtian which he had; and when we adviſe a young man of good rank, to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Of theſe three qualities, which the Apoſtle here gives the faithful, the firſt is, that they are elected of GOD. The election of God is the choice. He makes, according to his good pleaſure, of certain perſons to call them unto the knowledge of himſelf, and unto the glory of his ſalvation. And this term, <hi>Election,</hi> ſignifies, ſometimes the reſolution he hath taken in his eternal counſel, to chooſe and call them, which the Scripture elſewhere calls,
<note place="margin">Eph. 1.11.</note> 
                        <hi>The determinate purpoſe of GOD;</hi> ſometimes the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this eternal determination, when GOD doth in time, touch the men of his good pleaſure by the efficacy of his Word and Spirit, converting them to the faith of his Goſpel, and ſeparating them by this means from the reſt of men, who continue in the miſerable eſtate of their nature, through their impenitence and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. The Apoſtle, in my opinion, does comprehend both the one and the other of theſe two ſenſes, when he ſaith here, That <hi>we are elected of GOD,</hi> that is, ſuch as he hath choſen, and effectively ſeparated from the world, according to his determinate purpoſe, calling us unto himſelf, to ſerve him according to the diſcipline of his Goſpel. Now that this quality doth oblige us to put on all the vertues which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends unto us in the words following, is evident. For this very thing is the aim and end of his Election, as the Apoſtle elſewhere informs us, when he ſaith, That <hi>GOD hath elected us in CHRIST,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1.4.</note> 
                        <hi>that we might be holy and blameleſs before him in love.</hi> And it's that that <hi>Moſes</hi> yerwhile repreſented to ancient <hi>Iſrael</hi> the type of the new;
<note place="margin">Deut. 26.18.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath ſet thee on high this day</hi> (that is, hath raiſed thee above other Nations by his election) <hi>that thou might'ſt be to him a peculiar people, and keep his commandments.</hi> Whence appears how falſe their calumny is, who accuſe the doctrine of Election, of favouring vice and impenitency. If it were ſo, what could have leſs of reaſon in it, than the Apoſtles diſcourſe, who alledgeth our election, to incite us unto the ſtudious purſuance of holineſs? But it is quite otherwiſe than theſe men pretend. As GOD's election is the ſource of ſanctification and good works; ſo the aſſerting and teaching of it, is an eſtabliſhing and a founding of them. And they that make their boaſt of their being elected of GOD, but mean time lead a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and profane life, do mock GOD and men; and ſhall infallibly periſh in this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50919:192"/>falſe and vain error, if they amend not. For ſince GOD's election is never executed without converting a man, and ſanctifying him; and it is not poſſible on the other hand, that any one ſhould know himſelf elected otherwiſe, than by feeling the real execution of his election; it is evidently raſhneſs, and a palpable error to imagine that one is elected, except he be truly converted unto GOD, and indu'd with pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and charity.</p>
                     <p>Another quality which the Apoſtle here gives us, is, that we are Saints: For he is not of the opinion of <hi>Rome,</hi> who calls none Saints, but thoſe whom ſhe hath ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth none for believers who are not Saints. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly you know, that in the Creed, the Church, which is the body of all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and not of the canonized only, is called holy, and the communion of Saints. Indeed, ſince there is not a Chriſtian but hath been baptized into JESUS CHRIST, and receiv'd the holy Ghoſt, according to the Apoſtles ſaying elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> That <hi>if any man have not the Spirit of CHRIST, he is none of his:</hi> How can he be a Chriſtian, who is not a Saint? Seeing both Baptiſm and the Spirit of CHRIST do ſanctifie all thoſe to whom they are truly communicated? Now, that this quality of Saints, or holy Ones, doth alſo oblige us to all the vertues that the Apoſtle gives us in charge, in the following Verſes, is as clear as the Sun at noon-day: For what elſe is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf, but a piety, and an exquiſite charity, compleat in all its parts, and adorned with every vertue? Beſides, by ſanctification we are dedicated and conſecrated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD, ſo as henceforth we ought not to diſpoſe of our ſelves but for his ſervice, and according to his will; which is no other, but that we live in all purity, honeſty, and vertue. And this is that the LORD ſignifieth, when he ſo often chargeth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be holy: <hi>You ſhall he holy unto me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for I am holy;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lev. 11.44. &amp; 20.26.</note> 
                        <hi>and have ſeparated you from other people to be mine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third quality the Apoſtle gives us here, is, That we are the Beloved of GOD; that is to ſay, thoſe of all men, whom he moſt loveth, and dearly reſpecteth in his Son JESUS CHRIST. Since then, the love wherewith God honoureth us, does ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to love him, and that we cannot fail of this reciprocal love, without herrible ingratitude; it is evident that our being the beloved of GOD, doth neceſſarily require of us, that we put on all theſe vertues, which the Apoſtle is about to give us in charge: Firſt, becauſe it is a neceſſary and infallible effect of the love we bear to GOD, to do what he commands us, and he commands us nothing elſe,
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.15.</note> but the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of every vertue. <hi>If you love me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>keep my commandments.</hi> Secondly, becauſe true love transformeth him that loveth, into the image of the thing loved; ſo as GOD being charity, juſtice, and holineſs it ſelf, it is not poſſible if we love him truly, but that we put on all theſe divine Vertues. Thus you ſee, Believers, that the honour we have, to be elected of GOD, Saints and Beloved, doth moſt ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to do what the Apoſtle commands us, that is, to embrace all the vertues he is about to repreſent unto us; which he expreſſeth in one word, bidding us, <hi>put them on,</hi> that is, that we ſeat them in our hearts, and ſhew them in our lives; that we deck our ſouls with their habits, and adorn our manners with their acts. For it's this is ſignified by the word <hi>put on,</hi> here figuratively uſed, according to the uſual ſtile of Scripture; as we gave you notice, in expounding the precedent Text, where the Apoſtle exhorted us to put off the old Man, and put on the New.</p>
                     <p>The foremoſt of theſe Vertues which he recommends unto us, are thoſe five which he does expreſly nominate in the preſent Text, mercy, kindneſs, humility, meekneſs and patience. Mercy is a goodneſs and tenderneſs of ſpirit, which cauſeth us to reſent the miſeries of others, and have compaſſion on them, and take part in them, as if we ſuffered them our ſelves. And the Apoſtle, to ſhew us how quick and deep this ſentiment ſhould be in us, would have us to put on, not mercy ſimply, but bowels of mercy, which is a form of ſpeaking taken from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> language, in which the word <hi>Bowels</hi> is often uſed, to ſignifie the reſentments of piety, and the tenderneſſes of compaſſion; and this not without reaſon, it being clear, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion doth affect and hugely move the heart, the principal of our internal parts. It is not enough, that we lodge pity in our faces, and in our looks, externally ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the movings and appearences of it. The miſeries of our neighbours muſt deſcend into our hearts, and reach the depth of our bowels; they muſt affect them with a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50919:193"/>real grief, that may move them, and ſtir up all that is in our power, to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording of them ſuccour. For the diſcipline of JESUS CHRIST doth not at all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the rigidneſs of the Stoick Philoſophy; which pluck'd up mercy as well as other paſſions out of the bowels of its Wiſe man; as if to reſent trouble, or grief, were a thing unworthy of a vertuous perſon. Let him remedy the miſeries of others (ſaid they;) but let him not feel them. Let him ſuccour the men, but let him not be touched with their paſſion. Firſt, that which they preſuppoſe is falſe; namely, that to ſuffer one's ſelf to be touched with ſentiment of grief, is a defiling, or polluting of vertue. There's nothing unworthy of true vertue, but vice: now grief is not a vice; it is a ſimple ſentiment of nature: and for the being wiſe, it is not needful a man ſhould renounce the ſentiments of nature; it is ſufficient to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, and keep them within their bounds, and uſe them with reaſon. Again, this inſenſibility, which they ſuppoſe is a chimera, and a fiction of their own, which cannot take place in the ſoul of man, which GOD hath formed unto ſweetneſs, and tenderneſs, more than any other creature; as is evident by tears, of which none none but man is capable; Laſtly, whereas they would have the wiſe man ſuccour the miſerable, without reſenting their miſery, this is both difficult and dangerous. For it is a taking away one of the ſharpeſt incitements that ſpurs us on to aſſiſt them; it being clear, that nothing moves us more powerfully thereto, than compaſſion. We muſt not (as thoſe people ſaid) remedy other mens miſeries without feeling them, (which is both difficult in our nature, and unprofitable, though it were eaſie) but quite contrary, we muſt feel them, that we may remedy them. So likewiſe there is nothing more cold, and leſs helpful, than theſe inſenſible perſons. For eradicating compaſſion out of our hearts, they put in them obdurateneſs, and inhumanity, which are infinitely more contrary to true Vertue, than grief and emotion.</p>
                     <p>Renounce we then, Beloved Brethren, this rough and inhumane philoſophy. Let it be no ſhame to us to be tender, and ſenſible of our neighbours miſeries. Let us hold compaſſion, not for an infirmity, but for a vertue, unto which GOD calleth us, both by His commands, and by the examples, as of His Saints, ſo of His Son Himſelf, JESUS CHRIST our LORD.
<note place="margin">Luke 6.36. 1 Pet. 3.8.</note> 
                        <hi>Be ye merciful,</hi> ſaith He; and one of His Apoſtles exhorteth us, to <hi>be full of mutual compaſſion, pityful, courteous.</hi> And our St. <hi>Paul</hi> goes ſo ſar,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.15.</note> as he would have us <hi>weep with them that weep;</hi> and the truth is, our tears, and our reſentments, though we can do nothing elſe, afford yet ſome eaſe to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. The Saints, of whom we are told in Scripture, have all of them this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of ſweetneſs, and humanity. They were tender, and full of compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all afflicted perſons: and to alledge no other examples, you know how the miſeries of men did touch, and pierce the heart of our LORD and Saviour; who wept when He ſaw <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s grave, and of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>He is apt to have pity on the ignorant,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 5.2. Heb. 4.15.</note>

For men being our neighbours, that is, of one and the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are; who ſees not, but that it is reaſonable we ſhould be touched with their miſeries? And this the rather, for that it may betide us to fall into the like our ſelves, and one day need that compaſſion and ſuccour they now crave of us?</p>
                     <p>After the movings of compaſſion, the Apoſtle commandeth of us, the ſuccour and offices of benignity; which is a goodneſs of nature, that takes pleaſure in, and makes it its ſtudy to ſerve, and oblige every one, and incommodate, or diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige no body; that readily ſtretcheth out its helping hand to the afflicted, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicateth its goods to the neceſſitous. A thing which GOD commands us every where in His word, willing us there to be communicative; to break our bread to the hungry, and impart of our ſubſtance to thoſe that need. The charge of ſtewards, or diſpencers, which he hath given us, obligeth us thereto; For He hath put into our hands all the wealth we do poſſeſs; to the end we ſhould prudently and charitably diſpence it to our neighbours. And as He promiſeth great benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and recompences, as well in this life, as alſo in the next, to thoſe that acquit themſelves faithfully of this duty, and are kind and beneficent; ſo doth He menace all thoſe that ſhall fail to do it, with grievous and eternal puniſhments, and treats them at every turn, as perſons not only cruel, and inhumane, but alſo unequitable, and unjuſt.</p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:50919:193"/>
                     <p>Unto mercy, and kindneſs, the Apoſtle willeth that we add humility; the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fis and foundation of all Chriſtian Vertues: the ornament of a believing ſoul, the mother of patience, the nurſe of charity. There is no diſpoſition of ſoul more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to GOD, or more profitable unto men. I confeſs, the exerciſing of it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult unto man, naturally proud, and wilful. But the light of the Goſpel of CHRIST, and the power of His grace, do render that eaſie to us, which is hard of it ſelf. The pride of man, ſure, ſpringeth not but from his ignorance. If he knew himſelf as he ought, he would be humble, and inſtead of glorying in, be aſhamed of himſelf. Why then do not we, who know the vanity of our being, the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our bodies, the malignity of our hearts, the ignorance and folly of our minds, the perverſeneſs of our affections, the uncertainty and miſery of our life, the demerit of our ſins, and the eternal woe whereof they are worthy; I ſay, why do we not clothe our ſelves all over with a ſincere and profound humility? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe conſideratons, how can we have any puff of pride? If you tell me; it is true, you were ſuch by nature, but that the grace of JESUS CHRIST hath made you otherwiſe; I anſwer, that herein you have cauſe indeed to acknowledge, and glorifie His bounty; but none to lift up your ſelves. For you have nothing that is good, but you received it of GOD; and if you have received it, why do ye boaſt of it? The more He hath given you, the more ought you to humble your ſelves: as thoſe branches bow moſt, and hang down loweſt, which are moſt laden with fruit. Thus you ſee, that being nothing in your ſelves, and having received of GOD all that you can have, it is juſt that you be humble: not to report here either the command for it, which GOD gives us in a thouſand places, or the graces He promiſeth unto humility, or the pattern of it, which He ſets before us in His Son JESUS CHRIST, or the ruine wherewith He menaceth the haughty.</p>
                     <p>After humility, the Apoſtle lodgeth two of its daughters in our ſouls, namely, meekneſs, and patience. Meekneſs is properly that which we call gentleneſs; the greateſt grace of our behaviour, and the amiableſt ornament of our life. It receives every one with an open heart, and a pleaſing countenance. It is not eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, and as far as it can, takes all things in good part. It is aſſable, and judgeth not with rigour. It reſtrains the ſtirrings of choler, and notwithſtanding the occaſions offered for it, keeps, and maintains it ſelf in a ſweet calm, without becoming angry, eaſily receiving as far as reaſon permitteth, the excuſes of thoſe that have offended it, and being much more readily appeaſed, than irritated. As this vertue is very grateful to others, ſo is it exceedingly profitable, and beneficial to our ſelves. For living with men, that is to ſay, with weak, and wretched creatures; without gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſweetneth all things, we muſt needs be in a continual irritation, and never have joy, nor repoſe. Patience is the ſiſter of gentleneſs, they do both of them bear vexations things, without exaſperation; only with this difference; that gentleneſs is exerciſed in reference to the fullenneſs, the ſottiſhneſs, and the impertinency of thoſe we converſe with; patience undergoeth other greater evils, as outrages, and affronts, and thoſe very afflictions which are ſent us of GOD, as ſickneſſes, and loſſes, and the like.</p>
                     <p>But for the better clearing of the nature of theſe two Vertues, the Apoſtle parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly recommends unto us two eminent acts of them, extremely neceſſary for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and of ſingular uſe in our whole life; when he addeth, <hi>bearing with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and pardoning one another, if one hath a quarrel againſt the other.</hi> The firſt of theſe two acts pertaineth as well unto meekneſs, as to patience. For firſt, if there be any defect, either in the humour, or in the perſon, or even in the faith, and piety of our brethren, (provided it be not a capital crime, that tendeth to the overthrow of religion, and ſalvation) we ought not for this, break with them, nor reject, or ſadden them: but bear with them with all ſweetneſs, remembring both the need we have, that the like equity and condeſcendance be uſed towards us in many things, wherein we are no more perfect, than our brethren in the fore-mentioned; and the example of our LORD and Saviour, who according to the Prophet's prediction,

                        <hi>did not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoking flax.</hi> Then in the ſecond place, if our neighbours have offended us, either by word, or deed, we muſt not forthwith betake our ſelves unto revenge; as men of the world do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> but endeavour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50919:194"/>them by ſweetneſs, bearing their wronging us with a Chriſtian and generous reſolution. The other act that the Apoſtle commandeth us, and which likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects thoſe two vertues, is, our pardoning one another, if one hath a quarrel againſt the other. This is yet more than our bearing with one another, which he firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us: For there are people found, that bear with the fullenneſs or the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of their neighbour, yea with his offences, whether it be that they have not the means to avenge themſelves, or that they count it not expedient to do it for the preſent; who mean time, keep and brood upon their reſentments, in the ſecret of their hearts, waiting for an opportunity to ſhew them with advantage. Wherefore the Apoſtle is not content to tell us, that we ſhould bear with one another; he addeth further, that we do pardon one another; that is, efface out of our ſouls all reſentment of an offence received, and eradicate all deſire of revenge, heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to our neighbours,
<note place="margin">Mat. 18 35.</note> the fault they have committed againſt us; as our LORD enjoyns us, when he ſaith, that his Father will irremiſſibly puniſh us, if we do not from our hearts forgive every one his Brother. This duty reacheth univerſally to all the faithful, and takes place in all kind of ſubjects; as the Apoſtle ſignifies, when he adds indefinitely, if one, that is, any one of us, hath a quarrel againſt another; whatever the occaſion of the quarrel be, whether injurious ſpeeches given, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done, either againſt our ſelves, or any one of ours.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> was not ignorant how difficult this piece of Chriſtian piety is, our fleſh having no paſſion ſtronger, and more uneaſie to be ſubdued, than the reſentment of offences, and the deſire of revenge; to reduce us to this ſweetneſs and divine patience, and to beat down the fierceneſs of our hearts, he propoſeth unto us the example of the LORD JESUS, the Prince of our diſcipline, and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of our life; <hi>As CHRIST</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath pardoned you, ſo likewiſe do ye.</hi> He does the ſame alſo in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4.32.</note> where he ſets before us the example of GOD forgiving us all our ſins for his Son's ſake. And what ſtronger reaſon than this, could the Apoſtle alledge? For JESUS CHRIST being our Head, and our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, unto whoſe image we ought to be conformed, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Though he had not exerciſed it, but towards others; yet we ſhould be obliged to an imitation of Him. But it's our ſelves that he hath pardoned, and not others only; ſo that his example doth yet much the more ſtrictly bind us: For the inhumanity of that wretched ſervant in the Parable, who when he himſelf had been gratifi'd by his Maſter, would forgive his fellow nothing, is much more deteſtable, than if his Maſter had ſhew'd ſuch kindneſs only to ſome other man. Nor doth the Lord omit the noting of that circumſtance expreſly to him.
<note place="margin">Mat. 18.32, 33.</note> 
                        <hi>Wicked ſervant</hi> (ſaith he to him) <hi>I quitted thee all that debt; oughteſt not thou alſo to have had pity on thy ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſervant, as I had pity on thee?</hi> Judge then what an hell our obdurateneſs will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, if we, having experienced in our own perſons, the wonderful goodneſs of our LORD and Saviour mercifully forgiving us our faults, have hearts ſo refractory and ſo cruel, as to refuſe to forgive our Brethren. He is our Maſter and our GOD, and we are but his ſervants, and his vaſſals; or to ſay better, we were his enemies, his fugitives, and his rebels. And notwithſtanding all this, he forbore not to receive us to grace. Our faults were infinite for number, and extreamly hainous and criminal, as which being committed againſt GOD, deſerv'd eternal puniſhment: yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him not from pardoning them all. Think, if now our pride be not altogether intollerable, who being neither Gods, nor Kings, nor Rulers, but poor worms of the earth, and brands pluckt out of Hell, by the ſole clemency of our GOD, have yet the ſtoutneſs to deny, not our vaſſals, or our ſervants, but our neighbours, our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the domeſticks and children of our common Maſter, the pardon, not of many faults, but of one or two only? not of ſuch as are grievous, but of ſlight ones? not of capital ones, but ſuch as are remiſſible? yea ſometimes rather pretended, than real? Add hereto, in fine, that as for the LORD JESUS, no one pray'd him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us; there was nothing but his own goodneſs alone, that induc'd him to do us this grace. Whereas both He, and his Father, and his Spirit, do exhort us and command us, to forgive our Brethren; and this too, with promiſe, to render us for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50919:194"/>ever happy, if we do it; and threatning to condemn us to eternal fire, if we fail of it. Thus you ſee, how proper this example of our LORD is, for the Apoſtle's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and deſign.</p>
                     <p>But obſerve yet, in paſſing, that the compariſon he makes between our duty in this behalf, and the grace of JESUS CHRIST towards us, doth evidently infer, that the pardon of our ſins, which the LORD gives us, is pure and ſimple, and without reſervation of thoſe temporal puniſhments and ſatisfactions, which they of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend he doth exact of them, after he hath remitted them their faults. For as to us, it's clear, that as often as our Brother repents of having offended us, we ought to forgive him, according to the command of CHRIST; and he would be a mocker, and impious, who would not remit him his fault, but on condition that he were for ſome while puniſh'd for it in a fire. Since then the Apoſtle willeth, that we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our Brethren, as JESUS CHRIST forgiveth us, who ſeeth not, that this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of rigour, hath much leſs place in the grace we receive from our LORD, than in that we do our Brethren, by forgiving them, when they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended us.</p>
                     <p>This my beloved Brethren, is, what we had to ſay to you for expoſition of this Exhortation of the Apoſtle's. Would to GOD the practiſe of it were as common among us, as the underſtanding of it is eaſie, and the juſtneſs of it evident! But we know well, what he requireth of us, and are not ignorant, that it is our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will, neither can we deny but that it is moſt reaſonable; and yet we do it not. He commands us mercy, and kindneſs; and nothing is more rare among us. They are as little to be ſeen here, as in the ſocieties of the World. We have for the moſt part, little or no reſentment, of the miſeries of our neighbours: For if we were touched with a true compaſſion for them, we ſhould viſit them in their fickneſſes, we ſhould ſuccour them in their neceſſities, we ſhould aſſwage their griefs; at leaſt our tears would declare the part we take in their troubles; whereas we do, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh all of us, the contrary. We ſhun meeting the afilicted, as if miſery were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious malady; and to colour our hard-heartedneſs, we feign, that they are wicked, and have verily deſerv'd the evil, that they ſuffer. We inſult over their unhappineſs, ſo far are we from alleviating it; and inſtead of oyl, and balm, we pour vinegar into their wounds; not conſidering, that by adding calumny to rigour, we do not juſtifie, but redouble our cruelty: For though it were ſo, that the afflicted had been worſe, than you repreſent him; doth it follow, that you ought not to have pity on him? Do you owe compaſſion to none but the innocent? Good LORD! what would become of us, if GOD and men ſhould ſo deal with us? For who of us is not culpable? You that reproach the poor afflicted, unſeaſonably with their faults, in conſcience, are you pure, and without reproach before God? If you look narrowly into it, you will ſee, that if you be not miſerable 'tis not for that you have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, as well as any other, but for that GOD ſpares you, or reſerves you, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, for ſome harſher chaſtiſement. But it is uncertain too, whether the perſon, whom you treat ſo ill, be afflicted for the faults you accuſe him of, or no: For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the impenetrable depth of the judgments of GOD, no man can know of a truth, how the caſe is; and in the uncertainty we are, it is beſt to carry our ſelves wiſely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the man, and to judge moderately of his affliction. After all, the LORD hath not made you Inquiſitor, or Judge, of your Brethren, that you ſhould pity none, but thoſe whoſe innocency you ſhould juſtifie. He reſerves the examen of them to himſelf, and the authority to make it. For your part, who are an infirm man as others be, he gives you order only to conſider, whether your neighbours, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially your brethren, be afflicted; and if they be, to have pity on them; to ſeel their evils as ſenſibly as they themſelves; and after this firſt dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>But as we have little or no reſentment of the affairs of others; ſo have we too much for our own: Our private intereſt ſwalloweth up all the thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we have. We are ſollicitous for none but our ſelves, and thoſe hearts of ours,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50919:195"/>which ſee our Brethren pine away, and languiſh, and dye, without ſheeding ſo much as one tear, cannot endure the leaſt prick in our own skin, without perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being pierced through with grief. This delicateneſs makes us unable to bear any thing. The heavineſs, the ſimplicity, the leaſt defect we ſee in our people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, or in our friends, doth offend us. And though we have more need than any, of the equity, and indulgence of others, yet we can bear nothing from them, but imitating in this part of our lives, the furious and extravagant rigours of <hi>Rome</hi> in her Councils, do excommunicate and anathematize indifferently, all that croſſeth us. And as for the offences that are done us, we make them ſo hainous, that if we were believ'd, they would all be taken for treaſons, which cannot be pardon'd without injuſtice, and notable prejudice to all humane ſociety. Hence come thoſe hatreds and quarrels, wherewith all is full among us, and which are kept on foot, and perpetuated to the reproach of the Goſpel, and ſcandal of the world, between great and ſmall, yea, the more the ſorrow, between neighbours and neareſt alliances, not ſo much as Brethren and Siſters exempted; neither the communion of grace, nor of nature, being ſufficient to reduce our refractory and untr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ctable ſtoutneſs to reaſon. Now, though this be horrible, yet need it not be wondred at: For the cauſe of it is very evident, even pride, which hath taken up the place of that humility which the Apoſtle commandeth us. 'Tis this arrogancy, and that haughty opinion, which every one hath of himſelf, that renders us ſo cruel and unnatural, inſenſible of the miſeries of the afflicted, and implacable towards thoſe that have offended us. This is the poyſon that kills all ſweetneſs and gentleneſs, all tenderneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in us, and draws out of our bowels all the ſentiments of the charity of JESUS CHRIST. Reſtore humility, and you will ſoon recover all thoſe divine Vertues.</p>
                     <p>But, dear Brethren, enough of complaints; eſpecially on ſo good a day, in which we have communicatted at the LORD's own Table; I would now much rather praiſe your vertues and graces, than reprehend your faults and vices, I ſhall therefore leave the charge of examining them to each one of your ſelves, to be performed by you apart, under the eyes of GOD, and in the ſecret of your own conſciences; and will, for a concluſion, content my ſelf with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting and conjuring you to obey henceforth this command of the Apoſtle, and to put on (as he enjoyns) bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humility, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and patience, bearing with one another, and pardoning one another, if one hath a quarrel againſt the other, as CHRIST hath pardoned you. This is required of you, by that ſacred Bread and Wine, which you all have taken together this Morning, at the Table of JESUS CHRIST, and are the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of your union, and the badge of your concord. Hath not that myſtical Cup indeed ſweetned your hearts? Hath it not mitigated your gall and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs? and mollified your ſtoutneſs? and expel'd out of your minds, all thoughts contrary to charity? This again, that holy and glorious LORD calls for of you, who hath to day been communicated to you. Chriſtian, ſaith he, I have ſhewed thee mercy, that thou might'ſt ſo do to others; I have had pity upon thee, that thou might'ſt have compaſſion upon them; I have given thee my fleſh, and blood, that thou might'ſt impart of thy good things to my poor members, who need them; I have dy'd for thee, that thou might'ſt live for them; and have ſatisfied thee with the bread of Heaven, that thou might'ſt diſtribute unto them, that of the earth; I have pardoned thee thy crimes, and drowned them all in my blood, that thou might'ſt chearfully forgive them the offences they have done thee. Thus it is, my Brethren, that the LORD beſpeaks us.</p>
                     <p>The name of Chriſtians, which we bear, and the quality of elect of GOD, Saints and Beloved, which is inſeparably annext thereto, doth alſo oblige us to the ſame devoirs. For with what face can we ſay, that we are elected of GOD, if we ſtill abide in the commerce of the World, and its vices? Or his Saints, if we have no mark of his ſanctity? Or his Beloved, if we deſpiſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? In fine, the intereſt of our own welfare and ſalvation, demandeth too the ſame thing of us: For what is there more miſerable, than cruel, haughty,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50919:195"/>hard-hearted, and implacable ſouls? whom their own vices do torment night and day for the preſent; and the fire of Hell will torment eternally in the world to come? And on the contrary, what is more graceful or more happy, than a Church, in which do reign pity and benignity, humility, meekneſs and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience? And theſe holy vertues bind all the faithful together. It's there, that the LORD hath commanded life, and the bleſſing for ever,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 133.3.</note> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſings: It's there he pours forth the graces and conſolations of his Spirit du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this world, and will in the next, diſtribute the crowns of his Glory, and of his Immortality. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; Hypocriſie, that piece of wickedneſs, which GOD moſt abhorreth, hath a great extent in humane life. It not only counterfeiteth piety, doing external actions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and hiding a protane and impious heart under this handſome veil: but alſo frequently puts on a falſe thew of juſtneſs and goodneſs towards men; that by this out-ſide it may deceive them, and through their credulity, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh its unhoneſt, and vicious deſigns. Hereby, firſt, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits an iniquity of blackeſt note; it being, as a wiſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſometime ſaid, one of the unjuſteſt things in the world, to make a wicked wretch paſs for an honeſt man. And ſecondly, it does unworthily profane the acts of vertue, as holy, and ſacred a thing as any is, making them ſerve the paſſions and intereſts of vice, than which a more unclean and baſer object cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. For an Hypocrite does good, not out of any affection he hath unto vertue; but to get reputation, or win peoples hearts, or advance his own affairs. Ambition, or avarice, or pleaſure, is the idol, to which he ſacrificeth the nobleſt, and moſt ſplendid actions. For inſtance, when he gives alms unto the poor, 'tis not, for that he careth for them, as the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>Judas;</hi> but he doth it only to win credit. He gives properly to his own vanity, and not to the neceſſitouſneſs of men. Again, when he acts the part of a merciful man, and forgives thoſe that have croſs'd him, the offences they have done him; it is not any ſentiment of goodneſs, but meerly the intereſt of his glory, that ſways him ſo to do. There are a multitude of people that do thus abuſe beneficence, and gentleneſs. As the more expert ſort
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50919:196"/>of Tyrants, they make 'em inſtruments of their luſt; and when they perform any actions of 'em, it is not at the command of thoſe vertues themſelves; but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to their own vices; retaining a diſpoſition to be cruel, and inhumane, if their intereſt requireth it. Such as are not vertuous but after this manner, are not ſo indeed. They are ſubtil, and dextrous; but not good men. And though the external luſtre of theſe goodly works they do, be apt to deceive men; yet it will not be able to ſatisfie their own conſcience, if they have any; and much leſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the eyes of GOD, who judgeth of things by their in-ſide, and their verity; not by their apparence. For that any act of beneficence, of clemency, of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and humanity, may be holy and acceptable unto GOD, 'tis requiſite it ſhould proceed from a ſincere love towards our neighbours. If it come from any other principle, it is of no value in reality, how plauſible and pompous ſoever it be in ſhew. It's a falſe and ſpurious production; a fruit ſair without, but worm-eaten, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt within. Beſide that the thing ſpeaks of its ſelf, St. <hi>Paul</hi> proclaims it, in the thirteenth Chapter of the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians. If I diſtribute all my goods</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to feed the poor, and have not charity, it profits me nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore, Brethren, the ſame Apoſtle, having here afore charged us to bear with one another, to pardon one another, and to perform all other acts of kindneſs, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, meekneſſe, and patience, doth now add very pertinently for the purging of our hearts and works from all the venome of hypocriſie, that together with theſe vertues, which he hath exhorted us unto, we have, above all, charity, as that which is the ſoul of every true vertue: and without which, the faireſt, and moſt eſteemed actions, are but, as an ancient Doctor ſaid well, glittering ſins. <hi>And beſide all this,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>put on charity, which is the bond of perfection. And let the peace of GOD hold the chief place in your hearts, unto which ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</hi> You plainly ſee, that he recommends unto us three Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, <hi>Charity, the Peace of GOD, and Thankfulneſs.</hi> Now as for the laſt of theſe, he only names it, without ſaying ought elſe of it; whereas in referrence to the other two, he briefly ſets before us ſome conſiderations, that may oblige us to take up the ſtudious purſuance of them. For he ſaith of charity, that <hi>it is the bond of Perfection; and of the Peace of GOD, that we are thereunto called in one body.</hi> In compliance then with the order of our Text, we will treat of three heads in this action, if GOD pleaſe; firſt of Charity; ſecondly, of the Peace of GOD; and then for a concluſion, in ſome brief touches of gratitude, or thankfulneſs; about which the Apoſtle ſpeaks but a word, and no more.</p>
                     <p>There is no perſon in the Church, but knows, that Charity is that pure, and ſincere, and vertuous love, which each of us doth owe to other men our neighbours, upon the account of that communion of nature we have with them, as alſo principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the image of GOD, after which they all are created, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe command that He hath given us, to love them as our ſelves. I grant, it hath divers degrees, and doth embrace men with ſome inequality, theſe more ſtrictly, and thoſe leſs, according to the differences of their merit and worth, as alſo of the union we have with them, either in nature, or in the ſtate, or in grace. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it extends its ſelf unto all, and doth not account any one a ſtranger; but obligeth, and ſerveth them freely, as far as its ability permits, and when occaſion is offered. For our LORD and Saviour teacheth us, in the parable of that poor man, whom the <hi>Samaritan</hi> aſſiſted,
<note place="margin">Luke 12.36.</note> finding him in that pitiful eſtate the theeves had left him, on the way from <hi>Jericho</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that every man that needeth our help, is our neighbour; So that GOD, and right reaſon obliging us to love whom ever that is our neighbour, it's out of all doubt, that there is no man but we ought to love. But as Charity hath a much greater extent than the friendſhip of the world; ſo is its flame much more pure and holy. For to ſay true, men of the world love none but themſelves; it being evident, that if they affect any, it is not ſo much to do them good, as to draw profit or pleaſure from them. But Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth ſincerely affect its neighbour, deſiring to him, and procuring him that good which is neceſſary to make him happy. And the difference of theſe two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections comes from their cauſes. For Charity iſſueth from the love of GOD; whereas worldly friendſhip proceeds from that vicious, and inordinate love which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50919:197"/>every one beareth to himſelf; ſo as Charity loving our neighbour for GOD's ſake, ſeeks nothing but GOD's glory, and the welfare of the perſon it loveth: whereas a man of the world, not loving but for his own ſake, does accordingly ſeek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his own intereſts. And though this doth plainly appear in the whole conduct of the one and the other of theſe loves, yet it may be particularly obſerved in this one event, namely, that that affliction and miſery which extinguiſheth world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amity, doth make the affections of charity to flame more than ever; an evident ſign, that the one is neither bred, nor fed, but by the fruit it gathers from the thing it loves; whereas the other, on the contrary, being kindled by that ray of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine image, which it ſees ingraven on the nature of its neighbour, is kept alwaies in, and the more it ſees him need its compaſſions, and good offices, the more it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, and redoubleth its endeavours. It's this holy, and Chriſtian Charity, which the Apoſtle would have us put on. <hi>And beſides all this,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>put on Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words, as they lye in the original, may be taken two manner of waies, both of them apt, and good, and ſuch as have their authors. Some interpret them, and above, or over all theſe things. Others, a little otherwiſe, and for all theſe things. Both the one, and the others, do accord, that all thoſe things which the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, are the ſame he had ſpoken of immediately before; to wit, thoſe bowels of mercy, that kindneſs, that humility, meekneſs, and patience, which, in the precedent verſes, he commands us to put on. Now then, after the ſenſe of the former of thoſe interpreters, he means that to this rich garment, we ſhould add charity: put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it uppermoſt, as a precious, and an uſeful robe, to cover, and keep all the reſt. Not that we muſt put on charity laſt, in regard of time, after all thoſe other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: for on the contrary, it ought to be firſt formed in us, as the parent, of whom the moſt part of the reſt are to be brought forth. But the Apoſtle makes uſe of this compariſon, upon the account of other reſemblances that theſe things have with one another; and the authors of this expoſition do note three of that kind; One, that as the robe we put over our clothes, is greater and larger than our other clothing, ſo charity hath by much a greater extent than any of the fore-mentioned vertues. For whereas Mercy does but ſuccour the miſerable; Kindneſs, but help them that have need or us; Sweetneſs, but careſs thoſe with whom we converſe; and Patience, but bear with thoſe that offend us; charity embraceth them altogether, and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate towards our neighbours generally, both thoſe that are in adverſity, and ſuch as are in proſperity; perſons accommodated, as well as thoſe that are neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous; friends, and foes; the perfect, and the infirm; thoſe that oblige us, and thoſe that offend us; and thoſe likewiſe that look upon us as indifferent. Secondly, as that laſt piece of our clothing, which alſo covers all the reſt, and is moſt in ſight, is commonly faireſt, and the richeſt; ſo likewiſe is Charity, without doubt, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than all the other Vertues, which make up a Chriſtian's clothing. Laſtly, as the one doth mark out, and diſtinguiſh men, being uſually the character of their rank, and of their quality in the Town, or in the State: ſo the other is the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans livery, and a mark of the honour they have to be the children of GOD, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his Son:
<note place="margin">Joh. 13.35.</note> as our Saviour ſaid; <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if ye love one another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations are pretty, and pleaſing; But I doubt whether they be not over-ſine, and ſomething too far fetch'd. I ſhould rather ſay, that the Apoſtle, by thoſe words of his, <hi>And above all theſe things put on Charity,</hi> doth purely, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mean, that above all, that is principally, we be owners of Charity; ſignifying to us thereby, as he elſe-where teacheth us at large, that it's the excellenteſt of all Chriſtian Vertues; to that degree, that all the reſt do remain uſeleſs without it, being but ſo many vain, and fallacious pictures, which have nothing of ſirnmeſſe, or ſolidity in them. For inſtance; Mercy without Charity, is but a weakneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Without it kindneſs, or benignity, is but indiſcreet profuſion. Courteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but deceitful tattle; Humility, low ſpiritedneſſe; and Patience, a ſtupidity. It's the Divine ſire of Charity, that animateth all theſe Vertues, and maketh them perfect, and gives them all the nobleneſſe, and acceptableneſſe to GOD, they have. It's with good reaſon therefore, that after the Apoſtle had recommended them to us,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50919:197"/>he adds, that above all we have charity, as that which is of all the richeſt, and moſt excellent.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 23.</note> Not to ſpeak here of the advantage he elſe-where gives it above all other parts of Chriſtianity; even to the preferring it, not only before the gift of tongues, and miracles, before the grace of propheſie, and all the other mervails, where-with JESUS CHRIST adorned the beginnings of His Church; but even before Faith, and Hope; as that which will endure for ever, and flouriſh in the very ſanctuary of immortality; whereas all thoſe other gifts of GOD, which have their exerciſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here beneath, ſhall ceaſe; whence he concludes, that Charity is greater than all thoſe other graces.</p>
                     <p>The other Expoſition, which interprets theſe words of St. <hi>Paul, And for all theſe things put on Charity,</hi> is alſo very pertinent, and what we have been ſaying, doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently explain the ſenſe of it. For ſince Charity is the ſoul, and the perfection of all the ſore-named Vertues, which gives them all the valuableneſs and worth they have, the acts of them being vain without Charity, as the Apoſtle ſays, it is clear, that for the having poſſeſſion of them, Charity muſt be had. Beſide, 'tis it that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth, and ſett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th them on work: as alſo that, with a kind of neceſſity, produceth, and formeth them in our ſouls. For it is not poſtible, but that the man that truly loves his neighbour, ſhould be ſenſible of his diſtreſſes, if he be afflicted; gratifie him with his beneficence, if he needs it; ſtoop to his neceſſities, and humble himſelf about him; bear with his defects, if he diſcover any; treat him kindly; condeſcend to his infirmities, and ſeek to him, if he withdraw from his friendſhip, and patiently take his offences, if he ſo far forget himſelf, as to do him any; according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's ſaying, that <hi>Charity is patient, and kind, not envious, nor inſolent;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 7. Rom. 13.9, 10.</note> that <hi>it is not puffed up;</hi> that <hi>it endureth all things, believeth all things, beareth all things.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he affirms elſe-where, that <hi>He that loveth others, hath fulfilled the law;</hi> and that this command, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> doth comprehend in it, and ſammarily re-capitulate all the duties injoyned in the reſt of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and concludes, that Charity is the fulneſſe of the Law, that is, the thing that filleth up all the articles of it. Hence it comes, that St. <hi>John,</hi> the LORD JESUS His beloved diſciple, as we read in the Church-hiſtory, in his extreme old age, having no longer the ſtrength, as afore-time, to make large Sermons in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the faithful, contented himſelf to ſay th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Since then the nature, and ſecondity, and efficacy of Charity is ſuch, you ſee how great reaſon the Apoſtle had to recommend unto us the putting of it on, for our having, and exerciſing that mercy, benignity, humility, meekneſs, and patience, he told us of afore.</p>
                     <p>His adding, that <hi>Charity is the bond of perfection,</hi> hath the ſame tendency; But here it comes into queſtion, what that perfection is, which Charity is the bond of; and Expoſitors do labour to explain it to us; Some underſtand it of the perfection of all vertues; which this one doth bind, and put together, comprehending, and embracing them all, as we ſaid even now; and the Romaniſts do thence draw an argument, to conſirm their doctrine of juſtification by works. For, ſay they, thoſe that perfectly fulfill the law, are juſtified by the works of the law. Now, ſince Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is, in this ſenſe, the bond of perfection, it is evident, that ſuch as have true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, do perfectly fulfill the law; whence it follows, that they are juſtified by the works of the law. But letting paſs for the preſent, that which they preſuppoſe, namely, that Charity is here called, the bond of perfection, becauſe it bindeth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and comprehendeth in it the obſervation of all the commandments of the law; it is clear however, that that which they pretend will not follow. Firſt, becauſe it is not ſufficient for a mans being juſtified by the works of the law, that he fulfills it after ſome certain time unto his life's end. 'Tis neceſſary he ſhould have fulfill'd it from the beginning, and been exempt of ſin, not only from his childhood, and youth, as that juſticiary ſays in the Goſpel, but even from his nativity; ſuppoſing then, but not granting, that he that hath Charity, doth perfectly fulfill the Law, without failing in ſo much as one point; this, as you ſee, would have place in him, but from the time he had put on the habit of Charity; and could not hinder, but that he might have tranſgreſſed divers waies before. Since then the law juſtifyeth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50919:198"/>none but thoſe that never violated it, at any time what-ever; it is manifeſt, that though a Chriſtian ſhould never violate the law after he hath Charity; yet could he not be juſtified by his works; nor would he be exempted from needing the grace of GOD, for the remiſſion of the ſins he committed before he had Charity. But where grace is,
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.6.</note> there juſtification by works cannot have place, according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans. If it be by grace, it is no more by works. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe grace is no more grace: but if it be by works, it is no more by grace. Otherwiſe work is no more work.</hi> But I add, in the ſecond place, that what they do ſuppoſe, to wit, that he that hath Charity, does perfectly fulfill the law, and ſo, as never to fail ſo much as in one point, that this, I ſay moreover, is evidently falſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto experience, and unto Scripture. Unto experience; for who but daily ſees, and perceives how often, &amp; how many waies thoſe very men among the faithful do offend, who have greateſt degrees of Charity?
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.</note> Unto Scripture; for it plainly telleth us in divers places, that <hi>if we ſay</hi> (they are the words of an Apoſtle) <hi>we have no ſin, we lye, and the truth is not in us.</hi> True it is, that Charity doth not cauſe us to offend; nay, ſuch offending is, on the contrary, a deviation, and a departure from Charity. However, I affirm, it is no impoſſibility, but that a man that hath true Charity, may ſometime falter in it, as you ſee it often comes to paſs in all habits; he that's endowed with them, doth ſome actions not very conſonant unto them. A good Archer, for inſtance, doth not alwaies hit the white, and a good Advocate doth not alwaies plead exactly well. It befalls the beſt Writers, and the exquiſiteſt Painters, and the moſt accompliſhed Politicians, to commit errors now and then in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their profeſſion. And it was ſaid long ſince, of the excellenteſt, and moſt admired piece of heathen Poetry, that there are paſſages in it, at which the author ſlept: from whence others have deriv'd the priviledge, that in a prolix work they may ſometimes forget themſelves. The ſame event attends the habitudes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertues; for neither do theſe ſo abſolutely fill up the ſouls of men, but that actions, contrary to them, do ſometimes eſcape thoſe who have obtained them to an hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> degree: as experience ſhews; and Philoſophers have expreſly noted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither are faults incompatible with the habit of Charity, as we poſſeſſe it here beneath. Only it with-holdeth ſuch as are truly endowed with it, from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them often; and when they are overtaken, it eftſoons toucheth them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret at it, and moves them to repent of what they have committed. Since then, that to be juſtified by works, a man muſt preſent ſuch ones unto GOD, as have no way any need of pardon, it is ſtill evident, that Charity, how accompliſhed ſoever we may have it here below, yet is not capable of juſtiſying us before GOD. If our adverſaries will be obſtinate, and maintain that Charity is exempted from all ſin, I will grant it them, of that Charity, which reigneth on high in the Heavens, being kindled,
<note place="margin">Aug. Ep. 29. ad Hieron.</note> and kept up by the viſion of the glorious face of GOD: but I will ſay with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that no man hath ſuch a Charity upon earth: ours here is but begun, and imperſectly formed. Yet the Law requireth of us a Charity full, and entire, and perfect in every particular. Surely then, that which we for preſent have, is not able to ſatisfie the Law, nor by conſequence, juſtifie us.</p>
                     <p>But others conceive, that by this perfection, which Charity is the bond of, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and unity of the Church is to be underſtood: for that the perfection of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies doth properly conſiſt in the collection and colligation of the parts whereof they are compos'd; thoſe that want any one of them, being not in a condition to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led perfect. Theſe authors therefore make account, that Charity is here ſtil'd, the bond of perfection; becauſe 'tis it that joyneth, and bindeth all the faithful toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by means of the mutual love they bear to one another. For my part, Dear Brethren, I think we muſt joyn together theſe two expoſitions, and reduce them to one; for this end, taking the Apoſtle's words, the bond of perfection, as ſimply importing, that Charity is a perfect bond, by an Hebraiſm very frequent through the whole Scripture; as when 'tis ſaid a man of ſin, or a man of peace, to ſignifie a ſinful man,
<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.26.</note> or one that's peaceable, or pacifick; affections of infamy, for infamous affections: and ſo in a multitude of other places. Here then, in like manner, the Apoſtle ſays, a bond of perfection, inſtead of a perfect bond, an exquiſite bond, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of binding up in perfection both all Chriſtian Vertues in every faithful ſoul,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50919:198"/>and all the faithful in the Church with one another. For as concerning Vertues, Charity binds them together; both by that common principle, whence it cauſeth them to ſpring, to wit, love of our neighbour; and by that common end, unto which it directeth them, namely, his benefit, and edification; It gathers up, and puts all of them together in its boſome, not leaving one out of its encloſure, becauſe they are all neceſſary for it; mercy to comfort thoſe whom it loves; benignity to ſuccour them; humility to win them; gentleneſſe to pleaſe them; patience to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them; and in fine, all the reſt, to acquit it ſelf of thoſe duties it would do them. And as for the faithful, who knows not, that Charity is the perfect bond of their union? The conſiderations of blood, of ſtate, of intereſt, and of pleaſure, do ſometimes bind other men together; but it is with a great deal of imperfection; theſe unſure bonds being daily broken; and ſo badly compacting the perſons they incloſe, that they are ſoon ſeparated, and do ſometimes even fall foul with, and rend one another. But Charity is in very deed, a perfect bond, that uniteth thoſe whom it ties together, ſo cloſe, and with ſuch firmneſſe, as neither the accidents of fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ne, (as they call them) nor the mutations of the earth, nor death it ſelf, which ruines all other unions and conjunctions in the World, can looſen them, or ſeparate them from one another. It was this ſacred bond, that heretofore made all the beleevers at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be of one heart, and of one ſoul. It's a bond,
<note place="margin">Acts 4.32.</note> that all the force of men and elements can neither break nor untye; a bond ſtronger than death, and the grave, as the myſtical Spouſe ſings in that excellent Song. It doth not only joyn the ſouls of the faithful; it mingleth, and conſociates them, changeth them into one body, and one ſpirit; gives them the ſame will, and the ſame affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>Now ſurther, it is to form and conſerve this holy union among us, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle does recommend to us the peace of GOD, in the ſecond part of this Text. <hi>Let the peace of GOD,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hold the firſt place in your hearts, to the which you are called in one body.</hi> For this peace of GOD, is not that which we have with GOD, by faith in JESUS CHRIST His Son; when as being appeaſed by the ſatisfaction of His Croſſe, He looks upon us in Him with a propitions, and favourable eye, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not as a Judge, not imputing our ſins to us, which may be termed, Peace of conſcience. But it is the peace we ought to have with one another, all of us living amiably together, as children of one and the ſame Father, and heirs of one and the ſame grace and glory. It's the daughter of Charity, and a fruit of that holy and Chriſtian love which binds us perfectly together. The Apoſtle calls it <hi>the peace of GOD;</hi> firſt, becauſe He loves it above all things, and upon this account is often ſtil'd in the Scriptures, <hi>the GOD of peace;</hi> hating nothing in the world more than trouble, and diſcord, and contentions, and wars. Secondly, becauſe He commands it us every where in His word. And laſtly, becauſe He is the Author of it, who gives it, and inſpires it, by His Spirit, into all thoſe that are truly His children. And the Apoſtle hath expreſly given it this title in this place, for the more effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending of it to us, and that He might induce us to receive it with the greater reſpect, as a thing of GOD's holy, ſacred, and divine, which we cannot violate without offending grievouſly that Soveraign Majeſty to whom it doth belong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> many waies.</p>
                     <p>He willeth, that this Peace of GOD do hold the chief place in our hearts; The term he makes uſe of in the original is admirably expreſſive, and elegant; for it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies, to have the ſuper-intendance of a thing; to be the judge, and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it; to govern, and regulate it, and give it law. That is, the Apoſtle means, that this Divine peace be the Queen of our hearts; the miſtreſſe and governeſſe of all your motions; that that keeps them in due reſpect, and with-holds them from ever attempting ought that tendeth to violate, or diſturb it. And if the reſenting of an offence, for inſtance, or an opinion of our own worth, or any other ſuch conſideration, do begin to kindle wrath, or hatred, or animoſity againſt our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, or excite ſome other paſſion of like nature in our hearts, that this Peace do forthwith advance, and ſtay the commotion and agitation of our minds, calming the ſtorm, and ſpeedily repelling all theſe ſentiments of the fleſh, as ſo many incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, or evil ſpirits, without giving them entrance, or audience. That it do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50919:199"/>us, and inſpire into us humility, and patience, when we have been offended; regret, and the making of ſatisfaction, when we have offended any other: and cauſe us to ſeek carefully after all that it ſhall judge neceſſary to maintain amity, and good intelligence among us, as kind words and obliging deeds; baniſhing both from our mouths, and from our manners, all that's apt to cauſe, or keep up, our dividing from our neighbours.</p>
                     <p>The advertiſing of us, that this is the peace of GOD, were enough to perſwade us to give it ſuch place in our hearts. But that the Apoſtle might overcome all poſſible obſtinacy, he here further repreſents unto us two conſiderations beſides, which oblige us to give it this ſuper-intendency over our ſouls. The one is, that we are thereunto called; and the other, that we are one body. For the firſt, you know that our LORD and Maſter JESUS CHRIST, doth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where call us to this Peace of GOD, and that He hath given us precepts for it in His Goſpel, and examples of it in His life. For what was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the world more meek and peaceable, than this Divine Lamb? He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not,
<note place="margin">Mat. 12.19.</note> nor cryed, <hi>and His voice was not heard in the ſtreets;</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets fore-told of Him. He was gentle, and lowly in heart. He never repulſed any; and received ſinners with open arms, how bad and abominable ſoever they had been. He invited His greateſt enemies unto His ſalvation, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered His grace to the moſt obſtinate, and bore their contradictions without anſwering again, and their reproaches with ſilence, and their rage without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperation; and did weep bitterly for that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that rebellious City would not know the things of her peace. Such is the pattern He gave us; command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us likewiſe expreſly to <hi>be ſweet,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mark 9.50.</note> 
                        <hi>and ſimple as doves, without gall, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bitterneſſe, and to be in peace among our ſelves.</hi> And His Apoſtles repeat this leſſon to us in divers places,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.8.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> here, and other-where again. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as in you lyeth, have peace with all men. And it's for this that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST came into the world, even to pacifie Heaven and Earth, Jews and Gentiles;</hi>

Since He forms them to it by His voice, by His liſe, by His promiſes, and by the whole deſign of His Mediatorial Office?</p>
                     <p>But beſides the command and order He hath given, the very eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition He hath by His vocation put us in, doth manifeſtly oblige us thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and this the Apoſtle repreſents unto us in the ſecond place, when having told us, that we are called unto peace, he adds, in one body, or to expreſs the full and whole force of the Greek words, in one only body. It's a doctrine univerſally received, and moſt expreſly aſſerted in divers places of Scripture, that the whole Church doth make up but one only myſtical body, of which JESUS CHRIST is the head, and the faithful are the members, being animated under Him with one and the ſame ſpirit, and knit together by one and the ſame Faith, Hope, and Charity. No one hath part in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who lives not in the communion of this body. Sure then it's one of our greateſt concernments to maintain peace among our ſelves; and to put it, as the Apoſtle gives us order, in the higheſt place of our hearts, that it may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern with ſupremacy all our thoughts, all our motions, and ſentiments. For there are no natural bodies, but their members do conſpire, and live with one another in a perpetual and inviolable peace. The ſocieties of States and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which are bodies, but of another kind, namely, political and oeconomical
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50919:199"/>are governed in the ſame manner; their primary and moſt ſacred law is, that all the orders and perſons of which they are compos'd, have peace with one another. Now if this hath place both in nature, and in the ſocieties of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; how much more ought it to be obſerv'd in the Church, which is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, a coeleſtial and ſupernatural body? Our own intereſt doth naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; For as war doth weaken and ruine the States into which it thruſts its ſelf, and whoſe members it divideth; ſo on the contrary, Peace eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, fortifieth, and conſerves them, according to that ſaying of our Saviour,

And I acknowledge the argumentation is good, and pertinent. Yet it is better to take this clauſe for an exhortation, he maketh us in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to be thankful towards GOD, and towards men. For, as ingratitude is one of the blackeſt, and moſt deteſtable vices, expreſly enrolled by the Apoſtle among the marks of thoſe wretched times, whoſe extreme corruption he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells in the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy;</hi> ſo is it ſure, that gratitude,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.2.</note> or thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, is a vertue moſt neceſſary of any: and in my opinion, he went not very wide from the truth, who called it the mother of all other vertues.

                     <p>Dear Brethren, Theſe are the three Vertues which he tells us of in this Text. Let us not neglect any one of them. But embrace them all three, and deck our lives internally and externally with them. In the firſt place, above all let us put on Charity; as the ſoul of Chriſtianity, the perfect bond of your union, the mark of GOD's children, the abridgement of all our duties, and the mother of all Vertues. Having it, you have all; and without it, you have nothing. Without it, all the profeſſion you make of the Goſpel, your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, your religion, and your ſervices, are but an empty noiſe, <hi>a ſounding braſs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1.</note> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>and a tinkling cymbal.</hi> Becauſe the Iſraelites wanted this, GOD had all their devotions, and all their ſacrifices in abomination. How much more will He reject yours, if you have the impudence to preſent Him any without Charity? Now that His Son JESUS hath ſo magnifically diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to you the neceſſity and excellency of it? For what can you alledge any longer, for excuſing your ſelves from this duty? Nature it ſelf, verily, ſufficiently obliged you afore to love your neighbours, ſince that they are your brethren, even after the fleſh, iſſued from the ſame <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Noah,</hi> animated by the ſame Spirit, clothed with the ſame body, born and bred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame earth; and if you deveſt your ſelves of all the difference that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and opinion hath created, you will ſee, that in truth there is none at all between you and them. You are ſubject to the ſame accidents they are; and the death that at laſt brings them down, will no more ſpare you than it does them. Having ſo ſtrict a conjunction with them, you ought to look upon them as your other ſelves, and love them as your neer relations, and not account any thing that betides them, forein, or indifferent. The Heathen, who knew no more, had the underſtanding to draw this concluſion from it. But the Croſs of our LORD and Saviour hath diſcovered to us other reaſons of Charity, that are much more excellent, and much more
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50919:200"/>preſſing. For He ſo loved men, that He died to ſave them. Chriſtian, how can you hate or deſpiſe perſons whom your Maſter hath ſo much loved and eſteem'd? upon whom you ſee His blood, whereby they have been waſh'd and purified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with your ſelves? His Spirit, with which they have been ſealed as well as you? The firſt-fruits, and earneſts of that heavenly inheritance unto which they and you are called to live eternally together in the ſame? It's by that they are to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not by what they are upon this earth, which with the whole heap of all its pomps, and riches, and nobility, and honours, and other pieces of vanity, is but a figure that paſſeth away, and periſheth. If your neighbour hath nothing on the earth; if he be deſpiſed, and accounted the filth and off-ſcouring of the world, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, remember, that he hath his ſhare in Heaven, that he is an heir of this eternal Kingdom, the child of GOD, and brother of JESUS CHRIST. Let this dignity of his, which is ſo high, and ſo precious in the ſight of GOD and His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, induce you to love him, to tender him, and apply your ſelf to him; let it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate your reſentments, if he hath offended you; let it ſtretch for your hands to a ready communicating of the ſuccour of your alms, of your conſolations, and of your good offices, if any neceſſity of his does call for them. For ſuch is the nature of true Charity; it loves not in word, and with the tongue, but indeed, and in truth. Let ours then abound in alms, and in beneficence unto the poor; in conſolations of, and in good offices to the afflicted. Let it be firm and conſtant. Let not our brethrens ill ſucceſſes no, nor their offences if it befall them to do us any) be ever able to break this ſacred bond of perfectneſſe, which ſpiritually joyneth us and them together in our LORD.</p>
                     <p>Let us alſo heedfully keep, as committed to our truſt, that peace which JESUS CHRIST hath let us at His death, and unto which He calleth us in one body, by all His religious myſteries. This, ſaith the Apoſtle, is the peace of GOD: and he that keeps it, may be ſure to have GOD with him, according to the promiſe which the ſame Apoſtle does elſe-where make us. <hi>Live in peace,</hi> (ſaith he to us) <hi>and the GOD of love, and of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> Object not thoſe petty reaſons which fleſh and blood inſpires. Nothing muſt be heard againſt the Peace of GOD. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle requires that it have the prime place in our hearts; that it be the Governeſſe, and Super-intendant of them. Account then every thought that would diſturb it, as rebellious, drive it out of your hearts, and cruſh it as an infernal thought, which cannot come but from the enemie, ſince it is contrary to the peace of CHRIST. Now here, Dear Brethren, I might make large complaints upon that rebelling, whereof the moſt of us are guilty, againſt this Peace of GOD, which the Apoſtle ſets up to rule in our hearts. We have ſhaken off its yoke. Fleſh and blood, and their intereſts have driven it out from among us. It is ſo far from poſſeſſing the firſt place here, that it hath ſcarce any at all: and it ſeems, that offended with our contempt, it hath quitted the Church as well as the world, and is altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into Heaven. For all among us is full of diviſions, and diſcord, of ſuits, of quarrels, of little wars, which we make upon one another, with a ſcandalous eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obſtinacy. In the name of GOD, let us recall, Beloved Brethren, into our communion, this holy and bleſſed Peace of GOD, unto which JESUS CHRIST and His Goſpel, with ſo much inſtance invite us, and henceforth give it that place in our hearts which the Apoſtle aſſigneth it. This is the beſt thanks we can render this great Saviour for the kindneſſe He hath ſhewed us. And if we deny Him that peace He demands of us for our Brethren, I know not how we can ask of Him His, for our ſelves; or clear our ſelves of the fowleſt ingratitude that ever was. But I hope better things, and do beſeech the LORD, that Himſelf would ſhed abroad His peace into our hearts, and abſolutely ſettle it in them: that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we may ſee all His bleſſings abound in the midſt of us, both thoſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, and thoſe of the life to come. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; Experience ſheweth us, that moſt things are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by uſage of the ſame means that gave them being. Thus in nature, we ſee that nothing doth more confirm, nor better conſerve the habits of Arts and Sciences, than thoſe very actions and exerciſes which ſormed them, and that nothing doth better maintain Eſtates, than the ſame prudence and valour that raiſed them: Alſo, as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the converſe of vertuous perſons: doth commonly enkincle in our hearts a love of, and an aim at probity; So do's it advance our conſtant perſevering in the ſame. Semblably in Religion, the Word of GOD, which produceth faith and holineſs in our Souls, is the very thing that conſerves and perpetuates it there. This Word is the power of GOD, both to form the piety of His Elect at firſt, and to keep it in them for ever, after it is formed; It is both the Parent, and the Nurſe, and Gardienne of the new man. It adminiſtreth, both the ſeed of our Regeneration, and the milk of our ſpiritual nutrition. 'Tis it that gives us ſpiritual life; 'tis it, that conſerves the ſame. 'Tis upon it, that both the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and the progreſſions; both the production, and the perſeverance thereof do depend. Wherefore the Holy Apoſtle, having afore exhorted the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> unto Chriſtian Sanctification, and pointed at the principal pieces of it, as mercy, benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, patience, charity, and peace; now to abridge this diſcourſe, and compriſe all in few words, does recommend to them the Word of GOD; as the only means, not only to maintain and conſerve, but even to perfit and compleat all the parts of their piety; as a living and a plentiful ſpring, whence they might draw both thoſe vertues which he had nominated, and all others that were neceſſary for the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50919:201"/>of their Chriſtianity. There is no need, (ſaith he) I ſhould take the pains to reckon up particularly to you all the graces that ought to beam forth in your actions, nor recommend one by one each of thoſe perfections which the name and profeſſion of JESUS CHRIST obligeth you unto. You have a good Maſter near you, that will teach you them, and excellently form them in you; I mean, The word of CHRIST, which I count it ſufficient for me to recommend to you. Hear it, and practice it, and let it be familiar with you. To direct you to it, is to ſay all. You will want nothing, if you hear, and ſtudy, and believe its intimations, with that heedfulneſs and reſpect you owe it. <hi>Let it dwell richly in you in all wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This is the advice, Beloved Brethren, that the Apoſtle heretofore gave the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> Advice, ſo much the more neceſſary for us now; becauſe beſide the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and diſguſt of our nature, there are people found in this unhappy age, who decry the Word of GOD, and do all they can to make Chriſtians ſuſpect it, and to wreſt out of their hands this precious treaſure of faithful Souls. An attempt unheard of in all the firſt ages of the Church, and not to be believ'd, did not our eyes and ſenſes teſtifie of it? Therefore if you have any zeal for your Maſters Glory, upon whoſe wiſdom all the blame that is laid upon His word, doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently reflect; if you have any charity for the edification of your Neighbours; in fine, if you have any affection for your own Salvation, Chriſtians, hear with attention the Apoſtle's inſtruction. Take home to you, and keep with you this Heavenly Word which he would lodge and have to dwell there. Defend theſe Divine ſprings of life, which all our Fathers drank of, againſt the injuriouſneſs of theſe new Doctors, who would by all means ſtop and fill them up; doing the Houſe of JESUS CHRIST ſuch wrong as the Philiſtines ſometime did the Family of <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 26.15:</note> whoſe Wells they clos'd up and fill'd with earth, to render them uſeleſs; as the Sacred Story telleth us. Now to guide you in this Meditation, I will (if pleaſe GOD) conſider in order, the two parts that offer themſelves in the Apoſtles Text; Firſt, that wherein he recommends unto us the ſtudying of the Word of GOD in theſe terms, <hi>Let the Word of CHRIST dwell in you richly in all Wiſdom.</hi> Secondly, that, wherein he repreſents to us ſome of the principal uſes we ought to make of it, <hi>Ye teaching</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and admoniſhing one another in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, ſinging from your heart unto the LORD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the terms he uſeth in the firſt part, are worthy of not a little conſideration. Firſt, his calling the Word of GOD which was deliver'd by the Prophets and Apoſtles, and is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, <hi>the Word of CHRIST.</hi> The Word of CHRIST, both becauſe He is the ſubject and the end of it; as alſo for that He is the Author of it, who inſpir'd it by His Spirit into His ſervants; in the ſame manner, as the Apoſtle elſewhere termeth all the afflictions of the new and of the ancient Church,
<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> even to thoſe which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Iſraelites ſuffered in <hi>Egypt, the afflictions and reproach of CHRIST;</hi> becauſe CHRIST is both the cauſe for which the faithful are afflicted, and alſo the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of their afflictions, who ſends 'em them, and governs them by His Providence. Whence it clearly follows that He is GOD, ſince all Scripture is by inſpiration of GOD; and that He did ſubſiſt in the time of the Patriarchs, and of all the ancient Church; againſt the impiety of thoſe Hereticks who deny the Divinity of our LORD, and pretend that He had no ſubſiſtence in Nature until He was born of the Bleſſed Virgin.</p>
                     <p>Further in the next place, we are to weigh in what manner the Apoſtle recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends unto us the ſtudy of this Word. He ſaith not, Let it be among you, let it be read, let it be known of you; but uſing a term of much more force and efficacy than all that amounts unto; he willeth that this Word of CHRIST do dwell in us. Dwelling, you know, is properly affirmed of men, and doth import their making their abode in this or that place their living, and being ordinarily and almoſt alwayes there.

                           <hi>R. Moſes Ben. Maim. in More Nevo. Chim.</hi> l. 1. c. 25.</note> Hence it comes as the the Learnedſt of the Jewiſh Doctors hath well obſerv'd, that the Scripture uſeth this word figuratively, to ſignifie the conſtant and ſetled abiding of one thing in another; though the thing which is ſaid to dwell in the other be not animate, and that other which it is ſaid to dwell in, be not properly a place or a ſpace that containeth it. As when <hi>Job</hi> execrating the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50919:201"/>day of his birth, wiſheth among other things, that <hi>clouds may dwell upon it,</hi> meaning that that day be continually covered with clouds, that it never be without that ſable and ſad veil, and as he explains himſelf, that darkneſs and the ſhadow of death do for ever pollute it; Though to ſpeak properly, it cannot be ſaid that clouds which are inanimate things, do dwell any where, and much leſs dwell in a day or upon a day, which is not a place, or comprehenſive ſpace, but a part of time. And it is alſo in this figurative way that we muſt take all thoſe paſſages of Scripture, in which GOD His dwelling ſomewhere is ſpoken of; as when He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and elſewhere often,
<note place="margin">Exod. 29.45. Lev. 26.12. 1 Cor. 6.16.</note> that <hi>He will dwell in the midſt of the Children of Iſrael;</hi> (a particular which the Apoſtle applyeth alſo to the Church of the New Teſtament) the meaning is, that His Majeſty and His Providence, ſhould alwayes be with the faithful, and never forſake them; though to ſpeak properly, the LORD who is an infinite Eſſence, and filleth Heaven and Earth without being enclos'd by them, dwelleth no where. It's in this figurative ſenſe, that the Apoſtle here doth uſe the word dwell; and verily with much grace and emphaſis, when He ſaith, <hi>Let the Word of CHRIST dwell in you.</hi> His intention is, that it be conſtantly and ſetledly in you; that it be an inmate with your hearts and lips; that it never leave them; And as our Souls dwell in our Bodies, to quicken them and to govern all their motions; in like manner that this Divine Word be the ſoul of your hearts, abiding day and night there, to conduct and regulate all your actions; that it be as well known and as familiar to you, as the perſons that dwell at your houſe, and paſs their whole time with you.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle not content with ſo vivid an expreſſion, addeth yet another term, to ſignifie more fully how ſtudiouſly we ought to fill all the faculties of our Souls, with this Word of the LORD. <hi>Let it dwell in you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>richly,</hi> that is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and as the <hi>French</hi> Bibles have it, plentiouſly, in ſuch ſort as there may be neither any part of its myſteries, which is not found in you; its promiſes, its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, its aſſertions, its prophecies, its inſtructions, being all entertained, and not one of them excluded; nor any part of your ſelves, but this Divine g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſt is admitted to lodge and abide in; your underſtandings, memories, wills, affections, deportments; that it appear in your whole life, and ſhine forth there in ſuch a manner, as every one may perceive it. It's alſo hereunto, that the laſt words which he addeth, <hi>in all Wiſdom,</hi> do refer; wherein he ſhews us the end, and the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate effect of this dwelling of the Word of GOD in us: namely the rendring us wiſe unto ſalvation, and the giving us all the wiſdom that's neceſſary to glorifie GOD, and obtain eternal happineſs. He would have it dwell ſo abundantly in us, that we might derive from it all the knowledge it gives, both of the things we ſhould believe, and of things we ſhould do to be ſav'd. For it's this he uſually meaneth by that Wiſdom which he recommendeth unto us. And becauſe this knowledge hath many parts, of which ſome are uſeleſs without the reſt; thence it comes that he ſaith not ſimply, <hi>let the Word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in Wiſdom,</hi> but <hi>in all Wiſdom;</hi> to ſhew us, that it is not enough to ſtudy ſome part of this Heavenly knowledge. This it may be might have been ſufficient for men under the Old Teſtament, who were but in a minority; a Chriſtian being come to mature and full age, ought to know all the will of GOD, all His counſel, and all that admirable Wiſdome, which He hath revealed to us by His Son, and unfolded in His Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee, Dear Brethren, what the meaning is of this precept of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: In it now, we have a great many things to obſerve. And firſt, his proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, in that having begun diſcourſe of our Sanctification, and not inclining to enlarge upon it further for the preſent, he remits the faithful for learning the reſt not to the voice of the Church, but to the Word of CHRIST; an evident ſign that it's not the Church, as thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend, but Divine Scripture which is ſupream directreſs of the faithful. It is true, that Paſtors are ſerviceable unto their inſtruction, but it is as Miniſters only, and not as Maſters; nor do they Miniſter of their own, but out of the ſtock of this Divine Word; beſide which they ought to teach nothing of themſelves; and if they do they are not to be heard. Secondly, the expreſs order which the Apoſtle gives us, that the Word of CHRIST ſhould
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50919:202"/>dwell richly in us, doth ſhew that it's the duty of Paſtors, ſedulouſly to exhort their Flocks unto the ſtudy, and reading, and meditation of the Divine Scriptures, and that it is incumbent on their flocks to addict themſelves aſſiduouſly thereto. Whence it follows in the third place, that this Word of CHRIST ought to reſound continually every where, in the Church and in its publick Aſſemblies, and in private Families, and the very Cloſets of its Members: Otherwiſe how would it dwell plenteouſly in us? Moreover, ſince the Apoſtle ſpeaks here to all the faithful in general, as well people as Miniſters, this Epiſtle being directed by him <hi>to all the faithful Brethren in CHRIST, which are at</hi> Coloſſe, its evident further, his intention is that not only all Chriſtians do hear this Word in the Church, but that they alſo read it each one in private if they can; and that ſuch reading is not only permitted but commanded them, as profitable and neceſſary. Again, the Apoſtles requiring it ſhould dwell in them, yea dwell richly in them, does neceſſarily infer that it is not enough to know ſome general points of this Heavenly Doctrine; but that men ought to be fully and diſtinctly inſtructed in it, and in ſuch ſort, as there may not be any part of this Divine treaſure, but we are poſſeſſed of. The ſame appears fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the effect which the Apoſtle would have us draw from it, namely our abounding, by means of this word, <hi>in all Wiſdom;</hi> a thing which hath no place in thoſe that have but a ſuperficial, and (as they ſpeak) an implicite, that is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, involved, and entangled knowledge of it. Whence, in fine, it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the Word of CHRIST containeth all things neceſſary to Salvation; it being evident, that he that is ignorant of any part of them, is not owner of Wiſdom, and much leſs of all Wiſdom; which yet the Apoſtle intimates we ſhall have, if the Word of the LORD doth dwell richly in us.</p>
                     <p>Compare now the Law and the Diſcipline of <hi>Rome,</hi> with this Doctrine of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and you ſhall find ſuch a difference, or to ſay better, ſo palpable a contrariety between them, as that the night and darkneſs are not more contrary to the day and its light. Firſt, the Apoſtle remits his Scholars to the Word of CHRIST, to learn there all the duties of Chriſtianity. <hi>Rome</hi> directeth hers unto the Pope and his Officers, to be inſtructed about their Salvation. The Apoſtle gives Sentence, that the Word of CHRIST is capable of giving us all Heavenly Wiſdom, if it dwell in us. <hi>Rome</hi> aſſerts, that it is not ſufficient for this end, and that it contains but ſome part of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wiſdom, for the compleating whereof, unwritten tradition muſt be added. The Apoſtle would have this divine Word dwell in us. <hi>Rome</hi> would not that it ſhould; and introduceth in its place I know not what kind of fabulous Legends, with which it fills the world, giving them to her votaries for the inſtructing and feeding of their Souls. The Apoſtle willeth, that this Word be read, both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and in private among the faithful: <hi>Rome</hi> will not, that either the one, or the other be. As for the publick, if ſhe ſhew her aſſemblies any pieces of it, ſhe ſhews them hidden, and wrapt up in a Language not underſtood, that is, ſhe reads them, and reads them not; it being evident that the proclaiming the Laws and Ordinances of a Soveraign to a people in a language which they do not underſtand, is all one as if they were not in effect proclaimed. It's the holding out a Candle, but a Candle hid under a Buſhel; that is, an holding it not out. It's a preſenting the face of CHRIST unto his people; but a preſenting it veiled and diſguiſed under ſuch a form as they diſcern nothing of it. And as to private reſpects, you know with what indignity <hi>Rome</hi> doth treat Chriſtians, and how ſhe forbids them to read their Father's Teſtament, and judgeth it a crime, that they ſhould handle Books which were made for them, or ſee thoſe Letters which are expreſly directed to them. And that the permiſſion of this reading, which they give ſome Tradeſmen of this City, and the boldneſs of ſome Doctors, who deny even the cleareſt things, may not deceive you, I think it pertinent to repreſent unto you here the Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> touching this matter. Know then that in the Treatiſe and Index of prohibited Books, drawn up by the Authority of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> approved and publiſh'd by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Index libr. pro hibitor. Reg.</hi> 4.</note> and of all His Succeſſors, one of their firſt Rules runs expreſly in theſe words. <hi>Since it is manifeſt by experience, that if the Holy Bible be commonly and indifferently permitted in the Vulgar Tongue, there cometh of it more damage, than profit, by reaſon of the temerity of men; the judgment of the Biſhop or the Inquiſitor
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50919:202"/>muſt be ſtood to, in this caſe; ſo as they by the Counſel of the Pariſh Prieſt, or of the Confeſſor may grant the reading of the Bible in a Tranſlation made by ſome Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Author, unto ſuch as they ſhall find capable of drawing from ſuch reading, not damage or prejudice, but increaſe of faith and piety; and this Licenſe they muſt have in writing. As for thoſe that ſhall preſume to read it without ſuch Licenſe, they may not receive abſolution of their ſins without having firſt rendred up their Bible into the Ordinaries hands. Thus far the Papal Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Was their ever Ordinance more injurious to the Word of GOD, and to His Apoſtles authority? Firſt, their poſition at the entrance, namely, that the common reading of the Bible does more hurt than good, and cauſeth more damage than profit; this I ſay is horrible, and directly contrary both to the Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD, as alſo to S <hi>Paul</hi>'s declaration. For who can believe that GOD ſhould give ſuch Books to His Church, as are more apt to hurt, than to help? And how doth His Apoſtle recommend them to all Chriſtians indifferently, willing that this Word dwell plenteouſly in them, if this be dangerous for them, and rather pernicious than profitable? And why doth he promiſe us from it the fruit of Wiſdom yea of all Wiſdom, if the reading be ſo perillous? Is Wiſdom an evil and damageable thing? But it is eaſie to comprehend the thoughts of <hi>Rome;</hi> She means aſſuredly that reading of the Bible is prejudicial to Her; that it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth her impoſtures, and giving Wiſdom to the Simple, doth arm and fortifie them againſt her corruptions, and pretended traditions. This is in truth the damage and loſs ſhe feareth, and which makes her ſo careful to extinguiſh or ſet aſide all glimpſes of this Heavenly light, to the end ſhe may reign at her care by the favour of darkneſs, And if ſhe would have ſincerely repreſented her motives in this ordinance of hers, there ſhould have been not the Preface, we even now reported, but ſuch a one as this, to wit, it being evident by experience tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the reading of the Bible is very prejudicial to her intereſts, giving men the hardneſs to reject the authority, and Doctrine of her Pope, who is not only not found any where in this Word of GOD, but even contrarieth it in divers inſtance; for theſe reaſons it hath ſeem'd good to her to ſhut up and reſtrain the knowledge of it as much as ſhe can, ſince the aboliſhing it altogether is both impoſſible, and ſcandalous. This is their true meaning, this their true motive. And in very deed you ſee how in concluſion they ſtraiten this reading as much as poſſibly they can. Firſt, they will not have men read any verſion of the Scripture, though never ſo good and faithful, and exactly made out of the Original Texts, except it have (as they ſpeak) ſome Catholique for its Author; that is one or other of thoſe people, who being paſſionate for the <hi>Romane</hi> cauſe, would weaken the words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the moſt they may, and ſometimes even audaciouſly corrupt them for their own advantage; as you may plainly perceive by the example of him, who paſſing the bounds of the modeſty of all others, hath not long ſince put the expreſs term, Maſs, a ſtranger to all Scripture, into the Book of the Acts of the Apoſtles, and written at the third Chapter, that the Prophets and Teachers which were in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> did ſay Maſs againſt the Warrant of the Original, and of all ancient Verſions, the <hi>Syriac,</hi> the <hi>Arabick</hi> and the <hi>Latine</hi> it ſelf canoniz'd by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> every of which does ſay conform to the Original, that thoſe perſons ſerved or Miniſtred to the LORD; againſt the example of the vulgar verſions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, as that of the Doctors of <hi>Lovain,</hi> that of <hi>Benedict,</hi> and of <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and others; and in fine, againſt the evidence of the thing it ſelf, this latter verſion falſly ſuppoſing that there could be no Divine Service, but it's pretended Maſs. Judge by this ſcantling what the verſions of the Bible made by theſe good Catholicks, are like to be. But however altered and diſguiſed in favour of them theſe verſions be, they yet fear them ſtill; well knowing that it is not eaſie ſo to ſophiſticate this Heavenly word, but that it will alwayes have vertue enough left to confound their errors. Therefore they add another reſtriction, that for the reading of ſuch Bibles there muſt be had a Licenſe, and in writing, not from the Pariſh Prieſt (this ſufficeth not) but from the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, or from the Inquiſitor (an office in the Modern Church, which is no more found in Holy Writ, than the office of their Maſs.) And yet they do not leave them an abſolute diſpoſal of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50919:203"/>the matter; but oblige them to ſecure themſelves firſt, by conference and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Curates of the Petitioners, that they are perſons whom the Word of GOD will do no hurt to; that is, will not make them diſguſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; which is at the bottom, all the danger that they apprehend.</p>
                     <p>Chriſtians, do you not tremble to hear that theſe Maſters forbid what the Apoſtle gives you order to do? a thing that JESUS CHRIST Himſelf commands you, when He ſayes, <hi>Search the Scriptures?</hi> and that their diſpenſation muſt be had to do what JESUS CHRIST and His Apoſtle enjoyn you? The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Let the Word of CHRIST dwell in you;</hi> and theſe Gentlemen cry on the other ſide, <hi>No, med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with it. Caſt not your eyes on it. Have not ſo much as the Book in your Houſes,</hi> (which is far indeed from getting it to dwell in your hearts) <hi>except one of our Biſhops, or of our Inquiſitors give you permiſſion for it.</hi> Oh new and unheard of Theology! That a Chriſtian muſt have a diſpenſation from <hi>Rome,</hi> or one of her Miniſters, to obey JESUS CHRIST; and cannot do what S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands him, except the Pope's Officers give him a permiſſion in writing. Can men more openly debaſe the authority of CHRIST, and His Apoſtle? Sure what's commanded is a duty; and that which is permitted (eſpecially what one is obliged to have a permiſſion for in writing) is a thing contrary to our duty, as every one knows, and as you may ſee by the practice of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, where permiſſion to eat fleſh in Lent is indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but not to cat fiſh in the Carneval; becauſe, according to their Laws, the firſt is contrary to a Chriſtian's duty, and not the ſecond. If then a Chriſtian muſt have a permiſſion to read the Bible, it is evident, that the reading of it is a matter of ſome contrariety to a Chriſtians duty; that of it ſelf it is unlawful and prohibited. Again if ſuch reading be duly commanded, it muſt of neceſſity be ſaid, that every one is obliged to it, (at leaſt every faithful man or woman that can read) and that they no more need any one's permiſſion to read the Bible, than to give an alms, or to comfort an afflicted perſon, or to obey their Father or their Prince. S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s command as you ſee is expreſs. <hi>Let the Word of CHRIST dwell in you.</hi> It's then our duty to read it, and meditate it: It's then a manifeſt enterprize againſt the Apoſtles authority, to bind us up that we may not read it without any man's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion who ever he be. It's a changing of what <hi>Paul</hi> hath ordained. It's a taking it out of the rank of duties where he had let it, and a placing it among tranſgreſſions. It's a making that to paſs for prohibited, which the Holy Apoſtle hath commanded; there being no place for a permiſſion, but in things, which the Law of GOD, or of men have forbidden.</p>
                     <p>Can a ſtranger thing be ordained? Yet they ſtoop not here. For fearing leaſt ſuch a permiſſion, though difficult, and ſtrait, and depending upon the will of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſhould yet prejudice their Religion, if any uſe were made of it, they withdraw welnigh altogether, the power to grant it, which they gave the Biſhop and the Inquiſitor afore.

                        </note> For in the obſervation which they add upon this fourth Rule, they declare expreſly, <hi>that the meaning is not, there is by it any power attributed of new to Biſhops or Inquiſitors, or to the Superiors of Regular Societies, to give leave to any to read, or buy, or keep the Bible, or any piece either of the Old, or of the New Teſtament, or ſo much as ſummaries, or hiſtorical abridgments of the Books of Holy Scripture, in any vulgar tongue whatever; becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>they have hitherto been deprived of the power of giving ſuch permiſſions, by the Roman holy general Inquiſition, and it muſt be invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably obſerved.</hi> See, I beſeech you, a moſt manifeſt illuſion! They forbid all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to read the Bible, without the Biſhops or the Inquiſitors permiſſion; But they preſently declare that no Biſhop nor Inquiſitor hath power to give any. Thus there ſhall no perſon be permitted it. Is not this an evident mocking of the world? But theſe gallants do ſo hugely dread the Scripture, that they had rather become guilty of thus ſhamefully, and openly deluding Chriſtendom, than ſuffer any one to have or read ſo dangerous a Book. They would rather ſalve their intereſt, than their honour. And in very deed, ſuch the practice is in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the Territories of the Inquiſition; where this permiſſion to read the Bible is not given to any man, whoever he be; and where it's held for a capital crime, and a ſure mark of Hereſie, to have in houſe but a volume of the Old or New Teſtament in the vulgar tongue. So as it muſt of neceſſity be, that thoſe who do in theſe parts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50919:203"/>this reading unto ſome, are either guilty of violating the general ordinances of that Church they profeſs themſelves members of; or have ſome particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power from the Pope to do, as they do; which yet doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>This crime would be leſs ſtrange, if it did claſh only with this paſſage of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. But it alſo overturneth divers other moſt expreſſe inſtructions,
<note place="margin">Deut. 17.18, 19.</note> which occur in the holy Scriptures. For GOD commands the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who was a Laick, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Deut. 11.18, 19. &amp; 6.7, 8, 9.</note> and read it diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and generally all His people to lay up all His words in their hearts, and in their minds; to bind them for ſigns upon their hands, and for frontlets between their eyes: that is, to have them as familiar as their own hands and eyes; to teach them their children, and diſcourſe of them at home and abroad, lying down, and riſing up; and write them on the poſts of their houſes, and on their gates, which is juſt the ſame thing St. <hi>Paul</hi> here calls in ſhort, an <hi>having the word of GOD to dwell in them.</hi> In effect, St. <hi>Luke</hi> praiſeth the Ethiopian Eunuch,
<note place="margin">Acts 8.28. &amp; 17.11.</note> for that he read the Scriptures; and the men of <hi>Berea,</hi> for that they conſulted them daily, to know, if the things which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> preached to them, were ſo. Yet we no where read,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.2.</note> that they had leave of any Papal Biſhops, or Inquiſitors. And <hi>David</hi> pronounceth that man bleſſed, <hi>who meditateth day and night in the law of GOD.</hi> Again,

I ſay as much, and that more poſitively, of the Apoſtolical Epiſtles; which being directed to the faithful Clergie, and Laity indifferently, there is no reaſon to bar any of them from reading what the firſt Miniſters of GOD wrote to them all.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the fault of our adverſaries is ſo much the more inexcuſable, for that the ancient Doctors, of whom they make ſo great account,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Homil.</hi> 9. on Levitie.</note> are directly contrary to them in this particular. As <hi>Origen</hi> for one, who would have Chriſtians not only hear the word of GOD in the Church, but exerciſe themſelves in reading it at home, and in meditating on it night and day. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> for another,

St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for a third, who does moſt earneſtly recommend the reading of the word of GOD to the very <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> that is, Chriſtians of the loweſt form, ſuch as had not yet received holy Baptiſm. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, that famous Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for a fourth, who gravely reproves a Phyſician of the Court, for that he took not the pains to read the words of our Redeemer every day. For what is holy Scripture (ſaith he) but a letter from GOD to His creature? If you were in a far Countrey, and there received letters from the Emperor your Maſter, you would not be at reſt, nor ſleep at your caſe till you had read them, and perceiv'd what your earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prince ſhould have vouchſafed to write you: The Monarch of Heaven, the LORD of men and Angels hath ſent and conveyed to your hands, His letters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the concernments of your life. And yet, my Son, you deign not to read them. Apply to them, I beſeech you, and meditate daily your Creator's ſayings. Thus <hi>Gregory,</hi> more than a thouſand years a-go. Judge how far the language of later Popes is from his ſpirit, and from his principles. I paſs by other Doctors of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, who are no leſs contrary to this modern abuſe, and will only mention fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to whom the Church hath given the name of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that is, Golden mouth, becauſe of the richneſs and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his incomparable eloquence; he alone would furniſh a man with enough to make a ſmall volume, if any would put together all the paſſages of his works, in which he exhorteth all the faithful, and in ſpecial, thoſe of the people, to an aſſiduous reading of the Holy Scripture; and particularly in the Sermon he made upon this very Text of the Apoſtle, which we are expounding. Hear,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Chryſost</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 9. in Ep. ad Coloſſ.</note> (ſaith he) you that live in the World, and have wife, and children; hear how he orders you,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50919:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>yea, you principally, to read the Scriptures, not ſlightly, and heedleſly, but with great care and diligence. He would have them heed no other maſter; You have (ſaith he to them) the oracles of GOD and no one can teach you ſo well as theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine books. And a little after, Have (ſaith he) the books of the Bible, the true medicines of the ſoul. Get at leaſt the New Teſtament, the Acts of the Apoſtles, the Goſpels. Let theſe be your perpetual Maſters and Teachers. If any affliction befall you, loſs of goods, of children, or of friends; if death it ſelf preſent its ſelf unto you, make ſearch forthwith in this book, as in the ſtore-houſe of coeleſtial medicaments, and fetch out of it the remedies that are neceſſary for the mitigating of your miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; Or rather, that you may not be put to the trouble of ſuch ſearch; lay them all up in your ſoul, and have them ready upon all occaſions. Ignorance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is the cauſe of all our evils. Thus far <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> And truly, as you ſee, he was not of the opinion of the latter Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who do accuſe, as you heard afore, the reading of the Word of GOD, of doing more harm than good.</p>
                     <p>It the reading of them muſt be interdicted upon the pretence, that ſome unſtable ſpirits wreſt them unto their deſtruction, it ſhould be in the firſt place prohibited to Biſhop, Prieſts, and Monks; it being clear, if my memory does not deceive me, that ſuch as have forged hereſies by an ill underſtanding of the Scriptures, were all of one of thoſe three orders, and not of the common people. But it's a very wild expedient, and a remedy altogether extravagant, to condemn the uſe of things, becauſe of the abuſe of them by ſome certain perſons. By this account, beſt, and moſt innocent things, and things moſt neceſſary for the life of men, ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them; the light of the Sun, the ſavourineſs of meats, the excellency of wines and fruits, iron, ſilver, gold, and other metals; the accompliſhments of learning, and the marvels of eloquence. For which of theſe gifts of GOD doth not the intemperance, or the malice of men abuſe? And, as the Prince of Pagan Philoſophers hath rightly obſerved, there is nothing they ſo perniciouſly abuſe, as that which is of its ſelf beſt,
<note place="margin">Ariſtot. Rhet.</note> and moſt profitable. To conclude, ſince the ſame GOD, who knows the nature, and the efficacy of His own Scriptures better than any, commands us all to read them; it's an inſufferable temerity for a man to intrude with his advice, and change what the LORD hath appointed, as if he were wiſer than the Moſt High.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle clearly refuteth this calumny of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt Scripture, in the other part of this Text,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> where he ſets before us the fruits and uſes we ought to draw from it. <hi>Ye teaching</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and admoniſhing one another by Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, with grace, ſinging from your heart unto the LORD;</hi> Elſe-where he advertiſeth us, that <hi>the Scripture is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> Here in like manner he ſetteth down, for the firſt fruit we are to gather from this rich knowledge of the word of GOD, that mutual teaching we owe one another; for the ſecond, advertiſement or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; for a third, conſolation by the ſinging of Pſalms, and ſpiritual Hymns. As to the Firſt; I grant, the charge of teaching in the Church does principally pertain to Paſtors appointed to this end; yet there is not the privateſt believer, but doth alſo participate ſome way of this function, when he hath the gift, and the opportunity, to edifie men in the knowledge of true religion. Particularly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers owe this office to their children, husbands to their wives, maſters to their houſholds, the elder to the younger, and in fine, each one to his reighbour, when he hath the conveniency. Whence appears again how far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the Apoſtles ſentiment is from <hi>Rome's. Paul</hi> would have the Faithful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with, and inſtruct one another in the things of the word of GOD. <hi>Rome</hi> will not let any but the Clergie have power to ſpeak of them.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond uſe we ought to make of the Word of GOD, is our admoniſhing one another. Teaching doth properly reſpect faith; admonition hath reference to manners. The Scripture furniſheth us where-with to diſcharge both the one and the other of theſe two duties; informing us plainly and plentifully, as well of things that are to be beleeved, as alſo of thoſe that are to be done. And it's incumbent on the beleever to acquit himſelf in the matter according to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50919:204"/>he hath, inſtructing the ignorant, and reproving the faulty; all, with a ſpirit of ſweetneſs, and diſcretion, as the Apoſtle doth elſe-where preſcribe. For every man ought to look upon his neighbour as his brother; reduce him, if he ſtray; raiſe him up, if he fall; clear things to him, if he doubt; and have, in fine, as much care of his welfare, as of his own. Far from us be the ferity of thoſe proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who would not be ſollicitous in the leaſt for their brethren's concerns: and who, if GOD ſhould demand an account of them at their hands, would be ready to ſay, as <hi>Cain</hi> ſometime anſwered, <hi>Am I my Brother's keeper,</hi> or Pedagogue? Now as we are to be charitable and prudent for the performing of this ſervice to our brethren; ſo ought we again in our turn, receive it from them, with patience, and meekneſs; Remembring how the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 141.5.</note> 
                        <hi>it ſhall be a kindneſs; and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent balm unto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third and laſt uſe the Apoſtle would have us make of the word of CHRIST, is in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, to ſing from our hearts with grace unto the LORD. The ſo doing doth reſpect partly the glory of GOD, which we ought to celebrate by our ſinging; and partly our own conſolation, and ſpiritual rejoycing. For the LORD is ſo good, that He hath provided e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the recreating of His children; and knowing, that Song, is one of His moſt natural means, extremely proper both to dilate the contentment of our hearts, and render it full-blown, as alſo to alleviate, and mitigate their ſorrows, He hath not only permitted us, but even commanded to ſing unto Him ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſongs. And for the forming us unto ſo holy, and ſo profitable an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, He hath given us in His word a great number of theſe Divine Canticles, as the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> and the Hymns of divers other faithful and religious perſons, diſperſed here and there in the books of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle nameth three ſorts of them, Pſalms, Hymns, or Praiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; and Odes, or Songs. Now, though there be no need to take much pains in an exact diſtinguiſhing of theſe three ſorts of Sonnets; nevertheleſs I think their opinion very probable, who put this difference between them; that a Pſalm is in general any ſpiritual ditty, whatever the ſubject of it be; that an Hymn particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſignifies Sonnets compoſed to the praiſe of GOD; and that an Ode, or Song, is a kind of Hymn, of more art, and various compoſition, than others. You have divers examples of them all in the book of Pſalms. Firſt, all the compoſures there, are called Pſalms in general. But it's very evident they are not all of a ſort. There are ſome, in which is celebrated the goodneſs, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the power of the LORD, either towards <hi>David,</hi> or towards the Church, or in reference to all creatures. Theſe are properly Hymns, and ſuch is the eighteenth Pſalm, the hundred and fourth, the hundred forty fifth, and many others. There are others, in which are myſtically and elegantly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenced with an excellent artificialneſs, either the wonders of CHRIST, as the forty fifth, the ſeventy ſecond, the hundred and tenth, and the like; or the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the ancient people, as the ſeventy eighth, the hundred and fifth, and hundred and ſixth. To theſe properly doth the name of Odes, or Songs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. It's with theſe ſacred layes, of which the word of CHRIST afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us both the matter and the form, that the Apoſtle would have us ſolace our ſelves. St. <hi>James</hi> gives us order for it;
<note place="margin">Jam. 5 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Is any among you merry</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and in repoſe of ſpirit? let him ſing Pſalms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle calleth all theſe ſonnets, ſpiritual, both becauſe of their author, who is the holy Spirit, and alſo for their matter, which concerneth only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly things, the glory of GOD, and our ſalvation, not the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and paſſions, and follies of men, as carnal Poems do. He adds, with grace; ſignifying by that expreſſion, the ſweet and ſaving effect of theſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſongs, which do profit and refreſh both together. He would have us in the third place, to ſing from the heart; that is, not barely with the mouth, as hypocrites, but with the attention, and affection of the heart. In concluſion, he intends that we ſing unto the LORD, that is, unto the praiſe and glory
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50919:205"/>of CHRIST, who is ordinarily ſignified by that term, the LORD, when it is couched ſingle, as here it is.</p>
                     <p>This is the rule he gives us for this holy and ſpiritual melody; a rule, which <hi>Rome</hi> hath as little ſpared as the other, which we have ſeen him preſcribe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our being ſtudious of the word of GOD in general. For firſt, She hath baniſhed from the Church the faithful peoples ſinging; and that ſo far, as thoſe that be of her communion do down-right declare, that to ſing the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> as we do, is an huge ſcandalizing of Chriſtians. Strange Chriſtianity, which is ſcandalized at a ſinging, that the Apoſtle commands; a ſinging, that celebrateth the glory of GOD; a ſinging of what was endited by His Spirit, compoſed by His Prophets, and tendeth not but to the edification and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of faithful ſouls. Certainly, beſide the authority of the Book of GOD, it appeareth alſo by the writings of men, that heretofore in the ancient Church, the Chriſtian people bore a part in the ſinging of Pſalms, and did it both in publick and in private. Again, for what our adverſaries make their Clergie ſing; of what conſcience can they ſay, that they ſing it with the heart; ſince they that hear it, and the greater part of them that ſing it, underſtand it not? all their Anthems being in Latin, a tongue long ſince dead, and unknown to the people. Conſider too, whether the pomp, and the niceneſs, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of their ſinging, and ſuch a many of inſtruments as they mingle with it, and all the other artifices of their muſick, be not more proper for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ear, than the edifying of the ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>But dear Brethren, let us lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſide the defaults of others, and mind our ſelves. Firſt, bleſs we our good GOD, for that He hath ſet up the word of His CHRIST again among us, in its light, and in its genuine uſe; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging this grace of His from the bottom of our hearts, improve His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Let this word be the only governeſs of our hearts, and lives. Hear we its voice in publick, conſult it in private. Let us have theſe divine Books, in which the Holy Spirit hath conſign'd its inſtructions. Read them without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and without fear of finding ought that's dangerous, or venomous in them. They are the Paradiſe of JESUS CHRIST, in which the tree of life grows; and whence flow the ſtreams of ſanctity, of joy, and of immortality; but a Paradiſe, where the old Serpent never entred; where his breath and poiſon are unknown. Fathers and Mothers, inſtruct your children in this wholſome ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Young ones, addict your ſelves to it betimes. Fill your memories out of this treaſury of wiſdom. Men and women, old and young, rich and poor, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unlearned, receive ye all this Divine gueſt whom the Apoſtle hath now lodg'd at your houſe. Let it dwell there (as he hath ordered) richly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly in all wiſdome. If you receive, and treat it with the reſpect it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it will cure your ſouls of all their maladies; it will inform your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of all heavenly truth, and purge them of all the errors of earth, and ſuperſtition. It will fill your hearts with love to GOD, and charity towards your neighbour, and by the efficacy of its truth, extinguiſh all thoſe petty paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that tye you to the World. It will comfort you in your troubles; it will fortifie you in your weakneſſes; it will ſuſtain you in your combats; it will arm you againſt all ſorts of enemies; and guide you in all your waies. It will ſweeten your adverſities, and govern your proſperity; and to compriſe all in few words, it will conduct you to the haven of eternal ſalvation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſtorms of this wretched life. Employ likewiſe this word of the LORD to thoſe uſes which the Apoſtle recommends unto you; even to thoſe mutual teachings and admoniſhings which you owe one another, giving, and receiving them, as there is occaſion, with a ſincere, and truly Chriſtian charity.</p>
                     <p>In fine, poſſeſs the liberty he gives you, of ſinging from the heart with grace unto the LORD, Pſalms, and Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs. This ſole Book of Pſalms, if ye learn it aright, is able to make you for ever happy. Oh GOD! what a ſource of bleſſing and joy do they deprive themſelves of, who reject it, or neglect it? It's a publick magazine of heavenly wiſdom, in which every one
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50919:205"/>may find what is meet for him; the ignorant, whereby to be inſtructed; the knowing, whereon to be exerciſed; the afflicted, wherewith to comfort; and the contented, to recreate himſelf. There are repentant tears for the guilty, and ſongs of thankſgiving for the faithful; preſervatives againſt vice, attractives, and excitements to piety; and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for all kind of Vertues. And the wonder is, that theſe ſo high, ſo uſeful, and ſo neceſſary things, are all preſented us there, in the delicious ſonnets of a graceful, and a pleaſing poetry, as in ſo many vaſes of pearl, and diamonds, and emeralds, to induce us to receive them the more eaſily. Oh ſage inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Great Maſter! wherein we have together pleaſure, and profit; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, and inſtruction of ſoul; at once ſinging, and learning what's moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us. May Himſelf pleaſe to bleſs this Divine artifice, by which He invites, and allures us to Himſelf; and ſo touch our hearts by the efficacy of His Spirit, that as He draws us to Him with theſe holy cords of His ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and love, we alſo on our ſide may freely and chearfully run after Him; to the end that having faithfully followed Him in this World, He may in the next lodge us with Himſelf, in the Sanctuary of His Glory; where bearing our part with the Angels, we ſhall bleſs, and glorifie Him eternally. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; The love that the LORD JESUS hath born us is ſo great, and the benefits He hath conferr'd upon us, are ſo various and ſo precious, that we are evidently obliged to give our ſelves entirely to Him, and we cannot ſubſtract from Him without ingratitude, any part of what we are, or have. He hath laid down His life for us. It is juſt therefore that we again do conſecrate ours unto Him. He hath redeemed us at the price of His blood, and by this admirable ranſom deliver'd from death and hell, not only our Souls, but alſo our Bodies, and our whole Nature. We are therefore wholly His, and have no more any other Maſter, but Him; neither is there any juſtice in the world but will adjudge Him the propriety, and poſſeſſion of what coſteth Him ſo dear. But though of right we be his Vaſſals, yet it hath pleas'd His love that we ſhould belong to Him under another much more glorious title. For He hath made us His brethren, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained of His Father, that He ſhould adopt us for His children, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated this grace with all the higheſt favours that creatures can be exalted to. I mean, He hath made us partakers of His inheritance, and communicated to us His Nature and His Spirit, and crowned us with His immortality, and with His glory. Though he had not ſhed His Blood for us as He did; who ſeeth not, but that this His great and divine liberality ſhould have purchas'd Him all the life, and being, and motion we can have? and that to divert any part of it from His ſervice, would be a robbing of Him and a bereaving Him with abominable Sacriledge of a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Him ſo legitimatly, and for many ſo juſt and weighty reaſons. If we be not the moſt unjuſt and ingrateful perſons in the world, we ought all to have ſuch
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50919:206"/>ſentiments, and conſequently look upon our nature, and our life, as things no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ours, but JESUS CHRIST's; and diſpoſe of them not after our own phanſie, and for our own intereſt, but at His pleaſure, and for His glory. And as you ſee that the ſervants of a Prince (above all thoſe whom he hath particularly obliged and favoured) do ſet up his arms through all their houſes, and adorn their Halls and Chambers with his Picture, and have his praiſes alwayes in their mouth, and fill up their whole life with his name and glory; ſo ſhould we do to JESUS CHRIST, and with ſo much the more zeal, for that He is a LORD infinitely more rich, more clement, more liberal, and more beneficent than any Monarch of the Earth. Let our Souls and Bodies therefore bear His badges; let His glory appear exalted in all our actions; let the words of our mouths be dedicated to Him; and our whole lives full of His Name, breathing throughout nothing but His honour and ſervice, without ever ſwerving from His Will, from His intereſts. This, Beloved Brethren, is the Leſſon which the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> now gives us, in the words that you have heard. <hi>And whatever ye do</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether in word or work, do it all in the name of the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, giving thanks by Him unto our GOD and Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe words he concludeth that excellent exhortation which he makes to all Chriſtians in general, of what ſex, or age, or condition ſoever. He began it at the firſt Verſe of this Chapter, and continues it on to our Text, pointing out in it briefly, but divinely, as you have heard in the precedent exerciſes, our principal duties; on one hand the mortifying of the fleſh with its luſts, as fornication, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, wrath, and the like; on the other hand, the ſtudying and exerciſing of all Chriſtian vertues, as humility, kindneſs, patience, gentleneſs, charity and peace. To all theſe he addeth, our knowing and continual meditating of the Word of GOD, with Pſalms, and ſpiritual Hymns. And here it was, we made ſtay in our laſt action upon this Subject. Now, that he might not ſtand to treat ſeverally of all a Chriſtians other duties, which would be prolix, and even infinite, and a Diſcourſe of too great extent for an Epiſtle, before he paſſeth to that particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, which he addreſſeth in the following Verſes to ſome certain ranks of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as to Married perſons, to Fathers, to Children, to Servants and Maſters, he cloſeth up his firſt matter, with the precept he here gives us. A precept verily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and well worthy to Crown his exhortation, ſince it comprehends in few words all the duties of a Chriſtian, both thoſe which the Apoſtle hath expreſly pointed at, and thoſe which his deſign of brevity cauſed him to paſs over in ſilence, without ſpeaking of them by name. To the end we may give you an expoſition of it, we will endeavour, (by the grace of our LORD) to explain one after another, the two parts, that offer themſelves in it: Firſt, that <hi>whatever we do either in word or work, we do it all in the name of the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> Secondly, that we <hi>give thanks by Him to our GOD and Father</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Apoſtle pronounceth, that <hi>all we do in work or word be done in the name of the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> he clearly gives Him our whole life. For theſe two ſorts of things, which he ſubjecteth unto Him, words and works, do comprehend all the other parts of our life; it being evident that nothing iſſues from us, but what may be referred to the one or the other of theſe two kinds: They are either words, or works. Words are the fruits of our mouths; works are the effects or actions of our other parts and faculties. I acknowledge, that beſide this, our ſpirit alſo does act within us, when it knows or conſiders things, and deſireth or rejecteth them. But beſides, that theſe internal actions might be put into the rank of our works, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the word a little beyond its ordinary ſignification, (as in effect ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters do give it ſuch a meaning here) beſide this, I ſay it is evident, that moſt of the conceptions, and affections, and reſolutions of the Soul do refer to words, and external works, as being the principles and motives of them. For it is not poſſible that our words and works ſhould be in the name of our LORD and Saviour, except our underſtandings and wills do ſo addreſs them, and it's properly this action of the Soul, the Apoſtle ſignifies, when he orders, that we do in the name of CHRIST all we do. The tongue indeed pronounceth the words, and the hands and other parts of our bodies do execute thoſe actions of ours, which are called works. But it's the Spirit that moves them all, and that directeth and guideth on their functions to that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50919:207"/>end or deſign it hath propoſed to its ſelf, and draws them from ſuch motives as it hath conceiv'd, and form'd within its ſelf. And it is properly upon this, that the difference of mens actions doth depend. It's this Character that gives them the name, and title they have in Chriſtian Morality. Works, that are the ſame as to the external action, do ſometimes prove nevertheleſs very different, and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, one good, another bad; becauſe the Spirit that produceth them is not the ſame. As for inſtance, the alms of an ambitious man, and of a true believer have no external difference; the ones act in that regard is the ſame the others is; yet if you conſider the inward ſprings of them both, you will find that the one is a piece of vanity, and the other a fruit of charity. Whence it comes, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the reſemblance they have in open view, they are yet at the bottom, works of a quite different nature; the one evil and condemned of GOD, the other good and acceptable to the LORD. The one with all its outſide paint and colour, is an act of vice, the other of vertue. The ſame is to be ſaid of thoſe two kinds of Preaching, which the Apoſtle, mentions in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians;</hi> the one of thoſe that Preached CHRIST through envy,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.15, 16.</note> and of contention; the other, of ſuch as preached Him of good will, and of love. The language of them both was the ſame; but the diverſity of their deſigns render'd their actions ſo different, that the one's to ſay the truth was a ſacriledge, and an abomination; the other's on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, one of the beſt and moſt excellent works of Chriſtian piety and charity. Thus you ſee the rule, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us, to order all the external actions of our lives, our words, and works; even <hi>that we do all in the Name of the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The rule is ſhort and eaſie; but of vaſt and almoſt infinite uſe. As a little ſquare ſerve's an Artificer to deſign, and mark out a multitude of lines, and to diſcover and correct all thoſe that are amiſs; ſo by this little rule, which the Apoſtle puts in our hands, there is no humane action but we may certainly perceive, whether it be right or wrong; good or evil; and conform to the will of GOD, or otherwiſe; neither is there any part of our lives, but this rule, if we take care to adjuſt them by it, is capable of guiding and forming unto perfection. Now as the name of GOD in Scripture ſignifies ſometimes that Ebrew word of four Letters, which the LORD takes for His name and memorial diſtinguiſhing Himſelf by that appellation, from all thoſe GODs, to whom the error of Nations wrongfully gave that quality, and the honours due to it; ſo likewiſe the name of JESUS is ſometimes taken, for this very word JESUS, which (as you know) is the name that was given Him by the expreſs command of GOD. And ſo thoſe of the communion of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeem to underſtand it,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.10.</note> in that paſſage of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>that in the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth;</hi> uncovering, as oft as they hear the word JESUS pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; as if the Apoſtles meaning were, that all creatures, coeleſtial, terreſtrial, and infernal, ſhould do reverence when thoſe two Syllables JESUS are uttered. Wherein verily they are much miſtaken: the import of that paſſage beeing quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. It's not thus neither, that S <hi>Paul</hi> takes the name of JESUS in our Text: as if he ſimply intended that in our actions and diſcourſes we ſhould not fail to intermix alwayes the word JESUS, having it inceſſantly in our mouths, and never doing nor ſaying any thing without pronouncing it firſt. Far be it from us to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that ſuch a thought ſhould fix upon the Apoſtles mind. It is not the word, nor the letters, or ſyllables of this name that he recommends unto us. I grant, we cannot have it too much in our mouths; provided it flow into them from the heart, and that it be a religious and reſpectful conſideration, which makes us mention it, and not a vain and childiſh ſuperſtition, as if there were ſome ſecret vertue annexed unto words.</p>
                     <p>We are to note then in the ſecond place, that as the Name of GOD is very often taken in Scripture for the power, the authority, the will, reſpect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of GOD; in like manner is the Name of JESUS. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> foretelling the coming of the Meſſiah;
<note place="margin">Deut. 18.19.</note> 
                        <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that whoſoever will not hearken unto my words, which He ſhall ſpeak in my Name, I will require it of him.</hi> Which He ſhall ſpeak in my Name, that is, by my order and authority, and in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50919:207"/>acquitting himſelf of the charge which I have committed to Him; And it's thus we frequently read, that the Prophets ſpake in the name of GOD; that is, by His expreſs command, they being ſent and diſpatched from Him.
<note place="margin">2 Kings 2.24.</note> And it's ſaid of <hi>Eliah,</hi> that he <hi>curſed the children that reviled him in the name of the LORD,</hi> that is, by His authority. And this form of ſpeech was ſo common among the Jews, that the Prieſts and Elders demanded of the Apoſtles in the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 4.7.</note> 
                        <hi>in whoſe name they had done that miracle;</hi> meaning upon whoſe authority, and by whoſe order they had undertaken it. The ſame expoſition is to be given of that which the Pſalmiſt ſingeth, <hi>We will boaſt in the name of the LORD our GOD,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 20.8.25.</note> that is, in His help, and power; and ſpeaking of the faithful unto GOD, <hi>They ſhall rejoyce</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in thy name;</hi> that is, in the confidence they have in thy power and goodneſs; of like import is that which he addeth, <hi>that the Horn of His anointed ſhall be exalted in His name;</hi> that is, by His might, and by the vertue and order of His providence.

                     <p>It's therefore in the ſame manner, we are to take this phraſe in the name of CHRIST, which often occurs in the Books of the New Teſtament, as in S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Prophecying, and caſting out Devils in the name of the LORD,</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.22. &amp; 24.5 Acts 5.28.</note> by His authority, and in His might; and when men are ſaid <hi>to come in His name,</hi> that is, to avouch themſelves His, and to affirm themſelves ſent by His order; to <hi>ſpeak, and teach in the name of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>to be aſſembled in His name,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 18.30.</note> that is, for His cauſe, and unto His honour, and with confidence in Him. It's in this ſenſe the Apoſtle takes theſe words in our Text. <hi>Do all things in the name of the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> He means, firſt, that we refer all we do unto His glory, and take His honour for the end of all our actions: and ſecondly, that we act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to His will, and order; and laſtly, with an entire confidence in Him; not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming ought of our ſelves; as if we were able to do any thing conſiderable by our own ſtrength: nor expecting any ſucceſs, but only from His favour, and benediction. Such is the rule, which the Apoſtle here gives us.</p>
                     <p>By it you ſee, Firſt, that he baniſheth out of our lives, all the unfruitful works of darkneſs, that is all vitious actions, actions contrary to juſtice, to charity, and to other Chriſtian vertues; it being evident, that if we do nothing but in the name of the LORD JESUS, we ſhall do none of theſe things; ſince they all are oppoſite to His will, to His commands, and to His glory. Secondly, by the ſame means he perfecteth and enliveneth all thoſe works of ours, which of themſelves and in their kind, are good and commanded of God; engrafting them, by this rule, upon the true motive from which they ought to proceed, and directing them to the true end unto which they ought to tend, which is without doubt the name of CHRIST, and clenſing them from all that impurity and viciouſneſs which vanity, or ſelf-love might taint them with. Good will be truly good, if we do it in the name of JESUS CHRIST, that is, for His ſake, upon conſideration of Him alone, without ſeeking the approbation and acceptance, or the intereſt and ſervice of any other. Laſtly, by the ſame rule, the Apoſtle ſanctifies thoſe of our words and actions, which are in their own nature indifferent, purifying them by the name of the LORD from the filth and abuſe wherewith the viciouſneſs of men doth pollute them, and elevating them to a degree of moral goodneſs, which they had not of themſelves, in that he conſecrates them to the name of the LORD, and makes them to ſerve grace, whereas of themſelves they were inſtituted only for the uſes of nature. For inſtance, if you obſerve this rule of the Apoſtle in your eating and drinking actions, as every one knows indifferent of their own nature; firſt this ſacred name of the LORD JESUS will purge the exerciſe of them, of the exceſſes of intemperance and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs on one hand; and of the vain and fooliſh ſcruples of ſuperſtition on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50919:208"/>Secondly, being referred to the honour of GOD, and accompanied with invocation of His grace, and thankful acknowledgement of His bounty, of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as they were in themſelves, they become good, and holy, and acceptable unto GOD.</p>
                     <p>However, I willingly grant, that we muſt not ſo take the Apoſtles precept, as if we were obliged in every act, even to the leaſt word we utter, to raiſe our thoughts actually to the name of JESUS CHRIST, and expreſly implore His aſſiſtance by a particular prayer, and formally eye His glory. It ſufficeth, that we frequently, and ordinarily make this application of mind, to the name, to the command, to the help, and to the glory of our LORD. But neceſſary it is, that we have the habit of this holy diſpoſition ſo formed and radicated in our hearts, that even when time or place, or ſome other neceſſity ſurprizeth us, and gives us not the leiſure to think actually on the name of the LORD, our ſouls yet do bend that way, as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being ſo habituated to it, as without other diſcourſe or conſideration, they may as to the ſubſtance, diſcharge this duty: and never do, nor ſay any thing that tendeth not to the glory of our Saviour, and is not conform to His will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the reſolution we all ought to have of relying on JESUS CHRIST alone, and referring none of our actions to any other end, than His honour.</p>
                     <p>But I come to the other part of our Text, wherein the Apoſtle adds, that we give thanks by JESUS CHRIST <hi>unto our GOD and Father.</hi> Theſe words may be taken two wayes, either for another precept apart added to the former; or for ſome part and dependance of it. In the firſt relation, it's a new order the Apoſtle gives us, to thank GOD for the benefits He hath vouchſafed us in His Son. He gives the ſame order to the faithful at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in welnigh the ſame words. <hi>Giving thanks alwayes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for all things in the name of our LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, unto our GOD and Father.</hi> Under the ſecond conſideration, the words are a reaſon of what he recommended afore, and the title, under which we ought to do all things in the name of the LORD JESUS; namely, for the rendring unto GOD the Father by His Son the thanks we owe him: ſo as our whole life may be but homage, and a perpetual act of gratitude to GOD by JESUS CHRIST His Son our LORD. For it is not to be doubted, but that the beſt and moſt proper means of thanking GOD the Father for thoſe infinite benefits He hath confer'd upon us, by the communion of His Son, is ſo to frame our lives, that we neither do nor ſay any thing, but in the name of that Son of His: that is, (as we have explained it) according to His will, and for His glory. Now though it import not much which of theſe two expoſitions we follow; ſince at the bottom the thing is ſtill the ſame; yet it ſeems to me the latter is more pertinent, becauſe it doth better and more clearly connect the Apoſtles words.</p>
                     <p>Thankſgiving is one of the moſt neceſſary and moſt univerſal offices of a Chriſtian. For if it be ingratitude to receive a kindneſs from any one, without reſenting it, and giving him thanks for it; what moment of our lives is there, wherein we are not obliged to perform this duty unto GOD? Firſt of all, this being of ours, this life, this body, this ſoul, and all the faculties of our nature, are largeſſes of His, which for all they be common to us with other men are not to be deſpiſed, but ought to be conſider'd as effects of an infinite goodneſs. Then again, what remerciments, doth not the ſending of His Son into the world, and the death He ſuffered for us by the will of His Father, oblige us to? What ſhall I ſay, as to thoſe infinite bleſſings. He hath obtained for us, the remiſſion of our ſins, our adoption to the number of His children, the glory and immortality we hope for? Add hereto, His continual providence both over His Church in general, and over each of us in particular; His favourable bearing with us, however great be not only our infirmities, and imperfections; but even infidelities and ingratitudes; the admirable conſtancy of His Divine grace, which our indignities can neither overcome, nor put off; and imperfections; but even infidelities and ingratitudes; the admirable conſtancy of His Divine grace, which our indignities can neither overcome, nor put off; and though often refuſed, or ill receiv'd, yet ceaſeth not to follow us; but He comes again towards us every morning, and diſpatcheth daily ſome new Herald to ſollicit us to repentance; this Sun that ſhines about us; this air with which he refreſheth us; ſo many various fruits of the earth, with which He feedeth us; the Word of His Goſpel, by which He inſtructeth us; His Sacraments, at which He feaſteth us;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50919:208"/>the voice of His Spirit, either to comfort us, or awaken us in our evils; the ſtrokes of His paternal diſcipline, which he ſo aptly adminiſtreth, tempering them in ſuch ſort, that it is eaſie to ſee; He ſcourgeth us for our amendment, to win us, not to deſtroy us. And if we love our Neighbours as we ought, what ample matter of thankſgiving, doth GOD's dealing with them afford us? His forbearance to ſome, waiting for, and inviting them to repentance? the grace He exerciſeth towards others, either in bringing them to, or conſerving them in His Son? the admirable gifts, ſo richly and ſo wiſely diverſified, which He imparteth to one? and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous ſucceſs wherewith He favours the employment of others? there being not a perſon in the Church, how unfurniſh'd and inconſiderable ſoever in our ſeeming, but this good Maſter hath given one or other of His talents to? Though we had the tongues, and voices of all the Angels of Heaven, yet could we not worthily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or repay with thanks enough, a goodneſs ſo ineſtimable, and ſo every way infinite.</p>
                     <p>But obſerve, that it is to our GOD and Father the Apoſtle ordereth us to make our thankſgivings: and reaſonable it is, that the glory of it ſhould be given Him, ſince He is the firſt and head ſpring of all. Not but that we may rightly addreſs our retributions as well as our petitions unto the Son alſo, and the Holy Spirit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the examples the Apoſtles themſelves have left us of it in divers places of Scripture. But both in the creation, and alſo in the reſtauration of the world, the Father is ſtill repreſented unto us as the firſt principle of the action, the Son and the Holy Spirit acting next; as perſons who ſubſiſt in ſuch order, that the Father is the firſt, the Son the ſecond, and the Holy Ghoſt the third; though ſetting aſide this order, and the diſtinction of their perſons, their nature be in all things, and every way the ſame, in reſpect both of eſſence and of properties or attributes, and of all eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial operations. In fine the Apoſtle preſcribes yet further, that it be by JESUS Chriſt we render thanks to GOD the Father. Firſt, for that He is as it were the firſt and the chiefeſt channel, by which all this goodneſs of GOD is poured forth upon us. For it's He alone that hath acquired all the graces which mankind poſſeſs; by reaſon whereof He is called <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs, the light and the Saviour of the world, the Prince and the author of life, in whom dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily;</hi> And Secondly, becauſe our thanks themſelves cannot be grateful to the Father, nor come into His preſence before the throne of His grace, except they be addreſſed and preſented by JESUS CHRIST, who alone is able to perfume both our perſons and our poor performances, with that odour which is neceſſary for all that would appear without confuſion, before this Supreme Majeſty. This is that, Beloved Brethren, which we had to deliver to you, for the expounding of theſe words of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There remaineth now the chiefeſt point of all; even that you engrave them deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on your hearts, and take them for the rule of your whole lives, applying them to each one of your actions, and making thoſe wholſome uſes of them, which this great Apoſtle gave them for. I will point at ſome of them at preſent, beſeeching GOD to bleſs them unto your edification, and remit the reſt to your own pious medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Obſerve then firſt, for the confirmation of your faith, that excellent proof the Apoſtle gives us here, of the Divinity of the LORD JESUS. For as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> concludeth it, from the Father's naming Him His Son,
<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.5, 6.</note> and treating Him quite otherwiſe, than he doth the Angels, the higheſt of all creatures; ſo may we reaſon in like manner from this paſſage of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſay as that Epiſtle ſaith of the Angels; of which of the Prophets, or the Martyrs, or the Apoſtles, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Here, as you ſee the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle requires, that not only ſome part of our faith, but that our whole life, and all our ſanctification, be referred to the Name of the LORD JESUS. It muſt be therefore neceſſarily concluded, that He is, not a meer creature, but very GOD, of an infinite goodneſs, power, and wiſdom, eternally bleſſed with the Father.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50919:209"/>It is not poſſible, that an inferiour nature ſhould be the ſupport, and the foundation, and the laſt, and higheſt end of all the works and words of all the faithful. Either all the Scriptures of GOD are to be effaced, and new ones made after the fantaſie of Heretiques, or it muſt be confeſs'd, that this JESUS is GOD, to whom they give a Name, capable of being both the beginning, and the end of all parts of the lives of all the faithful that are, or ever ſhall be in the world; conformably to their own aſſerting elſewhere, that <hi>He is the Father of eternity, the Prince of peace, our great GOD, and Saviour.</hi>

We daily hear them repeat their Oriſons, ſay their Beads, ask and give Alms, one of the choiceſt Sacrifices of Chriſtian Religion, make their pilgrimages for devotion, build their temples, conſecrate their images and their holy places, and their preciouſeſt poſſeſſions, and in fine their own perſons to the name of the Bleſſed Virgin, of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> of S. <hi>Denis,</hi> and a multitude of other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ancient and modern.

                     <p>But having conſidered what the Apoſtle affords us here againſt error, for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our faith; let us now obſerve what he teacheth us for the correction of our manners, which is his principal intention. He teacheth us, My Brethren, that if we will be truly faithful perſons, and Chriſtians, as we make profeſſion to be, we muſt have JESUS CHRIST continually before our eyes; muſt examine, addreſs, and ſute our actions, our ſpeeches and purpoſes unto the name of CHRIST; take it for the North-ſtar in our courſe, and in one word for the rule of our whole life. That we never do any thing little or great, otherwiſe than in His name. That His name be the only motive inducing us to ſpeak, and act; and the only mark at which our
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50919:209"/>words and actions tend. Think now firſt, how great our confuſion ought to be, The Apoſtle willeth, <hi>that whatever we do in word or work, we do it all in the name of the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S;</hi> and the moſt of us quite contrary, do almoſt nothing in His Name. Heaven and earth are witneſſes, that the name of JESUS hath no part in our works or words. They are all conſecrated to His enemies; they are inſpired by their ſpirit; and aim at nothing but their intereſts. Tell me, ye covetous, is it in the name of JESUS CHRIST that ye toil night and day to heap up dung? Is it He that taught you thoſe black arts and inhumane dexterities, to ſpoil the Orphan, and the Widow for the enriching of your ſelves? Have you had the confidence to call upon the name of JESUS, that He might teach you and guide your hands to work deceit, and bleſs your violences? Is it to advance His glory, and give His name a good odour, that you make your ſelves famous among the Vaſſals of Mammon? not diſdaining any part of his drudgery, how diſtaſtful ſoever to GOD and man? And you that are ambitious, can you indeed perſwade your ſelves, that thoſe vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that take you up, are ſo important unto JESUS CHRIST? Or that it is in His Name you loſe your time about them? You alſo, whom the fleſh and its pleaſures do drown in their ordures; in conſcience, is it in the name of JESUS CHRIST you are employed? Is it for His glory, or according to His will? I ſay as much of the revengeful and the drunken, and of all thoſe that ſerve any one of the other vices, which JESUS CHRIST hath expreſly condemned, and forbidden. No one of all theſe do's act in His name. Dear Brethren, let us renounce theſe things, if we will be Chriſtians. Let us never make any enterprize, never ſet upon any action, but firſt conſider, whether it may be done in the name of the LORD JESUS; that is, whether it be ſuch as we may with a good conſcience implore His help to finiſh it: and judge either proper to advance His glory and conform, or at leaſt not contrary to His will, and intereſts. Hereby we are obliged to baniſh out of our lives? firſt, all vitious actions, of which none can be done in the name of JESUS CHRIST, ſince they are all diſpleaſing to Him. And they that in deſigns of ſuch nature have the impudence to ask aſſiſtance of Him, (as ſome there be, whom ſuperſtition hath inſpir'd this ſottiſh conceit into, that they may do evil for a good end) theſe I ſay offend JESUS CHRIST exceſſively, rendring Him guilty of their crimes, as much as in them is, and inviting Him to take part in their vices. But this rule of the Apoſtle doth not only oblige us to eſchew evil, and abſtain from ſin. It requireth alſo, that what good we do, be done for CHRIST's ſake, and in His name; that in our alms, and in our devotions, and in all the acts of our piety and charity, we ſeek nothing but His glory, the fulfilling of His will, and the advancement of His Kingdom, and not the praiſe of men, or the intereſt of our own affairs. It's a taking of His name in vain to do otherwiſe, It's a prophaning the actions of vertue, by employing them in the ſervice of fleſh and blood; them which of their own nature, and by GOD's intention, are not to be done but for His glory, and for His Son's name ſake.</p>
                     <p>In fine, this maxim of the Apoſtle's embracing generally all the things a Chriſtian doth both in word and work; 'tis evident that it ought to regulate thoſe alſo, which are in their own nature indifferent; he never ſetting about them, but when he may do them in the name of CHRIST. For though the nature of them be indifferent, the uſage of them is not ſo; but muſt be governed by the good and the evil, that may thence redound, either to, or againſt the glory of GOD, and the edification of men, as the Apoſtle ſayes elſewhere; <hi>All things are lawful for me; but all things are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; All things are lawful for me; but all things edifie not.</hi> Whence you ſee,

I grant the uſe of theſe things to ſpeak in general, is free; they all being created of GOD for man. Yet this hinders not, but each of you ought to obſerve certain rules about them, and this one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, namely, that ye conſider whether the thing be ſuch as ye may do it in the name of JESUS CHRIST; whether the money you waſte in it, might not be better
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50919:210"/>employed in the ſervice of His poor, or of His Sanctuary; whether your making men believe that you are vain glorious, or intemperate, or voluptuous, by clothing or lodging, or treating your ſelves more richly and more magnificently than beſeems your condition; whether this opinion, I ſay, which you give your Neighbours of you, does not ſcandalize them; and be not prejudicial unto the name and intereſts of our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>Hence again appears, how inexcuſable they are that marry with perſons of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion, I confeſs, that Marriage is honourable; and that it is not prohibited to any: But this action, as well as all a Chriſtians others, muſt be <hi>done in the name of the LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S;</hi>

Wherefore the Apoſtle doth expreſly modifie the liberty he gives the believing widow by this exception. <hi>She is at liberty</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to marry again; only ſo as it be in the LORD.</hi> Now judge if it be a marrying in the LORD, when you make alliance with a perſon allienate from your communion; who will be a ſnare to pervert you from it; will pluck the name of CHRIST out of your houſe; and conſecrate your blood to error; and be ſo far from helping you in the exerciſes of your piety, that the perſon will diſturb them.</p>
                     <p>In fine, this ſaying of the Apoſtle's ſhews us alſo, what we are to think of Dances and Balls, and ſuch other vain pomps of the world; If you can truly ſay, that it is in the name of CHRIST you Maſque and Dance; I will accord, that you fail not of your duty in it. But if it be clear, and manifeſtly known as it is, that the LORD JESUS hath no part in theſe follies, that in them His name is blaſphem'd rather than glorified; that His Spirit breaths not in them, but indeed the Spirit of Satan, and the world; that ſcandal is given in them, but no edification received; confeſs it a thing contrary to your duty. Add not impudence to guilt; acknowledge if you be a Chriſtian, that it's a violation of the Apoſtle's order, to participate in ſuch things which neither are, nor can be done in the name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. I advertiſe you particularly of it, becauſe we are entring on the ſeaſon, in which the world is won't to give it ſelf the greateſt licence for ſuch debauches. Dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let not it's ill examples ſeduce you. Let not the cuſtome of the age, nor the pleaſing of men, induce you to forget the reſpect you owe to the Apoſtles voice, and the Churches conſolation. Seek your joys in the ſervice of your LORD, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and in the meditation and expreſſing of His life; and having always before your eyes, the love He beareth you, the death He ſuffered for you, and the Heaven to which He calleth you, love Him with all your heart; <hi>and whatever you do, whether in word or work, do it all in the name of this ſweet and merciful Saviour, rendring thanks by Him to our GOD and Father, unto His glory, and the edification of your Neighbours, and your own Salvation.</hi> Amen.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; As man is ſubject to a twofold conſideration; firſt, in regard of his nature ſimply, as he is a reaſonable creature; ſecondly, in reference to his condition, or the rank he holds in humane ſociety, that is, as either a Maſter or a Servant, a Magiſtrate or a Subject, or the like; ſo he is obliged according to theſe two different reſpects, to two divers ſorts of duties; thoſe of the firſt ſort are general, and common univerſally to all men; the others of the ſecond do relate, but to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order of perſons only. I place in the firſt rank piety towards GOD, honeſty, temperance, juſtice, and charity, and ſuch other vertues, for which neither ſex, nor age, nor condition doth diſpenſe with any; becauſe every man, whatever he is otherwayes, being a reaſonable creature, is bound upon that account to practice all thoſe vertues, as a perfection and ornament meet for ſuch a nature. I reckon among the duties of the ſecond ſort, the ſervice that bondmen owe their maſters, the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of children to their fathers, the dependance of wives in relation to their husbands, and the like; which pertain as you ſee, only to perſons in ſuch conditions, and not to all men generally. This difference hath produc'd in the Schools of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Sages, the diſtinguiſhing of active Philoſophy into divers parts; the firſt whereof, which they call Moral Philoſophy, or the Ethiques, do's explain that firſt ſort of common, and general duties; the others do treat of the ſecond; to wit, the Economicks, which regulate and form the ſeveral different conditions, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a family; namely husband, and wife; parents, and children; maſter, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and the Politicks, whoſe task is to expound the devoirs of all the divers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that compoſe an Eſtate, as the Prince, and the Subject; the Magiſtrate, and the Citizen; men of the long Robe, and of the Sword; and the like.</p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:50919:211"/>
                     <p>The Apoſtles of our LORD, in thoſe writings, which they have left us, where they have unfolded to us the Divine Philoſophy of their Maſter, have alſo followed the ſame order; though their difference otherwayes be very great. For they ſet before us in like manner ſome general duties, which oblige all Chriſtians of what quality ſoever, and in whatever degree of ſociety, either civil, or domeſtick, or religious, they be placed. And though this part being once well comprehended, hath in it a great and almoſt ſufficient light to direct and govern all the reſt: yet they forbear not upon it, to deſcend unto the particular duties of each of thoſe eſtates and conditions which the faithful live in, in humane ſociety. Thus the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath done in this Epiſtle; for after having formed us all in general unto piety, and ſanctity, and charity, which belong to all Chriſtians equally; as you have heard in the precedent exerciſes; he now addreſſeth himſelf in particular to each of thoſe three orders, of which an houſhold is compoſed; the firſt whereof is the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and the Wife; the ſecond, the Father, and the Children; the third, Maſter, and Servants; giving each of them a good leſſon, for their conduct in the condition to which GOD hath called them. Elſewhere he regulateth the duties of Subjects in reference to the civil Powers under which they live; of the faithful in reference to their Paſtors, and reciprocally of Paſtors in reference to their flocks; not omitting Deacons, the other part of Eccleſiaſtick Miniſtry: and this not in one place alone, but many. In conſideration hereof, before we proceed any further, permit me, I beſeech you, to make here at the entrance one general reflection upon this the Holy Apoſtles way of treating; thus,</p>
                     <p>Whence comes it, that having been ſo careful to inſtruct and to direct in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar each of thoſe different ranks of perſons, which then were, and ſtill are in the Church, they never drop'd one word of the duties of three kinds of conditions, in which now a dayes <hi>Rome</hi> makes the main, and in a manner the all of the Chriſtian Commonweal, to conſiſt, I mean the Pope, Sacrificers or Prieſts, and Monks? The Apoſtles do inſtruct the loweſt Maſters, how they ought to treat their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; and the ſimpleſt Presbyters, or Biſhops (that is, Paſtors) how they ought to feed their flocks. They never tell the Pope in what manner he ought to deport himſelf, in that great government of all Chriſtendom, which, as is ſaid, hath been given him of GOD. The Apoſtles do advertiſe the moſt abject ſlaves, of the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude they owe their Maſters; and every flock of the diference and reſpect it owes its Paſtors. They never ſpeak a word, either to ſingle believers or their guides, of that infinite ſubjection which they are obliged to profeſs unto the Pope, or of ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ing his feet, or of ſubmitting the conſcience, or any other ſuch like thing. The Apoſtles do exactly inform Biſhops or Paſtors of the duties of their charge: of preaching, exhorting, inſtructing, of watching, of correcting, of cenſuring, of excluding the ſcandalous from communion. They never order any Sacrificers to offer a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory hoaſt unto GOD, for the ſins of quick and dead; nor tell them of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ceremonies, and obſervances neceſſary thereto; nor of purifying, by means of an auricular confeſſion, the conſciences of ſuch as are to participate of ſuch a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; nor of the precautions and ſubtilties that are neceſſary for the right admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it. In fine, the Apoſtles verity vouchſafe to take the pains to enter into Families, and there regulate the demeanour of Husbands and Wives, of Virgins and Widows, of Fathers and Children, of Maſters and Servants. Why ſay they nothing unto Monks? neither to the ſolitary, as Hermits and Anachorets; nor to thoſe that live aſſociated in ſeparated dwellings? Why do they not ſomewhere inſtruct the Guardians, the Abbots, the Superiours and Generals of theſe orders? Why do they not exhort their inferiors to yield them a blind obedience? Why ſay they nothing of their three vows? and of the means of well obſerving them? And why give they no inſtructions to Religious women, who imitating the zeal of men, ſhut themſelves up in Convents? But what ſay I; that they no where regulate the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and particular duties of theſe three ſorts of conditions? More than ſo, they make no mention of them at all, neither expreſly, nor implicitly. And if you read the Books of the New Teſtament, you will find that there is no more ſpeech in them, of the Pope and the Sacrificers, and the Monks of <hi>Rome,</hi> than of the <hi>Bramines</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> or the <hi>Bonzians</hi> of <hi>Japan,</hi> or the <hi>Muphti</hi> of the <hi>Muſulmen.</hi> Whence comes ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50919:211"/>ſtrange a ſilence; ſo univerſal an obliviouſneſs? Is it that the thing was not worthy of the Apoſtles care and quill? But how can that be imagin'd, ſince, if you believe thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> it's upon theſe three orders, that Chriſtianity depends? For as to the Pope, he is the head of the Church, and exerciſeth ſo neceſſary an imperial power, that out of his communion, there is no ſalvation. And as for Prieſts, or Sacrificers, it's they alone that purifie the ſouls of men, both by the abſolution they give thoſe whom they confeſs, and by that Deity which they deliver unto ſuch as they communicate. Laſtly, as for Monks, their order is the ſtate of perfection: They are the Angels of the earth; the glory, and the rampart of the Church; the ſole patterns of Evangelick piety and ſanctity; wherefore they call their fraternities Religions, and diſdaining their old name of Monks, each ſex of them ſtiles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Religious; as if the piety of other Chriſtians did not deſerve to be called Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in compariſon of theirs. Whence comes it then, that the Apoſtles have ſo forgotten theſe three ſorts of people, which are as highly or more neceſſary in the Church, than the four elements in the world? Dear Brethren, you plainly ſee the reaſon; and if paſſion did not blind our adverſaries, they might ſee it too as well as we. The Apoſtles have ſaid nothing to theſe three ſorts of people, becauſe there were none ſuch among Chriſtians in their time. Had there been then a Pope and Sacrificers in the Church, the Apoſtles without doubt would have told them their duty, as well as Biſhops and Elders, (that is Paſtors.) And if there had been Monks and Religiouſes, they would undoubtedly have ſpoken unto them, as well as unto men and women that live in wedlock. Since they did it not, be we certainly aſſured, that neither of theſe three plants was ſown, or ſet by JESUS CHRIST, or His Apoſtles; but they have all ſprung up ſince their dayes, partly from the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, partly from the ſuperſtition and corruptneſs of men, who alſo affording them cultivation, have raiſed them by little and little to that prodigious greatneſs, which now for divers ages they have had. And this be ſpoken at the entrance, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the care the Apoſtles in general had, to form and regulate the duties of the divers conditions of perſons, which are found in the Church.</p>
                     <p>As for S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s particular in this place, he ſpeaks here, firſt, unto Husbands and Wives; next unto Fathers and Children; and laſt of all, unto Maſters and Servants; following therein the natural order of the things themſelves. For if you conſider the dignity of them, the union of Husband and Wife is the moſt excellent, and that upon which the others do depend; or if you regard their riſe; Man was an Husband, before a Father or a Maſter; GOD gave <hi>Adam</hi> a Wife before He gave him Children or Servants. Now though in this prime union, the Husband poſſeſſeth the firſt place; yet the Apoſtle beginneth at the Wife, and doth the like in the two following orders, inſtructing Children before Fathers; and Servants before Maſters; either for that the ſubjection to which Wives, and Children, and Servants are obliged, is more difficult and diſpleaſing to our nature, than the love and government of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and Fathers, and Maſters is: or for that the ſubjection of the one is the foundation upon which the others good government doth depend. We will handle at the preſent no more but the leſſon which he gives to Wives and Husbands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Text that you have heard, reſerving that which concerns Children and Fathers, Servants and Maſters, to another time.</p>
                     <p>The Wife's leſſon is for words ſhort; but for ſenſe of great weight, and large extent. <hi>Wives,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to them) <hi>be ſubject to your own Husbands; as is meet in the LORD.</hi> In which words, firſt, he commands Married women that ſubjection which they owe to their own Husbands; and next ſhews them the manner of that ſubjection; <hi>as is meet in the LORD.</hi> As for ſubjection, it's an order that GOD hath eſtabliſhed generally in all things, which conſtitute any kind of body, whether it be in nature, or in either Angelical or humane ſociety, that ſome ſhould depend on others. Thus you ſee in plants, the other parts depend upon the root and in animals upon the heart; and they all upon the ſoul that makes them live. Among men there's no eſtate without a ſuperiour that governs, and inferiours that are governed. In the compoſition of the world it ſelf, as it is one total, you know that earthly things depend upon the heavens, it's they that govern all the reſt: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any union, or any body, or natural compacted frame in the whole
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50919:212"/>univerſe, all whoſe parts are entirely equal. GOD, whoſe wiſdome is infinite, hath ſo ordered it, for the benefit of things themſelves; thoſe that are feeble, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, finding their perfection in the conduct of ſuch as are more perfect; and the more perfect reaping commodity and dignity from the ſubjection of thoſe that are leſs. This induced the Apoſtle to ſay in another place, that GOD is not a GOD of confuſion, or of diſorder, but of peace. Whence followeth, that to reſiſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection when perſons are called to it, is a thwarting of His will and a perturbing of His order: a mark alſo, not of fortitude and courage, but of folly and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to oppoſe it: conform to that which experience taught the Heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to obſerve, even that good men are eaſie to be governed; and that thoſe that moſt unwillingly endure a ſuperior, are alwaies ſuch as have leaſt worth. It having therefore pleaſed GOD, according to this general diſpoſition of His wiſdom, that in marriage, man ſhould be the head, it's with good reaſon, that the Apoſtle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>That word compriſeth all the duty of the condition to which GOD calleth them; and therefore the Holy Spirit uſeth it almoſt alwaies in this matter; as in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5.22. Tit. 2.5.</note> where theſe ſelf-ſame terms occur; and in the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus That</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they be diſcreet, chaſte, keepers at home, good, ſubject to their own husbands;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.1.</note> and in the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter; Ye wives</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to your own husbands.</hi> I know well the expreſſion doth diſpleaſe our nature, which, in the corruption that ſin hath brought upon it, hateth all, even the moſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubjection. And perhaps it is upon this accont, that the Apoſtles have ſo often recommended it to Chriſtian women, that they might inſtruct them to combat this ſentiment of our depraved nature, and ſubmit themſelves unto GOD's order. But certainly, ſetting aſide the word, and the diſorders which our ſin doth ſow in every condition, there is no harſhneſs in this conjugal ſubjection; there's nothing in it, but is ſweet, and beneficial, and advantageous both to the wife her ſelf, and alſo the whole family. For it's an error to think, that all ſubjection is hard, and vexatious. That which the body oweth to the ſoul, and the members to the head; that which the air and earth do render to the heavens, hath nothing of conſtraint, nothing ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it; on the contrary, 'tis in it, that the glory of the body, and the members, and the elements, does conſiſt. Among the Angels themſelves, whoſe being is full of perfection, and of glory, there wanteth not ſome kind of ſubjection, the inferior Angels having dependance upon their chiefs. And in the terreſtrial Paradiſe, if ſin had not baniſhed us thence, amid the delights and perfections of an happy ſtate, the wiſe would not have been exempt from being ſubject to her husband; an evident ſign, that this ſubjection is not incompatible, either with her felicity, or with her glory; and that all the bitterneſs now found in it, comes not from the thing it ſelf, but from ſin, which hath altered it, as it hath all the other parts of our life, and nature. For in reality, what does this ſubjection ſignifie, but a juſt and rational, a ſweet and amiable dependance of the wife upon the husband, like that of the body upon its head, or upon its ſoul?</p>
                     <p>Of this ſubjection, the firſt part, which is as the root and ſtock of all the reſt, is a ſenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ent, and diſpoſition of heart; when the wife acknowledgeth in her ſoul, that the husband GOD hath given her, is her head, and as the wiſe man ſaith, her guide; who, in the due order of their life, ought to have the firſt place; and that ſhe is inferior to him, ſince ſhe is his wife, whatever advantage ſhe hath other-waies above him, be it in wealth, or in nobility, yea, even in prudence, and abilites of ſpirit. If ſhe hath once ſetled this holy and reſpectful perſwaſion in her heart, ſhe will no more find ought of harſhneſs or difficulty in all that ſubjection which ſhe oweth her husband. This ſentiment alone is ſufficient to form her unto it, and bow without any violence all the actions of her life that way. And it's this, in my opinion,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.33.</note> that the Apoſtle meaneth, when he ſaith elſe where, that <hi>the wiſe ſhould reverence her husband.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6.</note> Such was the ſentiment of <hi>Sarah,</hi> whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth unto Chriſtian women, for a pattern of their demeanor.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50919:212"/>alſo the complacency ſhe ought to have for her husband, faſhioning her ſelf to his mind, and deveſting her own diſpoſition of all ſhe ſees offenſive to him, to put on his affections and manners in every thing, as far as piety and honeſty will permit; bending, and accommodating her inclinations and humours in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, unto her husbands, that ſhe may be as a faithful mirrour to him, wherein he may ſee his own image. This, you will ſay, is difficult. Sure it is ſo: But to ſuch as bear their husbands little reſpect, and love; and yet more difficult to thoſe that love them not at all. She that loves her husband ardently; that looks upon him as the head which GOD hath given her; as her weal, and her honour, and her glory; will eaſily diſcharge this duty; yea, take pleaſure in it; it being the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true love, to transform ſweetly, and without conſtraint, the perſon loving into the beloved.</p>
                     <p>In fine, this ſubjection comprehends in ſequel, the cares a wife ought to have of her husband's perſon and family; all which the Scripture compriſeth in two words, when it termeth her, <hi>an help,</hi> which GOD hath given him, <hi>like unto him,</hi> that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother himſelf. That ſhe love him conſtantly; be a conſolation to him in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and an augmentation of joy in proſperity; and as the Wiſe man hath it

That ſhe keep his houſe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly orders; govern his family,
<note place="margin">Tit. 2.4.</note> and hold all in it in good order; and in the end make account, that this is the buſineſs, to which GOD calleth her even to employ all her cares, all her labour and vigilance, to the contentment, to the welfare and honour of her husband; and that it is in this, her own glory and felicity doth conſiſt. Such is that conjugal ſubjection, which the wife oweth to her husband.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle, for the founding and the regulating of it, after his giving it in charge to Chriſtian women, addeth, <hi>as is meet in the LORD.</hi> I ſay in theſe words, he firſt foundeth that duty of ſubjection, which the wife oweth to her husband. For ſaying, that <hi>this is meet in the LORD,</hi> he ſheweth us, that the will of GOD is, this be performed; and that it is His order and inſtitution that the wife be ſubject to her husband. This receiveth evidence firſt from that particular which we learn from <hi>Moſes,</hi> even the LORD's ſaying expreſly to <hi>Eve,</hi> and in her to all women, <hi>Thy deſires ſhall refer unto thy husband, and he ſhall have dominion over thee.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3.16.</note> The order alſo, which he followed in the creation, manifeſtly proveth that this was His inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And it is for the ſame end too, that he formed <hi>Eve</hi> of one of the ribs of <hi>Adam:</hi> to ſhew namely, that the woman belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the man; that ſhe is his own, as being made and form'd of matter that was his; and that he hath title to her, and a right over her. <hi>S.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50919:213"/>from the fault which the woman committed, in lending ear to the Serpent, and upon it inducing her husband unto diſobedience.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.14.</note> 
                        <hi>It was not</hi> Adam (ſaith he) <hi>that was ſeduced: but the woman, having been ſeduced, was in the tranſgreſſion.</hi> For ſince they both ſped ſo ill, upon the husband's obeying of the wife; it is very reaſonable, that the wife reſume the firſt order, and without putting of the yoke any more, as ſhe did then, obey, and be ſubject unto him, whom ſhe did ſo unhappily undertake to govern, to the extreme miſery of the one and other of them.</p>
                     <p>But though all this be true and evident, yet I think the Apoſtle intends here ſomewhat more. For when he ordereth wives to be ſubject to their husbands, <hi>as is meet in the LORD,</hi> by the term LORD, he underſtands according to the ordinary ſtile of the New Teſtament, not GOD ſimply; but JESUS CHRIST; and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents unto them the honour they have of being in the communion of this Soveraign LORD, to put them on unto a faithful diſcharge of this duty. For though it be a thing of a bad grace, and contrary to the Laws of GOD, that the wife ſhould either aſſume ſuperiority over her husband, or however that be, refuſe him this juſt ſubjection; yet there is no State nor Religion in which it is more unſeemly, and leſs permitted than in the diſcipline of CHRIST; firſt, becauſe He hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and eſtabliſhed the dignity, and ſanctity, and indiſſoluble union of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtate, which this ſubjection appertains unto, much more clearly and excellently, than ever did any Lawgiver, not <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf excepted. Secondly, for as much as He hath far better, and much more perfectly formed than any other, all His diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in general, unto peace, and meekneſs, and humility; and women in particular unto that decency, and modeſty, and reſervedneſs, which is proper for their ſex; it is evident, that Chriſtian wives are much more obliged to the ſubjection we ſpeak of, which is a thing depending on thoſe vertues, than any other perſons of their ſex. Moreover the intereſt of their Religion requires this performance at their hands; though law and reaſon had not impos'd ſubjection on them; to the end it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by their obedience, that JESUS CHRIST doth not diſturb the juſt order of humane ſocieties; but on the contrary, form both men and women to all kind of righteouſneſs and honeſty, much more exactly and effectually than other Religions do. Laſtly, the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST having in divers places taken Marriage for a ſymbole of the union, which is between Him, and His Church, he hath by that uſage authorized and confirmed the duties of both the two Married parties, and particularly the ſubjection of the wife, ſince ſhe is the image of the Church, which ought to be ſubject unto CHRIST; a matter which the Apoſtle hath elſewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently made uſe of in this ſubject.
<note place="margin">Eph. 5, 23.24.</note> 
                        <hi>The Husband</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the bead of the Wife, even as CHRIST is the head of the Church.</hi> Therefore as the Church is ſubject unto CHRIST; ſo let wives be to their own husbands in all things. Thus you ſee with how much truth and wiſdom the Apoſtle here alledgeth unto Chriſtian women that <hi>it is meet in the LORD,</hi> (that is, in JESUS CHRIST) they ſhould be ſubject to their husbands; it being clear by all we have been ſaying, that all the conſiderations of the diſcipline of this ſame LORD, and of the communion they have with Him, do ſo ſtrictly oblige them to this duty, that if they fail of performance, beſide the fault and the diſorder which they commit againſt the Law and inſtitution of GOD and nature, they alſo particularly offend the LORD JESUS, and outrage the myſteries of His Goſpel, and ſcandalize His people.</p>
                     <p>But I have ſaid, that the Apoſtle does alſo by theſe words regulate and limit that ſubjection which the wife oweth her Husband. For adding to the reſt that in the LORD, or according to the LORD, he evidently ſheweth that it reacheth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to ſuch things as do not offend JESUS CHRIST. She is ſubject to her husband (I acknowledge) but in things wherein ſhe is not rebellious againſt GOD. She ought to pleaſe him; but on condition ſhe diſpleaſe not their common LORD. She owes him her obedience, and her aſſiſtance, and her ſervice in adverſity, and in all the troubles of houſhold affairs; but not in ſin. The will of JESUS CHRIST is the true boundary of her ſubjection and complacency. She ought to put on ſo far; but further ſhe may not paſs, without perriſhing. Whatever tye we have to any creature, it ſtill leaves the rights of GOD entire; becauſe our obligation unto Him is the firſt and moſt ancient, the ſtricteſt and moſt neceſſary of all, that we are under.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50919:213"/>And if the Husband pretend to oblige his Wife, or the Father his Child, or the Prince his Subject, unto any violation of the commands of GOD, that is, either to do what He forbids, or not to do what He injoyns;
<note place="margin">Acts 5.29. Luke 14.26. Matt. 10.37.</note> in this caſe the faithful ſoul is to remember, that <hi>we ought to obey GOD, rather than men;</hi> and that <hi>if we love father or mother, husband or wife, children, or brethren or ſiſters, or even our own lives more than CHRIST, we are not worthy of Him, nor can be His diſciples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But having thus heard the leſſon which the Apoſtle gives the wife, let us now hearken unto that he gives the husband. <hi>Husbands,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>love your Wives, and be not bitter againſt them.</hi> He commands 'em to love them; and forbids 'em to be bitter againſt them: and in theſe few words compriſeth all their duty. This duty is no whit leſs juſt; but indeed more ſweet and pleaſing than that which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the wives. And obſerve, I pray the Apoſtles prudence. For when he had allotted the woman ſubjection for her ſhare, conſequence ſeemed to require that he ſhould give the man, command and government for his. But he doth it not. He eſtabliſhed the man's authority ſufficiently, by putting the woman in ſubjection to him; and for the moſt part his ſtrength and the other advantages of his ſex, do cauſe him to aſſume but too much. Wherefore in ſtead of ſaying, Husbands govern your wives, or command them, or of uſing ſome ſuch word, importing authority, he ſaith unto them, <hi>Love your wives;</hi> to ſweeten on one hand the ſubjection of the wife; and to temper on the other hand the authority of the husband. Wife, let not your ſubjection fright you; the Apoſtle ſubjects you not, but to a perſon who loves you. Husband, let not your authority make you inſolent. If the Apoſtle ſubject your wife unto you, it's only to the end you love her. Derive no vanity, either the one or the other of you from the advantages he gives you. If the love which the husband owes his wife make her haughty; let her remember, that withall ſhe is ſubject unto him that loves her. And if the authority which GOD giveth the husband, flatter him; let him not forget that the wife is not ſubmitted to him, but for the obliging him to love her the more.</p>
                     <p>Further, this love which the Apoſtle would have husbands bear their wives, is a ſacred and ſincere affection; produced in their hearts, not ſimply by that pleaſing form, and that grace and ſweetneſs which naturally makes men love and ſeek unto this ſex, and which, how perfect and charming ſoever it may be, is at moſt but a flower of a very ſhort and uncertain duration: but principally by the will of GOD, who hath joyned them with 'em; who hath given them to them for companions in their good and bad fortunes; for helps in all the parts of their life, for a perpetuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their name and lineage; for the diminiſhing of their troubles, and the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of their joyes. This perpetual and indiviſible union which bindeth them together, and which of two perſons hath changed them into one fleſh; which hath mingled together all their intereſts; and in their dear Children, inſeparably combined, and confounded their blood and very nature; all this I ſay, muſt kindle in the foul of husbands, a pure and an inviolable love unto their wives: then again, this love muſt flow forth from the heart into the external actions, diſcovering and evidencing its ſelf, by ſuch continual effects, as may be truly worthy of it. For love is not a dead picture, nor a vain phantaſie, nor an idol without life and action. It's the livelieſt, and moſt active of all our ſentiments. It's a will that affecteth, and ſets all the power one hath on work to procure ſome good to the perſon whom it loveth. The firſt effect of this love is to be pleaſed in the preſence of that which a man loves; and not be able to ſuffer the abſence of it long, without diſquiet. The ſecond, to communicate to it all a man poſſeſſeth, that is good; and the third to guard and preſerve it from all incommodity and moleſtation.</p>
                     <p>It's thus the Apoſtle would have husbands love their wives, even Firſt, that they live ordinarily with them, as far as the neceſſity of their affairs permits; not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſweeter divertiſement, nor more pleaſing company any other where. Then next, that they carefully make them partakers of the graces GOD hath given them: and principally, in all that concerns the ſalvation of their ſouls; which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good of all; faithfully directing them about it both by good and holy ſpeech, and alſo by pure and vertuous deportment. It's in this they ought to exerciſe that advantage which nature and the Apoſtle gives them, ſhewing themſelves to be truly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50919:214"/>the heads and guides of their wives, in the matters of GOD's ſervice, and of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life; for this end making proviſion of all neceſſary knowledge; that if they at any time conſult them in their doubts,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.35.</note> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands, they may be able to inſtruct them; leaſt in defect of it, it might be ſaid of them as a Prophet ſometime ſaid of Idols,
<note place="margin">Hab. 2.18:</note> 
                        <hi>that they are teachers of nothing but vanity.</hi> But unto theſe cares for the ſoul, the husband ought to add thoſe alſo which reſpect the preſent life, labouring in his vocation, and imparting to his wife a ſhare of all the ſubſtance he poſſeſſeth, or acquireth, proportionably to her need of it, either for her own neceſſary food and raiment, or for the maintaining her children and family, as befits her condition. It's this the Apoſtle means, when he commandeth husbands to love their wives.</p>
                     <p>But he forbids them in the following words, <hi>to be bitter againſt them;</hi> that is, to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>roward to them; requiring that all their converſation with them be full of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and amity. The Pagans themſelves have obſerv'd the juſtneſs of this duty, as what we read of one piece of their devotions beareth witneſs. For when they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed unto that idol of theirs, whom they call'd Nuptial <hi>Juno,</hi> becauſe they gave her the ſuperintendency of Marriage, they were wont to take the gall out of the victim, and caſt it behind the altar; ſignifying thereby (as ſay the interpreters of their Ceremonies) that there ought to be no gall nor bitterneſs in marriage. The Apoſtles meaning then is, that the husband do firſt purge his heart of all this ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and bitterneſs; that he never ſuffer hatred, nor malevolence, nor anger, nor provocation, nor fretting, nor diſguſt to enter there againſt a perſon whom he ought to love as himſelf. Next, he would have the husband clenſe all his words and actions from the ſame poiſon. For if he, who is angry with his neighbour without cauſe, and gives him the leaſt reviling word, doth deſerve torment, as our Saviour decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; of what hells is not he worthy; who outrageth his own fleſh? Her, whom he ought to cheriſh and tenderly affect, as CHRIST doth His Church? But if the Apoſtle command a Chriſtian to uſe no offenſive or opprobrious ſpeech againſt his wife; he doth as little permit him to ſhew bitterneſs of ſpirit by an angry, ſad, and obſtinate ſilence; which is no leſs provocative, nor leſs ſharp, to ſay truth, than the moſt outragious reproaches. In concluſion, by this clauſe, the Apoſtle does further, and with greater force of reaſon, baniſh out of conjugal converſe the cruelty, and rigour, and tyrannie of thoſe boyſterous, barbarous husbands, who treat their wives as bond-ſervants, denying them that ſhare which the laws of GOD and man do give them, in the government and adminiſtration of the houſhold. And the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt degree of this inhumanity is, when unto revilings and contempt, they add blows, and exceſſes of hand; an outrage, which the authors of the Roman Civil Law thought ſo unworthy of the conjugal alliance, that they permit the wife ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt, to break with her husband, approving, and authorizing her divorce, if ſhe can prove he ſtruck her.</p>
                     <p>Thus, Dear Brethren, you have heard what we had to deliver for the expoſition of this Text. It teacheth us all in general, firſt, that all ſorts of people may, and ought to read St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, and by conſequent, all the holy Scriptures: For why ſhould this holy man addreſs his ſpeech here to wives, and their husbands; to children, and their fathers; to ſervants, and their maſters, if he meant not, that all theſe perſons ſhould have the reading of this letter? Chriſtians, fear not to read what the Apoſtle hath vouchſafed to write you. It's in vain that ſome forbid you the reading, which it is his mind you ſhould practiſe; None can know better than he, how thoſe Epiſtles muſt be uſed which he wrote. Then again he ſhews us further here, how unjuſt the indiſcretion of thoſe is, who have ſo ill treated the worthineſs of marriage, that by their manner of ſpeaking of it, you would ſay, they held it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with Chriſtian purity. St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth every where maintain the honour of this holy order, and never prohibit, or diſparage it at all. Alſo, as the precepts which he gives to Maſters, to Paſtors, and others, do clearly authorize the right, and the dignity of thoſe conditions; ſo is marriage eſtabliſhed by the leſſon he writes here, and often elſe-where, unto married perſons. But the Devil knowing well, that this holy inſtitution of GOD is infinitely profitable unto men, both to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from tentations to incontinence, one of the broadeſt waies to Hell, and alſo to ſweeten the harſhneſs of their natures, by the tenderneſs of conjugal and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50919:214"/>affections, and for divers other ends, of great importance unto civil life, and unto piety it ſelf; the enemie, I ſay, not ignorant hereof, hath ſubtilly made hatred, or contempt of marriage, to inſinuate its ſelf into the ſpirits of a ſort of men, under divers plauſible pretexts; ſo as in concluſion, Chriſtians (who would think it?) have aſſerted it a piece of ſanctification to abſtain from it, and in the ſequel prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to the Miniſters of Religion. For our parts, Beloved Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>thren, we conſtrain none to marry. If any have received this grace of GOD, that they can contain, and live pure, out of this eſtate, let them forbear it, if it ſeem them good. Only we ſay two things; firſt, that the making uſe of it is free to all; there being no digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor profeſſion in the Church, excluded from Divine permiſſion of it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that to ſuch as have not the gift of continency, marriage is not only permitted, but even neceſſary; and of whatever rank they be, their marrying is ſo far from offending GOD, that they offend Him much, if they marry not.</p>
                     <p>Hereto, for a concluſion, we adjoyn a ſerious exhortation to all who are in this eſtate, that they ſedulouſly put in practiſe the leſſon which St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath now given them. Even that wives be ſubject to their husbands, as is meet in the LORD; that Husbands love their wives, and not be bitter againſt them. Many complain of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorns in this condition, inſtead of the roſes they hoped for. Men charge it upon the pride, the levity, the vanity, the gorgeouſneſs, the frowardneſs, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, and the tongues of their wives, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay many other odious reproaches upon them. Women, on the contrary, impute all this miſchief to the husbands; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, ſome of their contempt, and want of love; others, of their niggardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards them, and profuſeneſs other-waies. Some declaim againſt their idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the little care they take of their affairs; others againſt their exceſſes, and compotations. There are ſome that are angry at their ſpeaking, and others at their ſilence: and in fine, they forget not one ill treatment which they have received. I know well, that upon ſtrict examination, ſome fault would be found on each hand, and that if cauſe appear to reprehend wives, there would be no leſs to cenſure huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. But I had rather lay aſide all this vexatious proceſs; and do conjure you, Dear Brethren, and Siſters, in the name of GOD, to do the like; ſparing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers honour, conſider what you are, and what an union GOD hath call'd you to; and each one for his part acknowledging your defects in the duty it requireth, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate all your complaints in a reciprocal pardon; and forgetting all that is paſs'd, endeavour to procure to one another in the eſtate you are, that peace and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which hitherto you have not had. Do what the Apoſtle bids you, and you ſhall find as much ſweetneſs, as heretofore you have taſted bitterneſs. For as there is nothing more wretched, than a marriage in which the wife hath no reſpect for her husband, and the husband no love for his wife. So neither is there any thing in the world more happy, than a marriage, in which the wife, by an humble and reſpectful ſubmiſſion, and the husband, by a ſincere, and faithful love, have their hearts and wills united in an holy concord. As the firſt of theſe two conditions is an hell, ſo the ſecond is a very Paradiſe.</p>
                     <p>In fine, My Brethren, ſince JESUS CHRIST is the Spouſe of all faithful ſouls, you ſee what ſervice and ſubmiſſion we are obliged to render Him. May it pleaſe this Divine Spouſe, from that nuptial palace where he dwelleth, to make us ſmell the odour of His myſtical perfumes, and to form our ſouls unto all the obedience, the fidelity, and ſervitude we owe him, and govern us by His Spirit, as He hath purchaſed us with His blood; that after having here beneath ſighed for Him, we may one day eternally enjoy Him, according to His promiſes, and our hopes. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; Among all the mutual offices, by which the ſociety of men is conſerved, thoſe incumbent on Children towards their parents, and on parents towards their children, are without doubt of the firſt rate, and moſt neceſſary. It's upon them, that all the reſt do in ſome ſort depend, and they are in humane ſociety what the foundation is in an edifice; the foundation once demoliſhed, all the building goes to ground; ſo the ſubjection of children, and the ſuperiority of parents once remov'd or unfixed, the ruine of all other parts of ſociety does neceſſarily follow. For if a man neglect his children, or miſgovern them, how will he duly and inhumanely treat ſervants, or ſubjects, or any other perſons, whomſoever? Again, if a child ſhake off the yoke of his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how will he bear that of a Maſter, or a Prince? There is no likelyhood that the one or the other, having fail'd in offices ſo ſweet and natural toward perſons that are ſo nearly in conjunction with them, will ever rightly diſcharge any of thoſe other, which they owe to perſons more remote, and with whom they have much leſs union. Whence appears the admirable wiſdom of the Providence of GOD, who for the forming of us unto the devoirs of love, ſubjection, and obedience, which are neceſſary in the Civil, or Eccleſiaſtique ſociety we are to live in, puts us at firſt into the boſom, and under the conduct of our Fathers and Mothers, that there as in a ſweet and a commodious School, we may timely learn the bending of our ſpirits unto love, and reſpect for men; and after this previous apprentiſhip, find the yoke of thoſe ſuperiours, under whom we are to live in Church or State, leſs uneaſie. For one that hath been a good child in the houſe, will without much trouble,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50919:215"/>be a good ſubject in the State; and likewiſe he that is a good Father will eaſily prove alſo a good Maſter, a good Magiſtrate, a good Paſtor, if GOD call him to either of thoſe charges. Wherefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> requires, among the other qualifications of a Biſhop or Paſtor, <hi>that he rule well his own houſe, having his children inſubjection with all reverence. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if a man know not how to order his own houſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim 3.4.5.</note> 
                        <hi>how ſhall he govern the Church of GOD?</hi> Theſe reciprocal duties therefore of parents, and of children being of ſo great importance in the whole life of men, it's with good reaſon, that our Apoſtle takes care to regulate them in the Text which we have read; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after having in the precedent Verſe, formed thoſe of Husband and Wife. He ſpeaks firſt to children, according to the general order of beginning with the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, which he obſerves in all this part of his inſtitution, for reaſons we pointed at in our laſt action. <hi>Children</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>obey your Fathers and Mothers in all things; for this is pleaſing to the LORD.</hi> Then he preſcribes to Fathers alſo, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to them, in theſe words. <hi>Fathers, provoke not your children, leſt they be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi> Theſe are the two heads we will treat of in the preſent action, if GOD ſo pleaſe; Firſt, the duty of children; and Secondly, that of Fathers.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt of theſe, we are to conſider the Apoſtle's command, contained in thoſe words, <hi>Children, obey your Parents in all things;</hi> and then the reaſon of this command, which the Apoſtle annexeth, when he ſaith, <hi>For this is pleaſing to the LORD.</hi> He directeth the command to children, and uſeth here, in the original, a term, that ſignifyeth any perſon begotten of another, his fruit, his production; a term, that conſequently comprehendeth all children, of which ſoever ſex, that is, both ſons and daughters; and of whatſoever degree, that is, grandſons in regard of their grandfathers, as well as ſons in regard of their fathers; For the word [Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren] according to the ſenſe and authority both of Scripture, and of the learned in the laws, doth encloſe the one and the other. Let all thoſe therefore, to whom this title doth belong, make account, that to them is this injunction of the Apoſtles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed. Let not daughters object the weakneſs of their ſex; nor ſons the ſtrength and excellency of theirs, to be diſpenced with for the obedience they owe; ſince the difference of their ſexes doth not hinder, but that they are equally children. Nay, the weakneſs of maids, is ſo far from diminiſhing, that it ſtrengthens their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that it renders the conduct of thoſe who brought them into the world, ſo much the more neceſſary for them, as they are of themſelves more infirm: and the fitter young mens ſtrength makes them to ſerve their Fathers, and their Mothers, ſo much the more do they owe them obedience. Tell me not, that time, or fortune, as they call it, hath freed you from this ſubjection; whatever years you have attained to, and whatever degree or honour ye poſſeſs, you remain unalterably your Fathers and your Mothers children; ſo that ſince it is unto this name, the Apoſtle affixeth the obligation you have to obey them, it's evident that there is neither age, nor Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that can, or ſhould give you a diſpenſation for it. The Scripture ſets before us an eminent example of it in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who, though of ripe years, and the father of a family, and a great LORD in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he was the ſecond perſon in the State; yet all this made him not forget that he was <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſon;
<note place="margin">Gen. 46.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> and when he knew him to be come into the Countrey, he went preſently to meet him; his dignity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him not from rendring this honour to his Father. He bowed down his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before him, and notwithſtanding the extreme inequality of their conditions in the world, reſpected him alwaies as his Father.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſee what that duty is which the Apoſtle here commandeth children to perform. [<hi>Obey</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your Fathers and your Mothers in all things.</hi>] The Law of GOD uſeth the term, honour. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> But all comes to one. For ſure it is, that under this honour which the Legiſlator injoyneth, juſt obedience alſo is compriſed; and in like manner, under the obedience which St. <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth, is that reſpect, which is one of the principal ſources of it, underſtood and preſuppoſed. Only it may be noted, that perhaps he choſe the word <hi>obey,</hi> the more effectually to ſhew us, what that honour is which we owe our Fathers and our Mothers; that it is not a vain reſpect which conſiſteth meerly in countenances, and in ceremonies; but a true and real reverence, accompanied with obedience, ſo as to execute readily and chearfully what they order us to do, learn what they teach us,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50919:216"/>correct what they diſlike, and forbear what they forbid us. And hereby is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the hypocriſie of thoſe, who give their parents reſpects and civilities enough, as to words and geſtures; but at the bottom, take no pain to do any thing they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of them.
<note place="margin">Mat. 21.30.</note> Like that mocker in the parable, who having promiſed his Father to go and labour in his Vineyard, yet went not.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle to anticipate the vain pretexts which impiety does inſpire ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with, ordereth children, not ſimply, to obey their parents, but to obey them in all things; extending their authority to an infinity; nor ſhutting up within any bounds that power which GOD and nature have given them to comand the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they have brought into the world. Why then? you will ſay, is it true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that Fathers and Mothers have ſo vaſt and immenſe an Authority; and that their Children, whom GOD hath created reaſonable, are obliged notwithſtanding this advantage to obey all their commands, how harſh ſoever, and contrary to the light of their judgment they be? Dear Brethren, if you conſider the thing in its ſelf, according to its own nature, and the terms of its firſt inſtitution, it is very true, that the authority of Parents is ſo great, as Children are indeed obliged to obey them generally, and without exception, in all things they command them. Nor doth this diſagree with that advantage of reaſon, wherewith GOD hath honoured chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For if things had continued in their due order, Fathers would command their children nothing that were contrary to right reaſon. Now I confeſs, ſin hath diſturb'd this order, and it oft happens that ſuch as are Fathers do command their children unjuſt things; yet neither can it be deny'd, but that in this caſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from the quality of Fathers, and become Tyrants. For the name of Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving in it an unfeigned love of the child, a love deſirous of his good, and moſt remote from all that's contrary to his welfare; it is evidently a renouncing of this quality, when a man would oblige him to things that are evil, and incompatible with the duties of a reaſonable creature. It's therefore this abuſe, and this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nature brought in by ſin, that hath bounded the paternal power which of its ſelf, continuing in its right uſe, would be abſolute; it's this that hath obliged both Divine and Humane Laws to annex unto it certain juſt and reaſonable excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which the Apoſtle in another place; where he treats of the ſame ſubject, hath compriſed all in one word.
<note place="margin">Eph. 6.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Children</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>obey your Parents in the LORD;</hi> that is, as far as you may without diſobeying the Soveraign LORD, both theirs and yours: as far as their commands thwart not GOD's orders; and the words he addeth in the Text it ſelf do neceſſarily lead us thereto. <hi>Obey them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in all things; for this is pleaſing to the LORD;</hi> an addition, that evidently reſtraineth the obedience of children to that which is pleaſing unto GOD; ſo as if the Father happen to command what diſpleaſeth GOD, the child is obliged by all kind of rights to regard more the will of GOD, than the will of man; This maxim remaining firm and immoveable, that whatever we owe to an inferiour and ſubalternate power, the rights of the ſuperiour and ſoveraign muſt ſtill remain entire. For ſince it is GOD, who gave the father himſelf all the authority he hath, it is clear that he hath none againſt GOD; but that as the child ought to obey him, ſo he ought to obey GOD. When he doth it not; but by an unſufferable felony caſts off the yoke of this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, to whom both he and we do owe infinitely more obedience, than to all the men on earth, it is juſt to deny him that obedience which he gives not to GOD; it is juſt, that of two contrary commands, the one of GOD, the other of a man, we do prefer the Divine, before that which is humane. As if a Father ſhould command his Son to be an Idolater, or to kill or to hate his Neighbour; or ſhould forbid him to embrace the ſervice of GOD, or to make profeſſion of the Goſpel of His CHRIST<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in theſe caſes, and other ſuch as theſe, diſobedience would be juſt, and obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs criminal. And hereto properly doth that ſaying of our LORD and Saviour refer;
<note place="margin">Luke 14.26.</note> 
                        <hi>If any man come unto me, and hateth not his Father, and his Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, and even his life it ſelf;</hi> (that is, as another Evangeliſt expounds it,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> if he love theſe more than me) <hi>he is not worthy of me; he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saving this juſt and reaſonable exception, children owe their fathers that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in all things which the Apoſtle here enjoyns them. And firſt in thoſe which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50919:216"/>are of themſeves good and holy, and conform to the Divine will; beſide that the Law of GOD obligeth us all to them, the command of a Father doth moreover oblige anew his children; and if they fail in it, beſide the crime, they thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit againſt GOD; they commit another againſt paternal authority, which ſhall be charged on them, and puniſhed apart, as a different ſin, and worthy of its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular penalty. Secondly, the child again owes obedience in medial, and indifferent things, that is, things which are morally neither good nor evil, the extent whereof is very great. Though ſuch things be free of their own nature, yet they are ſo no more unto a child after the father's order. His command draws them forth of that indifferency, in which they lay, and renders them neceſſary in reference to him. And here muſt no ſelf-flattery take place. I wiſh, (and it is their duty, as we ſhall hear anon) that Fathers would command nothing, but what is humane and equitable: yet if they forget themſelves, and paſs theſe bounds, how harſh and troubleſome ſoever their commands be, obey'd they muſt be; if they contain in them nothing impious, or contrary to the Divine Law; according to the expreſs order, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> giveth Servants to be ſubject to their Maſters, not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward. The reaſon for children in reference to their fathers is the ſame in this behalf, with that for ſervants in reference to their Maſters You ſee then, Beloved Brethren, the juſt extent of all thoſe things, in which the Apoſtle, would have children obey their Parents.</p>
                     <p>Whence appears, how unrighteous, and dangerous, and contrary to the Word of GOD, the Doctrine of thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> is, who enfranchiſe all Chriſtian children from this paternal authority and power, daughters at twelve, and ſons at fourteen, giving them liberty at theſe ſo green years of age, to go from their parents houſe, will they, nill they, and retire from under their obedience into the cloyſters of their monaſteries; where they have erected an aſſured ſanctuary, and an inviolable ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the rebellion of children againſt their fathers, and their mothers. There under the umbrage of a falſe devotion, they entertain children in idleneſs, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their impiety, tyrannically giving them a diſpenſation for that obedience, and thoſe juſt ſuccours, which by all the laws of GOD, and men, they owe to the ſacred perſons of thoſe who gave them being in the world The father demands of 'em the aſſiſtances and conſolations which he promiſed himſelf from them. He ſheweth them his gray hairs, and his limbs, trembling through age; he conjures them, by the life he gave them, and by the cares he took to breed them up. He ſummons them to render him the juſt rewards of his pains; and not to deſpiſe the tears, and treaties of a perſon to whom they are obliged for their life. The mother all in mourning preſents them the paps that nurſed them, and ſets before their eyes the tenderneſs of her affection, and all the tyes of nature. And they both together ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ them before GOD, that they may ſee themſelves condemned at His dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tribunal, to pay the honour which they owe them. What ſay our adverſaries hereupon? They ſay, that children ought to look upon their fathers, and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without emotion. That neither their words, nor their weeping, ſhould make any impreſſion upon them. That if they cannot enter into the monaſtery other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, than treading their bodies under foot, they ought to have no horrour at all, at ſo unnatural an action. That it is piety, to be cruel and inſenſible on ſuch an occaſion. They ſay, the monaſtick vow hath broken all the bonds of filial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; and that the child who hath made it, does no longer owe any thing to father or mother; that he is dead to them, and they have no more power over him; no more, than if he were out of the world.</p>
                     <p>Oh unrighteous, and cruel, and unnatural doctrine! How could theſe men more plainly contradict the holy Apoſtle? The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is pleaſing to the LORD.</hi> And theſe Maſters ſay, Children, obey them not in all things; if they forbid you to be Monks, ſcorn their Order. It they command you to abide with them, be gone againſt their will. For you would do a thing diſpleaſing to the LORD, if you did not diſobey them. Neither let them alledge us here, that they are now grown up. If they ceaſe to be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by attaining unto twelve or fourteen years, I will acknowledge, that they are no longer ſubject to their parents. But if they muſt confeſs, that no age does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50919:217"/>them of this quality, it muſt be acknowledged, that neither does any give them a diſpenſation for obedience; ſince the Apoſtle commands it to all ſuch as are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. They excuſe themſelves upon the account of devotion. This would paſs, if the father called his child unto impiety; or commanded him to deny JESUS CHRIST, or to ſerve idols. But this father, and this mother, who would keep their child at home, are Chriſtians, as well as Monks are; and their houſe makes a part of JESUS CHRIST's, as well as the Cloyſter where he is kept in. The obedience they demand of him, is a duty commanded by the Law of GOD; and very far from being contrary thereto. I urge not at preſent, that the vows by which he is pretended to be bound, are contrary to the word of GOD; as particularly, that of mendicancy; are raſh, as that of never marrying; are injurious to the LORD, as that of the blind and abſolute obedience which they promiſe to a mortal man. Let them go for permitted. Certainly at leaſt, are they not neceſſary; and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as great admirers of them as they are, do confeſs, (I take it) that one may ſerve GOD, and obtain His kingdom, without the precinct of a monaſtery: and that neither beggery, nor ſingle lite, nor the frock, are things abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation. There is neither place where one may not ſerve JESUS CHRIST in ſpirit, and in truth; nor habit, but is compatible with piety. Now the child ought to obey his father in all that GOD hath not prohibited. Since then He hath not prohibited the living abroad out of the houſes and habit of <hi>Benedict,</hi> of <hi>Francis,</hi> of <hi>Loyola,</hi> and ſuch other inſtitutors of monaſtick life; every child is neceſſarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged not to enter into them, when his father forbids it him. But (you will ſay) what if he hath made a vow to enter? If he hath, he hath done ill againſt the dues of piety, and charity; and ſuch vows, if it be an error to make them, it is blindneſs, and obduration to keep them. The firſt and moſt inviolable of our vows, is that which binds us to the obedience of GOD, and after Him, to the obedience of our Parents. If we have chanced, through imprudence, or other-waies, to tye up our ſelves elſe-where, we muſt ſpeedily break the bond, and make no ſcruple, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to break it, but to obſerve it. Beſide evident reaſon for it, and the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all wiſe men, who hold that vows made againſt moral duty, do not oblige, the word of GOD expreſly maketh this deciſion. <hi>If a woman</hi> (ſaith the Law) <hi>ſhall vow a vow unto the LORD,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Numb, 30.4.6.</note> 
                        <hi>and bind her ſelf by a bond, in her youth, being in her Father's houſe; if her Father diſallow her in the day he heareth it, not one of all her vows, nor of the bonds wherewith ſhe hath bound her ſoul, ſhall ſtand.</hi> Here you ſee, that vows, though in other reſpects good, and lawful, yet oblige not, if made by children of the family, without their fathers allowance. And this is yet more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly concluded from the Lawgiver's adding,
<note place="margin">Num. 30.7 8, 9.</note> that <hi>the vows of a married wife, diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by her husband, are null, and void;</hi> it being evident, that the authority of a Father over his child, is much greater, and more ſtrict than that of an husband over his wife.</p>
                     <p>And hither muſt that cenſure be referred, which our LORD and Saviour paſs'd upon the Phariſees; who, under colour of the religion of vows, did alſo annul the honouring of parents by their children, ſo expreſly commanded in the Law. Saith He,
<note place="margin">Matt 15.4, 5, 6.</note> GOD hath commanded, ſaying, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> And again, <hi>He that curſeth his Father or Mother, ſhall dye the death.</hi> But ye ſay, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſay to his Father, or his Mother, All that whereof thou mighteſt have profit by me, is a gift, or <hi>Corban,</hi> though he honour not his Father, or his Mother, ſhall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of GOD of none effect through your tradition. For the right underſtanding of this diſcourſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's, and of that tradition of the Phariſees, he oppoſeth; we are to know, that the Jewiſh Rabbies, as we learn by their own books, did, and ſtill do make a very great account of vows, holding the religion of them abſolutely inviolable. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they liſted in the rank of vows, not thoſe only which were legitimate, and conceiv'd in ſolemn manner, with terms of a full extent, as when one ſaid, I make a vow unto GOD, not to taſte wine, or ſtrong drink, during the ſpace of forty daies, and the like; but alſo all other words, in what form ſoever conceiv'd, and uttered, whether upon deliberation, or in choler, or otherwiſe, by which one devoted any thing whatever, were it expreſly or covertly: as for inſtance, if a man in a fit of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50919:217"/>choler, or in the trouble of a quarrel with his neighbour, came to ſay through indignation, Let me dye, if ever I do thee any ſervice; the Rabbines took this for a true vow; and accounted ſuch a man obliged in conſcience, never to do that perſon any ſervice, againſt whom he had uttered ſuch words. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Corban,</hi> that is, the ſacred gifts given to the Temple, were a thing which they eſteemed moſt inviolable, and the offerings there kept, might not be employed to any profane uſe, nor any private perſon put his hand into the treaſury for that end, upon pain of death; hence it comes, that to ſignifie the uſe of a thing, was totally interdicted unto any one, they ſaid, it was to him <hi>corban,</hi> that is, he was no more permitted to make uſe of it, than of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred gifts, which in their language were called by that name. When therefore it fell out, that a ſon, through diſtaſte, or anger at his Father, once came to ſay, All that of which you might have profit by me, is a gift, or <hi>corban;</hi> that is, you ſhall never be the better for me, or you ſhall never draw ſervice or profit from me, no more than from the <hi>corban;</hi> the Phariſees, and other Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, held, that ſuch a man was obliged by this vow of his, to do his Father no ſervice any more; and they judged him innocent, and blameleſs, though he never did him any, how preſſing ſoever the Father's neceſſity might be; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that the religion of a vow was above the natural obligation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren towards their fathers, and their mothers; which was in very deed, to annull the Law of GOD by their tradition, as our Saviour charged them, Judge, if thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> do not the ſame thing; diſpenſing with children for the obedience due to Parents, upon pretence of monaſtick vows, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and if by conſequent we have not all the reaſons in the world, to apply unto them what our LORD ſaid of the Phariſees, even that they make the commandment of GOD of none effect by their tradition.</p>
                     <p>Let us then lay aſide, ſince the LORD doth ſo injoyn it us, all humane inventions; and ſimply, and faithfully keep to the will of our Soveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as He hath declar'd it to us in His word. As alſo you ſee, that in the Text, it's the only reaſon the Apoſtle doth alledge, to oblige children to this duty. He might have urged the juſtice of the thing it ſelf; it being evident, that we owe reſpect and honour unto thoſe who gave us both life and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and if not all, at leaſt the greateſt part of whatſoever help and honour we poſſeſs, and underſtand. He might have argued from Nature, which hath engraven this law in the heart of animals themſelves; whom we ſee, eſpecially while they are little, to be ſubject to thoſe that brought them forth. He might have produced the cuſtome of all nations, even the leaſt civilized not excepted, who by their uſage, and ſome of them by their laws, have authorized the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of parents, as of ſacred perſons; and have noted (as is indeed very notable) that the Pagan, both Greeks, and Romans, made ſo great an account of this duty, as to give it the ſame name they gave unto the fearing, and worſhipping of GOD, calling not only devout, and religious perſons, but thoſe alſo pious, who were induſtrious to honour and to ſerve their Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; whence it came, they held, that exceſſes committed againſt Parents,

He alledgeth nothing, but the ſole will of GOD, as the beſt, and the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the moſt conſiderable of all reaſons. Children, obey your Fathers and your Mothers in all things. Why? Becauſe this (ſaith he) is well-pleaſing to the LORD. If you be a Chriſtian, this is ſufficient to perſwade you to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your Parents that obedience which the Apoſtle commands you. For how can you neglect what is pleaſing to that LORD upon whom depends all your Salvation? who hath been ſo good to you, as to redeem you from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perdition, by the death of His only Son; and to give you in Him, His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and His peace, and the aſſured hope of everlaſting life.</p>
                     <p>That this dutifulneſs of children towards their Parents, is well-pleaſing unto Him, beſide that, the Apoſtle (whoſe authority is irrefragable) does expreſly aſſert it here, the LORD Himſelf doth evidence divers waies; Firſt, by His
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50919:218"/>commandment, engraven by His own hand at the head of the ſecond table of the Law. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> Secondly, by the promiſe He annexeth thereunto, <hi>to prolong your daies upon the earth,</hi> if ye be diligent to diſcharge this duty. In the third place, by the puniſhments He threatens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to children diſobeying their Father and Mother, ordaining in the political laws of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut 21.18. Exod. 21.17. Lev. 20.9.</note> that they ſhould be publickly ſtoned by all the people of the City where they dwelt; and elſe-where, that they ſhould irremiſſibly put to death him, who curſed his Father or his Mother.

                        <note place="margin">Prov. 20.20. &amp; 30.17.</note> that <hi>the lamp of ſuch a man ſhall be put out into blackeſt darkneſs;</hi> and that <hi>the ravens of the valley ſhall pluck out, and the young eagles eat the eye of him that mocketh his Father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his Mother.</hi> In fine, the LORD's calling Himſelf our Father, and honouring us with the name of His children, that He might oblige us to ſerve Him, doth ſufficiently ſhew of what kind, and how holy and inviolable that obedience is, which we owe to parents.
<note place="margin">Mal. 1.6.</note> 
                        <hi>If I be a Father</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>where is my Honour?</hi> Not ſo much as Pagans, but have acknowledged, that the performance of this duty is well-pleaſing to the Deity: witneſs ſome of their Poets confidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing a long and happy life to ſuch as ſhall honour their Fathers and their Mothers; and pay thoſe juſt diligences to their old age, which are due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                     <p>But it is time to come to the other head of the Text, wherein the Apoſtle, after his having reduced children to their duty, turns him unto Fathers, and adviſeth them to uſe the power he hath given them, moderately, and in ſuch manner, as their conduct may not tend but to their childrens benefit, and their own contentment. <hi>Fathers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>provoke not your children, leſt they be diſcouraged.</hi> This provocation which he forbids, is an ill effect, which the abuſe of paternal authority produceth in the hearts of children; when fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers exceed in rigour, and treat them too roughly; which comes to paſs a great many waies. Firſt, when they deny them a juſt allowance, and what is neceſſary to accommodate them according to their birth. The Apoſtle hath judged this ſo enormous a ſin,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.8.</note> that he ſticks not to ſay, that <hi>he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it, hath denied the faith, and is worſe than an infidel.</hi> Secondly, Fathers provoke their children, when they give them unrighteous, and inhumane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 20.30.</note> as when <hi>Saul</hi> would needs oblige <hi>Jonathan</hi> his ſon, to hate, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute <hi>David,</hi> a very virtuous, and innocent perſon: whereupon enſued, that this generous ſon, moſt unworthy of ſo bad a Father, was vexed, and inflamed with deſpight and anger. If the daughter of <hi>Herodias</hi> had had any ſparkle of this good nature, ſhe would have been in like manner offended at that cruel and barbarous command her mother made her,
<note place="margin">Mat. 14.8.</note> to ask of King <hi>Herod</hi> the head of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt in a Charger. 'Tis alſo the provoking of a child, when he ſhall, without any neceſſity, be compelled unto ſordid, and ſervile actions, and ſuch as are beneath his birth. In this rank too I put thoſe, who without cauſe do beat their childrens ears with contumelious words, whether preſent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion does inſpire them, or an ill-favoured cuſtome hath habituated their tongues to ſo venomous a ſtile. For we ſee ſome that cannot ſpeak unto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor reprove them, nor ſo much as call them to 'em, in any other dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; but diſcharge at every turn an hail-ſhower of maledictions, and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious terms upon them. A kind of carriage, as abject, and odious as may be, extremely unworthy of any honeſt and ingenious man, eſpecially of a Chriſtian, whoſe mouth ought to be a ſource of bleſſing, and have nothing iſſue from it, but what is grave, and holy, and proper to edifie. But neither is there any perſon with whom a wiſe man ſhould leſs deal in that manner, than his child; whom ſuch indiſcretion doth deject, and infinitely diſmay, if he hath ever ſo little ſpirit, and ſenſibility. It was with this black, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quant ſalt, that <hi>Saul</hi> did ſeaſon the remonſtrances he made to his <hi>Jonathan. Thou ſon</hi> (ſaith he to him) <hi>of a perverſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 20.30.</note> 
                        <hi>rebellious woman, do I not know, that thou haſt choſen the ſon of</hi> Jeſſe <hi>to thine own confuſion, and to the confuſion of thy Mothers nakedneſs?</hi> Are theſe the words of a Father? and not rather of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50919:218"/>yea, of a barbarous enemy, that hath neither honour nor civility? As indeed it was choler that ſpake, and not reaſon; And he ſuffered himſelf to be ſo tranſported by the fury of his paſſion, that after ſuch a tempeſt of rude words, he failed not to throw his lightning, caſting a javelin at him (as the Scripture relateth it) to ſmite him. And this is the height of thoſe exceſſes, which the Apoſtle intends here by that provoking, which he forbids; when fathers cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe their children, either without cauſe, or without meaſure, and beyond what they deſerve. For if juſtice oblige us to keep our minds free, and compoſed in puniſhing the greateſt ſtrangers, and the heynouſeſt malefactors, that we may exactly proportion the penalty to their faults,
<note place="margin">Den</note> as the LORD expreſly commanded the Judges of His people: how much more ſhould a Father, whoſe name breaths nothing but benignity, and ſweetneſs, obſerve the ſame modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when his buſineſs is to chaſten his child? GOD gives us example of it in His treatment of His children, chaſtiſing them in very deed, but as Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſays, with the rod of men, and with the ſtripes of the children of men,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.</note> that is, moderately, and with an humane rod, a rod tempered with gentleneſs and benignity.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle, to take off Fathers from this fault, ſhews them the evil that comes of it. <hi>Provoke not your children,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>leſt they be diſcouraged.</hi> For there is nothing that doth more deject the heart of a child, eſpecially if inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, than this rigour and roughneſs of a Father. Firſt, it ſaddens him, when in the countenance and actions of that perſon, to whom of all men in the world he ſhould in reaſon be deareſt, he ſees nothing but anger, and averſion. This grief doth often caſt him into languiſhings, and mortal maladies, which make Fathers regret, and execrate, though vainly, and too late, their unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and imprudent ſeverity: Then again, this kind of carriage intimidateth children, and depriveth them of all courage for any good and honeſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; and ſmothereth in them all the fire and vivacity they had. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves ſtill put back by their own Fathers, what can they hope for from other hands? Some, which is yet worſe, are by this means hardened, and together with ſenſibility, and nature, do loſe all ſhame, and modeſty, and fall at laſt by little and little into deſperate impiety, no longer making any account of GOD, or men, which is the utmoſt, and horrid'ſt degree of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Conſider, if the fear of ſo great a miſchief, do not oblige all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have any remainder, I will not ſay of piety, but even of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and good ſenſe, to take heed, that they provoke not their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, I beſeech you, improve now this inſtruction of the Apoſtles. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to whom firſt he addreſſeth his diſcourſe, render ye to your Fathers and Mothers in all things, the obedience he commands you. Remember the life they gave you; the pains they have taken to preſerve it to you; the cares they have had to adorn, and enrich it, both with neceſſary knowledges, and with conveniences requiſite for the happy paſſing of it; the fears, and tears they have been, and at every turn are ſtill in for you; their patience in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the weakneſſes of your infancy, and the extravagancies of your youth; the tenderneſs and conſtancy of the love they bear you, a love ſo great, ſo ardent, that you are the principal object of their deſires; that they preferr your contentment before their own, and toil not but for you, and have you night and day in their hearts; the vows wherewith they follow you every where, craving nothing of GOD more inſtantly, than your advancement and happineſs; and looking on you as the principal ſubject of their hopes, and of their joy. Have not ſo unnatural a ſoul, as not to reſent all theſe ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligations which you have to love, and ſerve, and honour them. Pay their love with your reſpects; and their pains with your obedience; and be not ſo wretched as to render them trouble and affliction for ſo many benefits as you have received of them; nor ſo ingrateful, as to fruſtrate the juſt hopes they have conceived of you. Certainly you would owe them this obedience, though no other conſideration did oblige you; than what is founded in themſelves. But
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50919:219"/>there is more than ſo. The Apoſtle aſſures you, that in performing your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto men, you will pleaſe GOD, the Father of Spirits, and Ruler of the World. This (ſaith he) is plaeſing unto Him. He will reckon it to you, as a part of the piety you owe Him, and charge Himſelf with the ſervices you ſhall render unto thoſe whom He hath given you for authors of your life. It's the beſt, and the moſt pleaſing devotion you can offer Him. Miſerable Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, that goeſt to ſeek in cloyſters for exerciſes pleaſing unto GOD! There was no need to go out of the Fathers houſe for this. Thou haſt enough at home wherewith to pleaſe the LORD. As for the particular exerciſes, about which Monks are buſied in their cloyſters, we know not whether they pleaſe GOD, who never commanded them. But for the ſervices which our Parents demand of us for their conſolation, and the eaſing of their lives, we cannot doubt but that they are moſt pleaſing to Him, ſince He commands them, and His Apoſtle aſſureth us here expreſly of it. Conſider, I pray, the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theſe people. They ſay they would pleaſe GOD, and that it's their whole aim to content Him. Mean time to attain thereto, they renounce the obeying of their Parents, which is pleaſing to him, and ſubject themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fanſies, and the rugged rules of certain men, of which they neither have, nor can have any aſſurance, that they pleaſe GOD; Is not this to quit a certainty for an uncertainty? and to do the wrong way, what one pretends; and go further off from what one ſeeks, and caſt one's ſelf upon what he would eſchew? But ye, Brethren, better inſtructed by the word of the LORD, ſeek to pleaſe Him, in doing what He orders you, and in employing that time and labour to the ſerving of, and obeying your Parents, which ſuperſtition lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in its painful, but vain, and fruitleſs exerciſes. This is the way to be pleaſing unto GOD, and to aſſure unto your ſelves that crown of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which He hath promiſed to ſuch children as faithfully diſcharge this duty.</p>
                     <p>As for you, Believing Parents, nature it ſelf, and the intereſt of your own happineſs ſo forcibly impelleth you to love your children, and to treat them well, that if the Apoſtle had forborn to give ſuch an expreſs advertiſement againſt provoking them, I think there would not have been much need to ſay any thing of it. We offend much more on the other hand; I mean, in exceſs of affection, and in the ſoftneſſes of indulgence; not heeding, that to treat them ſo laxely, is in truth, to hate, and not to love them; to deſtroy, and not to breed them up. The Apoſtle forbids you to provoke them; but hinders not your correcting, your reproving, your chaſtening them, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. He willeth only, that your conduct be juſt, and temperate; that it keep a mean between the two extremes, the roughneſs of ſeverity, and the remiſneſſe of indulgence. The care you owe them, is to form them unto true Vertue, unto the knowledge, and the fear of GOD, unto charity, and juſtice, and honeſty towards men; to give them examples hereof in your lives, and inculcate the leſſons of them with your lips. Whereas we our ſelves ruine their manners, and form them early to our Vices, almoſt before they know them. Our greateſt care is to keep their courage high, and inſtruct them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pride, and inure them unto vanity, as if nature had not given them enough of it. And hereto, they that have the means fail not to add Ball, and Dance, and Comedy. And that they may the better learn theſe brave leſſons, Fathers and Mothers give them examples of 'em. We need not wonder, if under ſuch education we ſee our youth to ſpeed ſo ill; if it become inſolent; if it hath little ſentiment of true piety; if it treat thoſe ſo much amiſs, to whom it oweth moſt reſpect. Brethren, if you have children, remember, that beſide the intereſt you have in their vertue, and their vices, you ſhall render an account for them unto GOD, who hath given them to you, to breed them for His glory, and for the edification of His Church; and not to content the world, or to ſerve vanity.</p>
                     <p>But, Dear Brethren, of whatever ſtate or condition we are, let us further take out two leſſons here, which the Apoſtle gives us. The one is, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50919:219"/>all of us unto GOD an exact, and humble obedience in all things, ſince we have the honour to be His children. It's this that the child owes his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We are not His, if we obey Him not. We falſly vaunt our ſelves in that glorious title, if we neglect the duty to which it obligeth us. The other leſſon is, that the Will of GOD ſhould be the only rule of our lives; ſo as we do nothing but what is pleaſing unto Him. This is the ſoveraign reaſon of our duties, not to dare any thing that diſpleaſeth Him, nor neglect any thing that's agreeable to Him. This rule is of very vaſt, and perpetual uſe in all the parts of life. And omitting others for this time, I beſeech you only to apply it to the paſtimes, to the balls, and banquettings, and comedies of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeaſon. Each of you conſult your own conſcience hereupon, if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the word of GOD; and ask it, if theſe exerciſes of the world be verily pleaſing unto GOD; and whether running after them with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, you can aſſure your ſelf you do therein a thing that delighteth him? If it anſwer, that there is no reaſon to believe it, but very much to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; in the name of GOD, my Brethren, follow this reſolution of your own conſcience. Abſtain from theſe works of darkneſs; Spare the Church; Give it no ſcandal; Expoſe not its name, and its profeſſion to the ſcorn of thoſe without, by engaging them in the diſorders of the preſent generation. Let your manners have no leſs purity in them, than your faith; and let there be a difference between the very divertiſements of children of GOD, and of others. Give to the poor what is caſt away uſually in ſuch follies, and you ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a firm and ſolid conſolation, which ſhall never be followed with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and regret, but go on ſtill increaſing, untill it be changed into that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and incomprehenſible joy which is kept for us in the Heavens by our LORD JESUS CHRIST, to whom, as to the Father, and the Holy Spirit, the true and only Eternal GOD, be Honour, Praiſe, and Glory, unto ages of ages, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F mankind, after the devaſtation ſin hath made, hath any thing left it, that is laudable, and commodious, and conducing unto wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, it is without doubt the order of thoſe ſocieties which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. For this correſpondence, and this harmony of ſeveral perſons, different in themſelves, and yet knit together by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual offices they do one another, and by that common end unto which they direct them, is an effect, and production of a very perſpicacious, and exquiſite reaſon, and bears ſuch evident marks of it, as no one can chooſe but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if he ever ſo little apply his mind to this conſideration. The thing is ſuch, as made an Heathen ſometime ſay,
<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> that that grand and ſupreme Divinity which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50919:220"/>governeth the world, doth ſee nothing on earth more agreeable to Him, than the bodies of Families, and Re-publicks eſtabliſh'd among men, and governed by good equitable laws. For as there is nothing, not only more unſightly and deformed, but alſo more incommodious, than confuſion; ſo on the contrary, there is nothing that is at once both more beautiful, and more beneficial, than order. For order, ſetting every thing in its place, and uniting all together, by the co-aptation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining of particulars; does cheriſh, and conſerve the whole; and by their union fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth up a body, which, conjoyning in one the forces and perfections of each of them, becomes by this means extremely fair, and moſt conſiderable. This is the reaſon why the Apoſtles of our LORD and Saviour did carefully diſcriminate this order from thoſe defects and imperfections which their Maſter came to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect in the world. And whereas their holy diſcipline doth batter, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and bring to nought all that the unrighteouſneſs, and the pride of ſin hath rear'd up among us: it doth eſtabliſh, and mightily confirm the civil, and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſocieties which it found in mankind; as ſo many holy and neceſſary inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of GOD our Creator.</p>
                     <p>You have heretofore heard with what affection St. <hi>Paul</hi> recommends to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the ſacred and inviolable duties of husbands and wives, of fathers and children, for conſerving domeſtick ſociety in its integrity among us. Now, that he might leave no diſorder at all in it, he ſpeaks to Servants and Maſters; and in this Text diſcreetly regulates the ſubjection of the former, and the domination of the latter; repreſenting to the one and the other of them, excellent conſiderations, taken from fundamentals of Goſpel-doctrine, to ſway them to their duty. The ſame, namely, the ſubjection of Servants, and the ſuperiority of Maſters ſhall be the two points we will treat of, if GOD permit, in this action; obſerving briefly the particulars they may afford for our common edification, and conſolation.</p>
                     <p>He inſiſteth moſt upon the firſt point, which reſpecteth ſervants; becauſe ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is bitter, and a thing which our nature is loth to accommodate its ſelf unto; eſpecially in the condition that ſervants at that time were. For it was not with them, as it is now with ours; who are perſons in reality free, and diſpoſing of themſelves, do only let out their ſervices for a time, and upon certain conditions; but not deveſt themſelves of the liberty they were born in. The ſervants of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, in the Apoſtle's time, and among the nations to whom he wrote; were ſlaves; which belonged to their Maſters, and were theirs by the ſame kind of property their cattle were. They could not diſpoſe of their own perſons, nor of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but by the authority and will of their maſters. The law of ſervitude was of like nature among the Jews alſo; excepting only, that ſuch ſervants as were of the Hebrew race, went out of that condition, and were ſet at liberty when they came to the year of Jubile; as is evident by divers places in the books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Apoſtle knowing how harſh this condition was unto men, took a particular care to ſweeten it, and to recommend the duties of it to ſuch as Divine Providence had ranked in it; leaſt diſguſt at ſo ſtrict a ſubjection, and love of liberty, ſhould carry them to ſhake off the yoke, and to diſturb the order of publick ſociety by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Firſt, he orders them to obey; next, he preſcribeth them the manner of this obedience; not ſerving to the eye, as willing to pleaſe men; and finally, in the two laſt verſes of this Chapter, he ſets before them ſome conſiderations taken from the benignity and juſtice of GOD, to incite them unto a faithful diſcharge of their duty. The command of obedience is expreſſed in theſe words; <hi>Servants, obey in all things them that are your Maſters according to the fleſh.</hi> The very names which he makes uſe of, do ſhew the juſtice of the duty which he gives them in charge. For ſince they are ſervants, and thoſe whom they ſerve, are their maſters; it's evident, that they are obliged by the reaſon and nature of the things themſelves, to render them exact and faithful obedience. But his ſaying of Maſters, that they are their maſters according to the fleſh, doth mitigate the rigour, and the meanneſs of ſervitude, limiting the power of maſters, and ſuperiors, and extending it no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than unto temporal, and corporeal things, not unto the ſoul, and conſcience. Man may be maſter of our fleſh, GOD alone is LORD over our Spirits. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the ſubjection of our bodies, we have ſtill our ſouls free, and dependant on
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50919:221"/>none but GOD their Creator; who alone hath the power, as well as the right, to do them good or evil; as our LORD and Saviour remonſtrates unto us. <hi>Fear not them</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>that kill the body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 10.28.</note> 
                        <hi>and cannot kill the ſoul: but rather fear Him who is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell.</hi> It is with this diſtinction, that we are to take the obedience which the Apoſtle recommends unto ſervants in all things: his meaning is, in all things that lye within the Maſter's power, and do purely and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer unto the fleſh, not reflecting on, or touching the intereſts of the ſpirit. For if our maſter according to the fleſh, command us things contrary to the will of our Maſter according to the ſpirit, (that is, of GOD;) in this caſe it is evident, that we ought to obey GOD rather than man; and that if we owe much, and in ſome ſenſe even all things unto men, yet we owe them nothing to the prejudice of GOD; and that there is nothing but we ſhould ſuffer, rather than fail of that firſt and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſervitude we owe to our Creator and Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>This holy doctrine of the Apoſtle's, ſheweth us, firſt, that the LORD JESUS CHRIST doth not at all diſturb the order of humane ſocieties. He leaves to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in them, the juſt rights they are poſſeſſed of, unto perſons or things. He ſubjecteth us unto Himſelf, and unto GOD His Father; but without doing wrong unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or any of the lawful powers that govern either Eſtates or Families. He intends, that all His ſhould render to them what they owe them; He deſtroys but the treacheries and tyrannie of ſin and Satan. <hi>Herod,</hi> dread not His coming; He will neither pull your Scepter out of your hand, nor diminiſh in any thing the rights of your Crown. His deſign is to give you Heaven, not to out you of the earth; to enfranchiſe you from the ſlavery of vices, and not to deprive you of the ſervice of your ſubjects. Whence appears, how unjuſt and ſcandalous the pretention of thoſe is, who under the ombrage of Goſpel-liberty, would aboliſh all dominion and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty among Chriſtians; accounting it incompatible with the ſtate of grace: and theirs no leſs, who ſubject, even in reſpect of temporals, all that are Chriſtians, not the greateſt Monarchs excepted, to one mortal man; making their Crowns to depend upon his will, and giving him authority to depoſe them, and to looſe their ſubjects from the yoke of their obedience; dogmatizing too by the ſame means, that a Chriſtian Prince, who falleth into hereſie, loſeth the right he had over his people. Can there a thing be ſaid, more pernicious, or more contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, who would not, that Paganiſm it ſelf, a matter worſe than hereſie, ſhould make Maſters and Superiors loſe any of the lawful rights they have over their Chriſtian ſlaves? Secondly, the Apoſtle's limiting the authority and power of maſters over their ſlaves, in things of the fleſh, naming them, their maſters according to the fleſh, doth ſhew us, that there is none but GOD alone, who is our Maſter according to the ſpirit: whence it follows, that ſuch, as under any pretext whatever, do peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily invade the Lordly ruling of our ſouls, do grievouſly erre, and uſurp a thing which belongs to none but GOD; an attentat, which thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> are evidently guilty of, in that they put the conſciences of all Chriſtians in ſubjection to their Pope, and Council; whereas the holy Apoſtles do expreſly declare, that they have no dominion over our faith;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.19. 1 Pet. 5.2.</note> and advertiſe all the Miniſters of CHRIST, to feed the flock committed to them, not as being Lords over GOD's heritage, but ſo, as they may be a pattern to them.</p>
                     <p>But I return unto St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who having in general injoyned ſervants that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which they owe their maſters according to the fleſh in all things, doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the manner after which he would have 'em to obey them; not ſerving to the eye (ſaith he) as bent to pleaſe men; but in ſimplicity of heart, fearing GOD. He firſt purgeth the carriage of Chriſtian ſervants, of a vice very ordinary with perſons of that quality; namely, ſerving only to the eye; becauſe they have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign, but to content men. They do not think themſelves obliged by reaſons of conſcience, but only by thoſe of their own intereſt, to do their maſters any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſervice; And ſo they ſerve them no further, than they judge neceſſary for the exempting themſelves from that chaſtiſement which they ſhould incurr, if they fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obey; or for their procuring ſome recompence, by winning their favour. They reſpect nothing but this in all the obedience they render them. Whence it comes, that when they ſee their maſter preſent, they play the good husbands, as we
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50919:221"/>ſay, and labour at their work with moſt officious diligence and care. But if he turn his back, they return unto their nature, caring for nothing leſs, than for his ſervice; like that evil ſervant in the parable, who ſeeing that his maſter delaid to come, betook himſelf to his debauches, and fell an outraging his Lord's houſhold, and waſting his goods. All theſe peoples ſervitude is but a Comedy. And as Players put on their diſguiſe, and act their parts when there is an aſſembly of ſpectators; ſo theſe do not their duty but when their maſter looketh on. And if they thought they could deceive his eyes, and knowledge, or avoid his correcting them, or ſave their ſalary, they would ſurely never take the pain to do ought of what he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. It's this fallacious, and truly ſervile diſpoſition of heart, which the Apoſtle here forbids to Chriſtian ſervants, when he ſays, they ſhould not ſerve to the eye, as aiming only to pleaſe men.</p>
                     <p>But inſtead of this, he would have them ſerve in ſingleneſs of heart, fearing GOD; that is, ſincerely, without fraud, or feigning, and having more reſpect to GOD than men. To that eye-ſervice he had mentioned, he oppoſeth ſingleneſs of heart; and to the pleaſing of men, the fearing of GOD. The Scripture is wont to attribute two hearts, or a double heart unto a feigning perſon; becauſe he maketh ſhew of one intention, and yet hath another quite different: ſo he that ſerves to the eye. To ſee him, you would ſay, that he loves his maſter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires his profit; yet under this deceitful maſque, he hides quite different thoughts and affections; heeding nothing leſs than the intereſts of him whom he ſerves. But the ſervant whom the Apoſtle formeth here, hath but one affection, and one thought; and having learned in the School of CHRIST, that it is juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable the ſervant ſhould obey his maſter, he ſerves his, to fulfill this piece of righteouſneſs, and acquit himſelf of his duty, which he would think himſelf defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in, if he did otherwiſe; ſo that bearing about every where this ſentiment with him engraven in his conſcience, there is neither place nor time wherein he doth not faithfully ſerve his maſter; whether he be abſent or preſent, ſeen or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Hereto the Apoſtle further addeth, that he do fear GOD. Whereas others to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally referr the condition of ſervants only unto man; he would have a Chriſtian know, that GOD is the author of it; that it's He who hath appointed it; and would have us approve our fidelity in it, when His providence hath called us to it. Think not, (ſaith he) that you have to do with none but men. It's GOD who hath put you in this eſtate. Do not imagine it ſufficient, to reſpect, and content the eye of your maſter. You muſt reverence, and ſatisfie the eye of GOD, whom you cannot deceive, nor content at any lower rate, than the doing of your duty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, and ſincerely. But the Apoſtle would not have a Chriſtian ſimply to do all his Maſter commands him. He would alſo have him do it chearfully, and with the heart; <hi>Whatever ye do,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do it all with courage;</hi> that is, firſt, not by conſtraint, and with murmurring; but voluntarily; and ſecondly, with affection for thoſe who command you.</p>
                     <p>Verily, you will ſay, an hard law. For if the Maſter be froward; if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as often happens, things that are difficult, and harſh, and inhumane; how is it poſſible a ſervant ſhould fall to work about them, with any cheerfulneſs? I anſwer, that our fleſh finds it uneaſie to reliſh ſuch obedience; and cannot ſuffer ſo hard a bit without reluctance, and recalcitration. But the fear of GOD inclines us to account thoſe things ſweet, which are of their own nature very harſh. If you look upon man only, I acknowledge you have ſome ground to think it hard, that one, who is at the bottom but a man as you are, ſhould have you in ſuch ſubjection to his will. But if you lift up your eyes higher, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it is GOD who hath inſtituted this order; that it's He who hath called you to this condition; that the maſter whom you ſerve, is His Miniſter, and Officer; then the rougheſt of his commands will become ſupportable to you. And it's to this the Apoſtle reduceth you, when to bend you unto this ſweet and willing obedience, he adviſeth you, to do all things as unto the LORD, and not as unto men. <hi>Make account</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that it is to JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:50919:222"/>and not to a mortal man, that you render your ſervices. Reſpect this ſoveraign LORD in the perſon of your maſters; and think that it's He who orders you to do all that they command you. For He likewiſe it is, who hath given you them, by His providence, for Maſters. Withal, He declares expreſly in His word, that it is His will you ſhould obey them. Admire now, Chriſtian, I pray, the vertue of the Goſpel; which, as ſometime the tree of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth ſweeten the bittereſt things, and ſo changeth their nature, that of diſtaſteful, and forced, it makes them pleaſing, and voluntary. What is there harder, or more abject, than the ſervitude of a ſlave? The Goſpel changeth it into a devotion, into a religious ſervice; that is, into the nobleſt, and moſt voluntary of all humane actions. The beleever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth that obedience unto JESUS CHRIST, which an infidel gives only to his maſter. He doth that for his GOD, which the other doth but for a man. Wherefore he doth it chearfully, and heartily, while the other doth it not, but by conſtraint, and with regret. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith elſe-where, that <hi>a ſervant, called in the LORD,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.22.</note> 
                        <hi>is the LORD's free-man.</hi> Not, that he ceaſeth to do his former maſter the ſervice he was wont; This he is ſo far from, that he now becomes much more faithful,
<note place="margin">Philem. 10.</note> and much more profitable to him than he 'erſt was: as <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus</hi> the ſervant of <hi>Philemon,</hi> who after he once knew JESUS CHRIST, went voluntarily to put himſelf again under his old Maſter's yoke, which during the darkneſs of his unbelief he had caſt off. All the difference is, that whereas in the time of his ignorance, he had reſpect meerly to his maſter's will, and authority; now he hath little regard thereto, conſidering principally his LORD and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's; ſo that, to ſay the truth, 'tis Him he ſerves, and not a man. CHRIST hath freed him from man's yoke, and put him under his own; ſince henceforth his aim in all he doth for man, is chiefly to pleaſe, not man, but JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>For the forming of the ſpirits of Chriſtian ſervants to this holy diſpoſition, the Apoſtle repreſents unto them, in the two laſt verſes of this Chapter, that the LORD JESUS is indeed the true Maſter, and ſuper-intendent of their whole lives, who ſets them their task, and looks on their labours whatever condition they are in, and will not fail when His day is come, to make up a true and faithful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt with them; largely recompencing ſuch of them, as ſhall be found to have honeſtly diſcharged their duty, and ſeverely puniſhing the negligent. <hi>Do all things, as to the LORD, and not as unto men; knowing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you ſhall receive of the LORD the reward of the inheritance, for ye ſerve the LORD CHRIST. But he that doth unjuſtly, ſhall receive what he hath unjuſtly done, and there is no reſpect of perſons.</hi> Firſt, he would have them take for certain, that their ſervitude ſhall not be in vain, nor unfruitful, if they acquit themſelves in it, as he hath preſcribed; and if their maſters according to the fleſh have no regard to it, their ſoveraign LORD will not fail to give them their pay, and recompence. Next, he ſhews them what this recompence is, which they are to expect from the LORD. <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the reward of the inheritance.</hi> Thers's no one in the School of CHRIST, but well knows, that this inheritance which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, is that bleſſed and glorious immortality which JESUS CHRIST hath purchas'd for us by the merit of His death, and calls us all to the poſſeſſion of, by His Goſpel. Now ſee how prudently the holy Apoſtle hath ballanced his expreſſions of it! He calleth it a reward, or guerdon, that is, a retribution, and a prize; to the end he might raiſe our hearts unto this ſublime hope, and incite us thereby to labour chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for the receiving of ſo rich a recompence. For as prizes are not given, but to thoſe that have laboured, and ſtriven; ſo this life of GOD is not prepared, but for thoſe that ſhall, in their vocation, have fought a good fight, and kept the faith, and duly finiſhed their courſe. And, as the Prince promiſeth a Souldier, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and the Maſter a work-man, wages; and the one do perform, if the others diſcharge their duty: ſo the LORD promiſeth us His kingdom, and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His faithfulneſſe, aſſuredly give it to every one that doth believe, and perſevere. Lo! wherefore the holy Apoſtle calls that bleſſed life, we hope for, a reward, or guerdon.</p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:50919:222"/>
                     <p>But leſt this term ſhould cauſe us to preſume of ſome merit in our labours; he pertinently adds another name, to cure us of that error; and calls the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, an inheritance. For an inheritance, (as all know) comes not by merit; but by another different title, even becauſe one is a child of the Family. Expect then, Faithful ſouls, this Divine retribution, not from the dignity or merit of your works, but from the bounty and munificence of GOD; who having freely adopted you into the number of His children, will give you part in this eternal inheritance: to which neither you, nor any mortal man, had naturally any right at all. It is His grace, and His faithfulneſs, and His promiſe, that conferrs upon you all the ſhare you have in it. And His goodneſs, and word being immutable, you ought to expect it with as much aſſurance as if you merited it; though you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that you never can. But becauſe it might ſeem ſtrange, that the Apoſtle ſhould promiſe Chriſtians the reward of the inheritance of the LORD, for ſervices done to men; he repeats what he had intimated afore, namely, that to ſpeak properly, it's JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST they ſerve, and not men; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you ſerve the LORD CHRIST.</hi> It is true, this Soveraign LORD is in Heaven, in perfect glory, and hath no need of our ſervices much leſs of ſuch as ſlaves and mercenaries do their Maſters. But ſuch is His goodneſs, that He allows us, all that as done to His own perſon, which we do to men according to His command, and for His ſake. Thus He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth us in the Goſpel, that it is to Him we give all the alms, the viſits, and aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, wherewith we gratifie the leaſt of His ſervants in His Name.
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.40.</note> 
                        <hi>You have done it unto Me,</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>in that you have done it to one of the leaſt of theſe.</hi> All the duties of that obedience which He commands us, are of the ſame nature in this behalf. Doing them unto men, we do them unto JESUS CHRIST, who hath commanded them; therefore it's alſo unto Him, that the leaſt and loweſt ſervices do pertain, which men perform to the Maſters, unto whom the order of His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath put them in ſubjection, which they perform, I ſay, becauſe of Him, or for His ſake: ſo that He being infinitely good, and liberal, they ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend aſſuredly, that precious recompence which He promiſeth thoſe that ſerve Him.</p>
                     <p>But if ſo high and glorious an hope be not ſufficient to affect us, and ſway us to that willing obedience which He requireth of us, let us regard at leaſt the penalty He denounceth, in caſe we fail of our duty. It's this the Apoſtle ſets here before the eyes of Chriſtian ſervants, when after propoſal of the reward of the heavenly inheritance to ſuch as diſcharge their duty, he addeth; But he that doth unjuſtly, ſhall receive what he hath unjuſtly done, and there is no regard to the ſhew of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. It's a general ſentence, reaching all men of whatever condition they be, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or maſters, men or women, poor or rich. Whoever doth another wrong, either by poſitive outrage, or by not rendring what he owes him according to the laws of the Goſpel, ſhall receive at the hand of the ſupreme Judge, what he hath unjuſtly done; that is, be payed for his fault, and puniſhed with a penalty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly proportioned to their crime. Nor ſhould any one perſwade himſelf, either that the miſerableneſs of his condition will move the Judge to pity him, or that the ſplendor and grandeur of his quality will blind His eyes, and ſo conceit the poſſibility of an eſcape. In this Divine judgement, no regard (ſaith the Apoſtle) is had to the look, or outſide of men. GOD will weigh your cauſe alone; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your perſon. And as He will not take notice of the rich, or the mighty; not of Lords, or Monarchs, ſo as to ſpare them, if they have lived in the practice of unrighteouſneſs, and violence; ſo neither will He regard the poverty, or meanneſs of the loweſt, as to exempt them from the puniſhments which their unjuſtneſs or infidelity deſerveth; but, as He ſometime commanded the Judges of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lev. 19.15.</note> He will judge juſtly, not honouring the countenance of the potent, nor reſpecting the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the poor. Whence it follows, that ſervants which rob their maſters, or ſerve them not as they ought, ſhall ſurely ſuffer for their injuſtice; ſince granting, that men do let their wickedneſs paſs unchaſtiſed, yet the ſupreme Judge of the World will not fail to call them to their tryal one day; and bring to publick light, the infidelities, the theeveries, and acts of diſobedience, which they think they have hid ſafe enough in the dark of their deceits; and condemn them to the juſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50919:223"/>torments they have merited, by violating the ſacred orders He hath made for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety, and doing that to others, which they would not any ſhould do to them. Such is, Brethren, the Apoſtle's inſtruction to ſervants.</p>
                     <p>Let us now peruſe what he preſcribes to Maſters. <hi>Maſters,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>render to your ſervants right, and equity, knowing that you alſo have a Maſter in Heaven.</hi> Firſt, he gives them in charge their duty; Secondly, ſets before them an excellent reaſon to ſway them to it. Their duty is, to render right and equity to their ſervants. It may not be imagined, that the power of Maſters over their ſervants is unlimited.</p>
                     <p>A mutual juſtice there is between them, which obligeth them each to other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally; and either of them, that treſpaſſeth againſt the rules thereof, is faulty. And as it is juſt, that ſervants ſhould obey, and be ſubject; ſo is it likewiſe juſt, that Maſters ſhould be of good conduct, and give meet entertainment. It's this the Apoſtle means by that right, which he chargeth them to render to their ſervants. It compriſeth work, maintenance, correction, and wages. So that Maſters are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, for the right diſcharging of this duty towards them, to carry themſelves in theſe four points, with all prudence, and equity, giving them a reaſonable task to do, ſufficient food, moderate chaſtiſement, and a meet ſalary. They that do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and tranſgreſs in theſe things, either by defect, or exceſs, do not render to their ſervants what is right; as for inſtance, thoſe that overbear them with toil or ſtrokes; and they that quite contrary, let them live idle, and in debauches; thoſe that diet them ill, or too well; and laſtly, they that defraud them of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which is one of the moſt horrid, and cruel acts of injuſtice, that can be committed.</p>
                     <p>But beſides right, the Apoſtle would have Maſters render alſo to their ſervants, equity. The word he makes uſe of in the original, properly ſignifies, a certain equality, and correſpondence, that ſhould appear between the offices of the one of them, and the deportment of the other; ſo that, as the ſervant obeyeth in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, and in the fear of GOD, the Maſter likewiſe do command holily, and religiouſly; and that, as the one ſerveth with joy, and reſpect, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the other do govern with mildneſs, and affection. In a word, right compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all that refers to juſtice; and equity, all that pertains to Chriſtian Charity, and gentleneſs.</p>
                     <p>For the reducing of the faithful unto this holy moderation, he orders them to remember, that they alſo have a LORD in the Heavens. His meaning is, that the dominion they have over their ſervants, is not abſolute, but dependant on GOD, and by conſequence, ſuch as ought to be regulated by His word, and will. If they have people beneath them; they have a Maſter, and a Soveraign above them, who is the common LORD of them all, and unto whom they are to give account of the treatment which their ſervants ſhall receive at their hands. He ſays particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that this LORD is in the Heavens; to hold them the better to their duty by the conſideration of ſo redoutable a Majeſty; who is, not here beneath, on earth, the place of miſery, and vanity; but on high in Heaven, ſitting on an eternal throne; and from that glorious habitation of light, and immortality, doth conſider, and govern all things at His pleaſure, nothing coming to paſs in His whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but He plainly perceives, and moſt juſtly judgeth of. This great LORD is above all; and there is neither Maſter, nor Prince of ſuch elevation among men, but is under His feet. He is ſuperlatively holy, juſt, and good. He loveth all His creatures, and concerns Himſelf in the wrongs of the meaneſt, and moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones; hating nothing more than injuſtice, and inſolence, outrage, and cruelty; poſſeſſing withal, an infinite wiſdome, and an almighty power, which none is able to reſiſt. Sure then, conſideration of the Empire, and ſoveraign dominion that He hath over us, is very proper to keep us within bounds, and to reſtrain us from abuſing the power He hath given us over perſons ſubject to us; nor could the Apoſtle put thoſe that have ſervants, in mind of any thing more pertinently, that ſhould oblige 'em, to render them right, and equity. Thus we have explained his inſtructions. It's now for you, Beloved Brethren, to make your profit of them, and to gather the fruits he offers you in them, for the amendment of your lives, and the conſolation of your ſouls.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Ye Chriſtians, whom the meanneſs of your birth, or (as they call it) of your fortune, hath reduc'd to the condition of ſerving, rejoyce ye at the the honour done you by this great Miniſter of CHRIST, who diſdaineth not to addreſs his holy voice unto you. Set the care he hath of you, againſt the contempt that men caſt upon you. Let his ſpeaking to you comfort you, and raiſe your hopes of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of GOD. Think well upon the report he makes you, that the perſons to whom ye are ſubject, are not your Maſters, but in reference to the fleſh. Your ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will not be eternal. Nay, it will not be very long, nor extend further at moſt, then to the end of that carnal life, which ye lead upon the earth. When this earthly tabernacle is once diſſolved, you ſhall enter into the glorious liberty of the children of GOD; and then there will no more be any difference between you and your Maſters. For the preſent, your better part is already in poſſeſſion of this liberty; namely, that ſpirit, which GOD hath formed in you after his own image, and which, maugre all the outrages of men, will ever remain maſter of it ſelf, if you give it to JESUS CHRIST, the great freer of mankind, who doth faithfully, and ſpeedily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſe every one, that receiveth and embraceth His truth. Only take heed, that ye abuſe not His grace; as if the ſpiritual liberty, He hath gratify'd you with, did diſcharge you from doing faithful ſervice to your Maſters after the fleſh. The more He hath illuminated you in the knowledge of Himſelf, the more fidelity and love do you owe. For beſides other reaſons, the fear of GOD, and the will of JESUS CHRIST, doth now oblige you to obey them; ſo that the ſerving them makes up a part of your piety. According to your acquitting your ſelves therein, well or ill, GOD will give you, or deny you his inheritance. But beſides your own intereſt, the glory alſo of the Goſpel is concerned in the caſe. For your faults defame our religion, and make it believ'd to be a licentious diſcipline, whereas your fidelity will produce us praiſe. Every one will be conſtrained to acknowledge the ſanctity of our doctrine, when they ſhall ſee it reform the deportment even of man and maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants. And this, the Apoſtle doth expreſly repreſent unto you elſewere.

                        <hi>Let ſervants</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be obedient to their maſters, pleaſing them well in all things, not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering again, not purloyning, but ſhewing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of GOD our Saviour in all things.</hi> Object me not the ill humour and rigour of your Maſters.

                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.18.</note> who obligeth you to ſerve not only ſuch as are good and equitable, but alſo the froward. Take their ill treatment for an occaſion, by which GOD would exerciſe and refine your faith.

Let the eye of JESUS CHRIST, who looketh on you; let His favour and benediction, which always accompany conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſufferings; let the hope of his inheritance for your Salary, ſweeten all the pains of your ſervitude. How ingrateful ſoever men be to you, your patience ſhall not be left unrewarded, if ye perſevere in it conſtantly for CHRIST'S ſake.</p>
                     <p>And you Maſters, who ſo much deſire to have faithful, and obedient ſervants, render ye to them that right and equity, which the Apoſtle commands you. Though your extraction or eſtates ſet you above them in humane ſociety; yet your nature is no other then theirs. Ye are ſubject to the like infirmities with them. One and the ſame death will conſume you both; nor will there be any difference between your duſt and theirs. You ſhall appear before the ſame Judge, and the tribunal at which you ſhall be examined, will have no more complacency for you, then for them. That LORD whom you ſee over you is their Creatour and Redeemer, as well as yours. He hath put them under you: but to govern them, not to tyrannize over them; to have care of them, as his creatures and children, not to tread them under foot as worms. Remember, He will treat you, as ye ſhall have treated them. You are his ſervants, as they are yours; or to ſay better, they are your brethren, and ye are not worthy to be ſo much as His Vaſſals. You and they are one and the ſame fleſh, that came out of the earth, and unto earth ſhall return: but neither they, nor you, have any thing in common with GOD. He is in the Heavens, and you crawl in the dirt. He is the King of Glory, and ye are but duſt and aſhes. Yet, ſuch is His goodneſs, that notwithſtanding this infinite inequality, He hath not diſdained
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50919:224"/>your nothingneſs. He hath pardoned you your ſins; He hath waſhed you in the bloud of his Son; He hath forgiven you all your debts; He hath communicated to you His divine nature. Reſpect His graces; and have no leſs gentleneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for your own fleſh and bloud, then this Soveraign LORD hath had for you, who were His enemies. With what face will you beg mercy of Him, if ye be inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to your people? How can you hope for the grace of your Maſter, if you have none for your Servants? I beſeech you both, have theſe holy thoughts night and day fore your eyes; to the end, you may faithfully diſcharge thoſe mutual duties, which the Apoſtle enjoyns you; the one, ſubjection, and obedience; the others, juſtice, and equity; both of you living in ſuch an holy correſpondence, as that the loyalty, the reſpect, the humility, the ſubmiſſion, and the diligence of ſervants may go in conjunction with the gentleneſs, the gravity, the liberality, and benevolence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. If ye ſo do, you will be happy; the families where you live together in this manner, will become the wonder of the earth, and the honour of the Church. The bleſſing of Heaven will fall continually on them, and beſides the contentment, and repoſe, which this kind of life will give you abundantly for the preſent, it will alſo bring you hereafter into the poſſeſſion of the heavenly inheritance.</p>
                     <p>But, Dear Brethren, it is not enough, that thoſe Maſters and Servants, to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> particularly ſpeaks, do make their profit of his inſtructions. We all have in them what to learn of whatever quality and condition we be. For ſince he would have ſervants render ſo exact, and ſo frank an obedience to their Maſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, judge ye, what kind of obedience we owe to that Higheſt LORD, whom we all have in Heaven. The Maſter according to the fleſh, gave not his ſervant the being he hath; and if he redeemed him, he redeemed but his fleſh, and that at the price of a ſum of money only. Ours did make us, and it's by His libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality alone, that we hold all the being, life and motion that we have. Nor hath He only created us; He hath alſo redeemed the whole of us, our ſoul and body, fleſh and ſpirit; not with ſilver and gold, which are corruptible things, but with His own precious bloud, having voluntarily ſacrific'd His life to preſerve us from death, and give us an happy immortality. Never Maſter had ſo much right to command His ſervants, as He hath in reference to us. Let us obey Him then in all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſervation; and conſecrate this whole life of ours to His ſervice, the whole whereof we have once and again received from His grace. Neither is it with this LORD, as with Maſters according to the fleſh; Theſe oftentimes command things unjuſt, or unhoneſt, things contrary to our ſalvation, which we cannot do without deſtroying our ſelves. He commands us nothing, but what is juſt, what is honeſt and reaſonable, what is worthy both of Himſelf and of us. Wherefore the moſt abject bond-ſervant owes his Maſter but a limited obedience? whereas we owe ours ſuch as is abſolute and infinite. His yoke is eaſie, and His burthen light. He demands no other thing of us, but that we love Him, and our brethren for His ſake; that we live honeſtly and holily, that is, be happy. O ingrateful and execrable creatures that we are, if we deny a Maſter, to whom we owe ſo much, ſo juſt, and ſo reaſonable, ſo beneficial, and ſo bleſſed an obedience!</p>
                     <p>Again judge, ye Faithful, if the bond-ſervant ought to obey his Maſter in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, with courage and affection, (as the Apoſtle ſays,) with what ardour, promtitude, and devotion ſhould we ſerve ours, who is not only allmighty, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but alſo goodneſs, love, clemency, and beneficence it ſelf? Then, as for the bond-man, though he ought to ſerve his Maſter at all times, and in every place; yet his Maſter ſees him not always; whereas we are ever under the eye of ours. He hath a full view of us, ſees us within and without: nor can we hide our ſelves in any place, where He is not preſent. We cannot ſpeak a word, nor form the leaſt thought in the ſecret of our hearts, but He's a witneſs of it, knows the whole aſſoon as our ſelves. Now ſure there is no ſlave ſo ſottiſh and ſhameleſs, but the Maſter's eye will keep in order, and compel unto obedience. It ſuch a one be idle, or exorbitant, he is not ſo but in the other's abſence. Since then we have ours alway preſent, what remaineth but that we be never idle? that we employ all our time in His ſervice? bearing reſpect to His Divine eye, that looketh on us, and is over us, both day and night.</p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:50919:224"/>
                     <p>Again, even when the ſerving of a man is in queſtion, the Apoſtle would have the ſlave, not ſerve to pleaſe the man meerly; ſo great an integrity and probity doth he require in all our performances. Judge then how much more holy, and how much more pure from all intereſt, that obedience ſhould be, which we render to the LORD JESUS, GOD bleſſed for ever? Undoubtedly, they that ſerve Him to pleaſe men, to gain their eſteem, and acquire a reputation for ſanctity among them, or to draw thence any other profit; they, I ſay, beſide their being ridiculous and vain, do commit alſo an huge and an inexcuſable ſacriledge; profaning the Name of GOD, and the ſacred acts of religion,
<note place="margin">Matt. 6.2.</note> and moſt unrighteouſly abuſing them for worldly ends. Such are thoſe hypocrites, that faſt, and pray, and hear the word of GOD, and celebrate His Sacraments, and give alms, to be ſeen, and had in honour; that, in ſhort, ſerve not GOD, but to pleaſe men. They, ſaith CHRIST, have their wages. They are paid, they have nothing more to look for at GOD's hands. For ſuch vain and deceitful ſervice, they ſhall have no other reward; but that vain and deceitful breath, which they have coveted, and ſottiſhly preferred to the glory of GOD.</p>
                     <p>Let us eſchew at once theſe peoples miſcarriage, and their miſery; and according to the Apoſtle's prudent, and divine injunction, whatever we do, whether the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be addreſſed unto GOD, or reſpect our neighbour, do it all, as unto GOD, and not as unto man. Let us ſeek for, neither other ſpectator, nor other remunerator, than Him alone. Be we content with his approbation, and with the teſtimony of our own conſciences, whatever cenſure men do paſs upon us; being aſſured, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> here adds, that if we ſerve the LORD, if it be Him, we obey; if it be to His will, and glory, that we conſecrate, and direct the courſe of our lives, we ſhall infallibly receive from His bountiful hand, the reward of the inheritance; and on the contrary, that they that do unjuſtly, and deſpiſing His truth, are injurious either to His Majeſty, or His creatures, ſhall receive what they have unjuſtly done, without reſpect of perſons. Looking for ſo great and dreadful a judgement, at which the leaſt of our actions, whether they be good, or evil, ſhall be examined in preſence of the aſſembly of the whole univerſe, <hi>what manner of perſons,</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; Prayer is the Chriſtian's ſacrifice, the holieſt exerciſe of his devotion; his conſolation in troubles, his ſtay in weakneſſes; the principal weapon he uſeth in combats; his oracle in doubts, and perplexities; his ſafety in perils; the ſweetning of his bitterneſſes; the balm of his wounds; his help in adverſity; the ſupport, and ornament of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; and in a word, the key of the treaſury of GOD, which opens it to him, and puts in his hand all the good things that are neceſſary for the one and the other life, this of the earth, and that of heaven. Hence it is, that the holy Apoſtles give it us in charge, with ſo much affection, and diligence, in all thoſe divine inſtructions of theirs, which are come to our hands. Not to ſeek further off for inſtances of it, you ſee how St. <hi>Paul,</hi> being upon the point to conclude this excellent Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> after he had informed their faith, and regulated their manners, and explained their duty, both in general towards all men, and towards certain ſorts of men in particular, within the ſocieties in which they live; ſets an exhortation to prayer at the head of ſome other documents, which he addeth before he makes an end. <hi>Perſevere in prayer,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>watching therein with thanksgiving.</hi> And in truth, it's with a great deal of reaſon, that he reminds us of ſo important, and ſo neceſſary a duty. For ſince GOD is the Father of lights, from whom cometh down every good and perfect gift, how can we, without His favour and benediction, either acquire, or conſerve the faculties and habits of this divine life, unto which the holy Apoſtle would form us, together with the vertues that relate to it? Since then prayer hath the promiſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50919:225"/>of obtaining from His liberality, whatſoever it ſhall ask of him in faith, it's upon good ground, that the Apoſtle wills the <hi>Coloſſians to</hi> addreſs themſelves continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to GOD by prayer, for the meet and faithful diſcharging of thoſe duties he preſcribed them. After this, he further adds two advertiſements more; the one, of converſing wiſely with thoſe that are without; and the other, to ſeaſon their ſpeech, the principal inſtrument of converſation, with the ſalt of grace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he concludes this Epiſtle with the praiſes of <hi>Tychicus,</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> who were the bearers of it; and with ſalutations he makes them on the behalf of ſome then with him; adjoyning his own to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> themſelves, and likewiſe to the faithful of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> This is the ſumm of this laſt Chapter of his letter; as you ſhall here more particularly (by the will of GOD) in the following actions. At preſent we purpoſe, His grace aſſiſting, to entertain you with what he ſaith of prayer, in thoſe three Verſes we have read: and to do it in order, we will treat one after another, of the two points that offer themſelves in the ſame: firſt, of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in general. <hi>Perſevere in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving.</hi> Secondly, of their praying particularly, and expreſly for him, which he requireth of them. <hi>Praying together alſo for us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Man being in ſome ſort ſecretly conſcious of his own weakneſs, and knowing how little ſuccour ſecond cauſes can afford him, for the conſervation, and the happineſs of his life, is in a manner naturally inclin'd to call unto his aid by prayer, that veiled, and inviſible Deity, whoſe Providence he ſcenteth in every thing, though he perceiveth not its form. All religions in the world do give clear and very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs teſtimony to this truth, there never having been any known, but that had its prayers and letanies addreſſed to GOD: and greateſt idolaters, and the deplorableſt wicked men are wont to cry out when a danger ſurpriſeth them, O LORD, help me. O GOD deliver me; lifting up their eyes at that time to Heaven, as if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that caſe did its ſelf compell them to do homage to that Majeſty, which they outrage or blaſpheme through the reſt of their lives. But what Nature doth too too imperfectly teach us, we learn plainly, and fully from the Scripture; where we have both expreſs commands to call on GOD, and promiſes of favourable audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and examples of all holy men under the one and the other Covenant; whoſe oriſons the Holy Spirit hath taken care to keep up for us in theſe ſacred regiſters of the Church. St. <hi>Paul</hi> preſuppoſing therefore here, that the Faithful he wrote to, had this exerciſe of prayer familiar among them, according to that common principle of nature, and of Scripture, does only regulate them in the manner of performing it, adviſing them to perſevere in it, to watch in it, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it with thanksgiving.</p>
                     <p>As for perſeverance in prayer, 'tis not without reaſon, that he expreſly gives it us in charge. For though the duty be not only very juſt, but even moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; yet we are of our ſelves ſo cold, and ſluggiſh, and ſo indiſpoſed to the performance of it, that we all need the heavenly voice of this Miniſter of GOD, to excite us unto it. Preſuming that we have the things we need, in our own power, or ſhall find them in the ſufficiency of nature; and not conſidering how they all depend upon the hands of GOD, we remit the aſſiduous invocating of him, and make not uſe of prayer, but on extraordinary occaſions, when humane ſuccour faileth us; as the manner is in tragedies, where the Deity is not brought in, but at ſome difficulties, which no created power or prudence is able to clear. On the other hand, we are ſo proudly delicate and tender, that if we are not heard as ſoon as we have ſpoken, we flye off, and are ready to ſay, as that King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> once did: <hi>Why ſhould I wait on the LORD any longer?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Kings 6.33.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the curing our ſelves of ſo pernicious an humour, and that we may perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in prayer, according to the Apoſtle's advice, let us conſider in the firſt place, the continual need we have of GOD's aſſiſtance: For ſince it is in Him that we have being, life, and motion; ſince it is He who ſendeth poverty, and maketh rich; who ſets up, and puts down; who diſpenceth health and ſickneſs; who bringeth to the grave, and reduceth thence; who governs the hearts of men, and the elements of nature. Since it is He again, who beginneth, who poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and perfecteth all the work of grace, and crowneth it with glory; who
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50919:226"/>effectually produceth in us both the will and the deed of his good pleaſure; it is evident, that without the help of His holy, and moſt happy hand, we can never come to poſſeſs any good either in our own perſons, or in our families; either in the State, or in the Church; nor be preſerved, and ſecured, or freed, and ſaved from any evil of any kind whatever. You cannot refuſe belief of this great truth, without imputing falſhood at once to the Scriptures of GOD, and the depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Nature, both which do harmoniouſly report, and averr it to us on all hands. Yet if thou credit it, why do you not conſider what it neceſſarily inferrs, namely, that having continual need of GOD's aſſiſtance, you are by your own intereſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to implore it continually? And that as you cannot paſs a day without His favourable ſuccour, ſo neither ſhould you ſpend a day without calling on His Name? Look, I beſeech you, upon poor beggars, with what earneſtneſs, with what indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable perſeverance they ſpend whole daies, nay, their whole life a petitioning of us. It's a ſenſe of their neceſſity, that gives them this conſtancy, and inſpires this courage into them. Dear Brethren, we have infinitely more need of the ſuccours of GOD, than theſe poor people have of ours. Why are not we at leaſt as earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, as conſtant, and aſſiduous in beſeeching Him, as they are in asking alms of us? As for them; our flintineſs is ſuch, that for the moſt part they reap little or no fruit of their perſeverance in praying of us: whereas the LORD according to the riches of His infinite goodneſs, and power, never ſends away aſhamed ſuch as perſevere in prayer to Him. He hath ſo promiſed, He doth daily ſo perform, and the Church's experience in all ages aſſures us of the truth of the word He hath given us in that behalf. I confeſs, He doth not alwaies preſently give us what we crave. But if we be conſtant, if undiſmayed at His firſt denials, we preſs Him with a vigorous, and an ardent faith, there's nothing but perſeverance will draw it from His bounty,
<note place="margin">Gen. 32.25, 26. Hoſ. 12.4.</note> in the end. It was thus that <hi>Jacob</hi> obtained the bleſſing he deſired. He wreſtled ſtoutly with GOD all night, and had power over Him, he wept, and begged favour, and conſtantly holding faſt his LORD, <hi>I will not let thee go,</hi> (ſaid he to Him) <hi>untill thou bleſs me.</hi> The <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> woman in the Goſpel took the ſame courſe, and was heard in like manner. She bore our Saviour's firſt put-offs without diſmay, and thoſe hard words, <hi>It is not good to caſt the childrens bread to dogs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 15.26.</note> aſtoniſh'd her not. She receiv'd this great blow without giving over; and her holy importunity came off victorious, having drawn from our LORD's mouth, that ſweet and deſirable anſwer, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith! Be it unto thee as thou wilt.</hi> Imitate this violence. It offends not GOD. It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Him. The LORD Himſelf commands it us expreſly, and teacheth us, that we ought to pray alwaies, and not faint, by the parable of that poor widow, whoſe importunity overcame the obdurateneſs of the unjuſt Judge, and drew that from him in the end, which neither fear of GOD, nor reſpect of men could ſway him to. This Judge was wicked and cruel, yet the perſeverance of a woman conquered him. How much rather ſhall ours bear away what we deſire of GOD, who is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and clemency its ſelf? As for that Judge, it was his nature, and the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his heart, that rendred him cruel and inexorable; But if the LORD grant not our firſt requeſts, 'tis not that He means indeed to be ſparing of His bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits towards us. (To ſay true, He is more willing to give them, than we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.) This in total, is but a myſterious act of His wiſdome; and by ſuch delays He would exerciſe our faith, enflame our deſires, and make tryal of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. He hides himſelf, that we might ſeek Him. He retires, that we might preſs after Him; and holds back His bleſſing, that we might pluck it from Him. His favours are no boons that ſhould be faintly deſired. We do not know the value of them, if we do not eſteem them worthy to be asked with inſtancy. The favours we ſue for at the Courts and Palaces of men, are verily but terrene things, things of little value, and of a ſhort and uncertain duration. Yet what do we not do to obtain them? We beſiege their gates in the morning early; we abide there till late at night; we ſuffer their put-offs, and diſdains, and oftentimes even their reproaches, and the outrages of their domeſticks. They drive us from them, they call us troubleſome people; they accuſe our hardineſs of impudence, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency. We ſwallow all theſe affronts; and after all, forbear not to come on
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50919:226"/>again, inventing, if it be poſſible, ſome new ſubmiſſion to ſoften them; ſo great and preſſing is our deſire of thoſe things which we petition them for. Chriſtians, do ye not bluſh at having more paſſion for things of the earth, then for things of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Are you not aſhamed to ſollicite the juſtice, or the favour of men, with more earneſtneſs, then the grace of GOD? To have more patience and perſeverance in ſeeking to win the heart of a worm of the earth, then to overcome the King of Kings? your ſalvation is concerned. The grace you crave of Him is the abolition of crimes, that merit an eternal death; and that which you ſollicite with Him, is not a piece of ground, or an houſe, or a ſmall ſum of money, or ſome years of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life, or liberty. It is Heaven and Eternity which you beg: the treaſury and palace of His CHRIST; the peace and joy of his Spirit, an immortal liberty, an immortal life and glory. It's for this, Beloved Brethren, that we ſhould be violent, eager, and obſtinately importunate. It's for this we ſhould ſpend days and nights in ſollicitation at the feet of GOD; and ſeize reſolutely on Him, and proteſt unto Him with a firm and fixed determination, that we will not quit Him till He accord our deſire. No, LORD, thou ſhalt not eſcape me. Either Thou muſt ſuffer day and night my importunities; or I obtain what I petition for. I will give thee no reſt, untill Thou haſt fulfilled the deſire of my heart. I will have it from Thine hand, or die begging it. Such, Chriſtians, is the perſeverance, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle commands us here, and again elſewhere, when he gives us order to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing.</p>
                     <p>I have only two advertiſements to add; The firſt is, that we may not underſtand theſe words, as if he obliged us to quit all other exerciſe, and lay aſide the labour of the callings in which GOD hath ſet us, and do nothing but pour out prayers; as they ſay, certain extravagant hereticks called the <hi>Eutiches,</hi> that is, the Prayers, did ſometime interpret it. The Apoſtle who orders us here to pray without ceaſing, commands us alſo to labour, and that with ſuch neceſſity, as he ſentences that man not to eat, who doth not labour. Theſe acts of our piety do not thwart one the other. Prayer ſeaſoneth and animateth labour; hindereth it not. That perſeverance in it, which is our duty, is not continued praying without intermiſſion, but prayer fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reſumed, and aſſiduouſly reiterated, ſo as neither the trouble of waiting, nor deſpair of obtaining, nor any other conſideration, makes us give over the diligent practiſe of it.</p>
                     <p>The other advice we have to give you in reference to this ſubject, is againſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, which regulateth prayers, you know, by the clock, and ſcrupulouſly ties men up to the number, and to the words of their oriſons. A Chriſtian, who hath his converſation in Heaven, above time, and the motions that make it, meaſures his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion by things themſelves, and makes his prayers, not at the toll of a bell, but at the ſignal of his need: he lengthens or ends them, not according to the number of beads in a chaplet, but according to the movings of his heart.</p>
                     <p>Now after Perſeverance in prayer, the Apoſtle requires alſo of us vigilancy in it. Perſevere in prayer, (ſaith he) watching in it, with thankſgiving. I freely yield, that the faithful may ſteal away ſome hours from their repoſe, and employ them in prayer; provided it be done without ſuperſtition. Nor do I deny, but that the Prophets and the Apoſtles, and the Chriſtians of the primitive Church often did ſo, riſing at night, and ſpending, either in private, or in their temples, ſome hours in prayer, and other exerciſes of piety. Yet it ſeems to me, that it is not of theſe watchings the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here. For there is another kind of Watch, which we may call the Watch of the Soul, and it's only an attention of mind, when we keep all our faculties in a good eſtate, lively and working, not aſleep, nor drown'd in idleneſs, or in love of the world, or in it's errors and vanities; but awake, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated unto GOD heeding him, and intent upon His work; looking unto CHRIST, and for His day, and expecting His ſalvation with earneſtneſs and conſtancy.

                        <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the faith, quit you like men, be ſtrong. Be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant. Bleſſed is he that watcheth.</hi> And the like often elſewhere. For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſomewhere elegantly ſays of a widow, who ſpends her time in the pleaſures of ſin, <hi>that ſhe is dead, while ſhe liveth;</hi> ſo may we ſay in like manner, of a perſon, that takes no thought of GOD, nor of his ſervice, nor minds the occaſions of doing good and holy works, how active, and buſie ſoever he otherwiſe is in the affairs of the world, that he ſleeps while he is awake. This myſtical ſleeping, is an inſenſibility of ſoul for the things of GOD. The waking, or watching oppoſite to it, is the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiveneſs, the ſenſibility, and the acting of the ſoul about the things of ſalvation. 'Tis true, this kind of watching is neceſſary for us in all the parts of our lives, and that no ſeaſon, no occaſion ſhould ever find a Chriſtian aſleep in this ſenſe. But as prayer is the excellenteſt of all our ſervices; ſo doth it particularly require of us, this watching, this attention. I account therefore, that it's preciſely this the Apoſtle means, when he commands us to watch in prayer. He would have us bring unto it a ſoul awakened, not overwhelm'd in the cares, and paſſions of the world; not loaden, and weighed down with thoughts of the fleſh; not ſpiritleſs and languid, but ſtretch'd forth, and lifted up to GOD; not heedleſs of what it doth, or heeding it by halves; but minding the things it asks of Him, and that CHRIST of his, in whoſe name it preſents it's requeſts to Him.</p>
                     <p>By which you may judge, what account we are to make of moſt mens prayers, that are pronounced by the mouth alone, without any attention of heart, for cuſtom rather then out of any ſolid devotion. Certainly ſince prayer ought to be made with watching thereunto, it is evident, that theſe peoples ſupplications are, to ſay true, dreamings, and not prayers. They are vain words, like to thoſe, which a man that dotes utters ſometimes in his ſleep. Thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> are ſo far from taking Chriſtians off from this abuſe, that they precipitate them into it, by that ſtrange and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant law for their ſervices, which orders the performing them to be in a language that the people underſtand not. Our hearts are ſo vain, that they can hardly keep cloſe to the things and words we underſtand. I beſeech you, what attention can they have for thoſe they underſtand not? And how do they watch in praying, that are ſo far from thinking upon what they ſay, as they know not what is meant? Pies and Parrots are capable of prayer, and of devotion, if the uttering of a few words without underſtanding them, be praying to GOD.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Apoſtle would have us further add to prayer, giving of thanks. And truly with great reaſon. For how can we ask of GOD new favours, if we make not our acknowledgments to Him for thoſe we have already received? This duty is ſo rational, that though no other conſideration did call for it, the thing it ſelf would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to perform it. The having receiv'd a benefit, is cauſe enough for rendring of thanks. It's an odious ingratitude, to have, and uſe the gifts of GOD, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing to Him our reſentments of them. But beſides ingratitude, it's impudence too, to preſent our ſelves to GOD and ask new benefits of Him, if we thank Him not for the old. It's herewith therefore, that all our prayers ſhould begin; and there is no kind of Rhetorique, ſo powerful to perſwade His giving for the future, as an acknowledgment of what is paſt. He loves to ſow His mercies upon ſuch ground, as receives them with gratitude: &amp; He readily hears the vows and prayers of thoſe, who have a deep and reſpectful ſenſe of the favours He hath done them. Now tell me not that ye have not yet received any thing from His liberality. There's not a man how wretched and forlorn ſoever, but this Divine Sun of grace, and bounty hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited and imparted ſome of his benefits unto. How much more hath he done it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, whom He hath honoured with his covenant? and unto whom He offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth His Goſpel, and his CHRIST, and in Him all the treaſures of His grace, and of His glory? For I omit this body and this ſoul, this breath and light, and that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other good things, which he communicateth unto all men in the courſe of nature. But how can you, without being dead, or at leaſt utterly ſtupid, have no reſentment of the grace He hath ſhewed you, in calling you to His communion? and thereby to the hope of ſalvation and eternity? Yet though he hath done you ſo many favours already, He forbids you not to crave more of Him. His goodneſs is an inexhauſtible deep. Beg and pray boldly. All that he requireth of you, is that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50919:227"/>ye do it with thanksgiving: that ye tender Him your reſentments for His firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, if ye would have Him grant the requeſts ye make Him for further graces. This is it, Dear Brethren, which the Apoſtle enjoyns the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> concerning prayer in general, even that they perſevere in it, and watch unto it with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</p>
                     <p>He next ſollicits them, in the ſecond part of our Text, to pray particularly for Him. <hi>Pray ye</hi> ſaith he) <hi>together alſo for us; that GOD do open,</hi> &amp;c. As to this, I will not ſtay to chaſtiſe the ſilly ſubtility of the ſuperſtitious; who do conclude, from the Apoſtle's requiring the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to pray for him, that therefore we may alſo pray the ſpirits of the faithful departed, which are in Heaven, to do us the ſame office. As rationally, as if I ſhould infer, from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s writing this Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that therefore we have warrant to write letters to the dead. Theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> demands the aſſiſtance of their prayers, were perſons living here beneath on earth; perſons, with whom he had mutual commerce in ſuch offices of charity. He wrote to them, they anſwer'd him. He knew his words would reach them, and he look'd again for theirs; whereas we have no ſuch commerce with the deceaſed. And as for the reply which is made, that they do know our deſires, and hear our prayers; it's a phanſie aſſerted without proof, and without reaſon; ſuch as nothing but the paſſion of a bad cauſe hath inſpired errour with: and which we may not believe, ſince the word of GOD, which is the rule and meaſure of our faith, ſays nothing of it. However it be, ſince GOD, who everywhere commands us to pray, doth no where order us to pray to men departed; ſince the Apoſtle, who preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and divers other believers that were alive, to pray unto GOD for him, doth no where ſollicite them, either by his order, or by his example to do him the like office, by addreſſing prayers to Saints deceas'd; we cannot be faulty in keeping religiouſly as we do to the commands of GOD, and the examples of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Saints of the Old and New Teſtament, who have indeed prayed unto GOD, and verily required the aid of the prayers of living faithful people; but never invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated or ſollicited the dead to pray for them. All that can be duly concluded from this example of the Apoſtle, is that while we war here below under the enſigns of JESUS CHRIST; the charity that uniteth us all into one body, obligeth us to pray for one another; and not only Paſtors for their Flocks, but alſo Flocks for their Paſtors. Who was then, or who hath ſince been greater then St. <hi>Paul?</hi> Yet you ſee how he diſdaineth not the prayers of private Chriſtians. He diſdaineth them not, ſaid I? He demands them, and requires them expreſly. Elſewhere he demands the ſame aſſiſtance of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence we may conclude, that for any one to have the title given him of a Mediator between GOD and us, it is not ſufficient that he pray unto GOD for us. For by this account, the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> praying for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> according to the warrant he gives them for it, and the requeſt he makes them about it, might, and ſhould be ſtiled his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours towards GOD; which is infinitely abſurd, as every one would confeſs. Whence firſt is refuted the abuſe of thoſe that give this glorious quality unto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, calling them Mediators between GOD and the people; an abuſe, againſt which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cried out long ago, ſaying, <q>That if any man boaſted,

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50919:228"/>in whom is the propitiation for our ſins;
<note place="margin">Ibid.

                     </p>
                     <p>But let us now ſee what prayers the Apoſtle requires of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and what particular he would have them crave of GOD for him. Being priſoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> one would think he ſhould deſire, above all things, to be ſet at liberty. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I beſeech you, the generoſity of this holy man, and how nobly he deſpiſeth the intereſts of the fleſh. He ſays nothing of this. He would have them entreat GOD to open him the door, not of his priſon, but of the word, that he may pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the myſterie of CHRIST. This is all his heart is ſet upon. He takes no thought for his eaſe, or liberty. He hath no ſentiment, nor deſire, but for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his miniſtery; that is, for the advancement of the glory of GOD, and for the edification of men. He is content, provided he may diſſeminate his Maſter's Goſpel with fruit. If his priſon hinder, that he doth it not with ſuch convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to ſuch a latitude, as he would were he free; in this caſe only, and out of no other deſign, would he have prayer made to GOD, to take him out of bonds. If not, his chain is indifferent to him, provided it obſtruct not the courſe of the Goſpel, and that notwithſtanding his bonds, the word of GOD be not bound.
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.9.</note> This is all he craves of the LORD, and all that he deſires others ſhould crave for him, that He open (ſaith he) the door of this word; that is, give him in His providence, the opportunity and ability to preach it, removing from before him the averſion, and hatred, and fury of men againſt this holy doctrine, and thoſe other ſcandals which the Devil never faileth to raiſe in its way, as ſo many thick and impenetrable gates, to hinder this Divine ſcepter of CHRIST from entring in among men, and accompliſhing the good pleaſure of GOD upon them.

It is called a myſterie, both here, and alſo often elſewhere; becauſe it is a wiſdom hidden of its ſelf to men and Angels;
<note place="margin">Eph. 6.19 Rom. 16.25.

                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> He gives us the ſumm of it in another Text, where he clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth what this myſterie of CHRIST is; <hi>Without contradiction,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>great is the myſterie of godlineſs; GOD manifeſted in fleſh, juſtified in Spirit, ſeen of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the World, and raiſed up into glory.</hi> Now he calls this grand ſecret, the myſterie of CHRIST; firſt, becauſe JESUS CHRIST is all the fulneſs thereof, that is, the ſole ſubject that fills up the whole of it. Whence it comes alſo, that the Apoſtle, who was an excellent, and moſt conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Preacher of it,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2.</note> for the right diſcharging of his Office, does determine to know nothing among thoſe he preached to, but <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST crucified.</hi> Secondly, becauſe it's the LORD JESUS who firſt reveal'd it unto men; who brought it out of the abyſſes of the Divine wiſdome,
<note place="margin">Rom. 16.25.

It's not in vain, that the Apoſtle ſays
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50919:228"/>here by the way, he is a priſoner for this Goſpel of his Maſter's. For what alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation could be more proper, or more potent to affect the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and render them prompt, and earneſt to pray unto GOD for him, and for the progreſs of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, than a remonſtrance, that it's for this holy, and glorious cauſe he ſuffers? And that this myſterie of CHRIST, which he ſo paſſionately deſires he may report, is ſo divine a thing, as he ſtuck not to ſeal the truth of it, by a conſtant and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious enduring of the captivity he was in? But after this opening the door of the word, the Apoſtle would have the faithful crave of GOD further, that he may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Goſpel as he ought to ſpeak; that is, preach it in ſuch a manner, as may be worthy of ſo ſublime a ſubject; with meet liberty, diligence, and fidelity. For it's not enough to have once receiv'd of GOD gifts neceſſary for the executing of this holy office, except he conſerve them in us by a continual influx of His light, and give us the courage, the zeal, and ſpiritual prudence, to uſe them in ſuch ſort as is proper for the edification of men.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee, Beloved Brethren, what the Apoſtle e're-while demanded of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> both in general, and for himſelf in particular. Make account, that this great Miniſter of CHRIST doth now demand the ſame things of you, by our mouths; in general, that <hi>ye perſevere in prayer, watching thereto with thanksgiving;</hi> and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that <hi>ye pray for us, who have the honour to preach the Goſpel to you.</hi> As for prayer; we have afore ſufficiently juſtified the neceſſity of it to you. It remains only, that you make your profit of it; that this holy exerciſe be ordinary in your families; that this ſacrifice be there daily offered unto GOD morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that ye do not undertake, nor begin any thing, before ye have dedicated it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD by prayer. Inſtruct your children and ſervants in the ſame devotion: That there may not be a perſon within your doors, but underſtands, and exerciſeth himſelf in this divine liturgie of all Chriſtians. Then take heed to acquit your ſelves in this duty as you ought; that is, to perform it with fervency, attention, vigilancy, and perſeverance; to waſh your hands in innocence, to purifie your ſouls and bodies, for the preſenting them unto this ſupreme and moſt holy Divinity, without offending His ſight. Ye know what the Prophets ſay of thoſe whoſe hands are full of blood; even that <hi>they are an abomination to the LORD;</hi> that He is weary to bear them; that He abhorreth their devotions, and diſdaineth their vain oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that He hides His face from them, when they dare ſtretch out their polluted hands unto Him; and will not hear their prayers, though they ſhould multiply them to the utmoſt. <hi>Waſh you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>make you clean,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.11, &amp; ſeq.</note> 
                        <hi>take away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well; ſeek judgement, relieve the oppreſſed, do right to the orphan, debate the eaſe of the widow.</hi> This, Chriſtians, is the incenſe wherewith the LORD would have you perſume your offerings of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that they may be pleaſing to Him. Hearken to His voice, if you deſire He ſhould hear yours. Obey the word of His Goſpel, if you would have Him receive the words of your ſupplications. We complain that we have long prayed in vain. But let us not diſparage His veracity; rather confeſs we have not prayed as we ought; that is, with ſuch faith, ſuch repentance, and amendment of life, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſhould have accompanied theſe ſacrifices. Henceforth then (for it is yet time) turn ye unto Him with all your heart, and lift up pure hands, without wrath, and doubting; and vigorouſly perſevere in this holy exerciſe, with aſſurance that He will hear you.</p>
                     <p>But, Dear Brethren, among other things which you ſhall crave of GOD, pray Him alſo for us, that He would open us the door of the word, to the end we may declare the myſterie of CHRIST, and manifeſt it to you as we ought. For if <hi>Paul,</hi> a choſen veſſel, made, and formed immediately by the hand of Heaven, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by CHRIST's own voice, and fill'd with the treaſures of His Spirit in all abundance, did notwithſtanding require the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> prayers, in the adminiſtration of this charge; how much more is the ſuccour of yours neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us; for us, I ſay, who, in compariſon of him, are but children? We conjure you therefore, both by the glory of our common Maſter, and by the intereſt you have in His work, that you never fail to remember us in your ſacrifices of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but alwaies beſeech this ſupreme LORD, to perfect His ſtrength in our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50919:229"/>to give us a mouth fit to declare His myſteries, and to purifie our lips, as He ſometime did His Prophets, and untye our tongue, as He did <hi>Moſes</hi>'s; and fill our ſouls with that Divine fire, which heretofore did, in a moment, form His Apoſtles; clearing up our minds unto a diſtinct knowledge of His Goſpel wiſdom; inflaming our hearts with the zeal of His houſe, and cleanſing them from the filth of all humane paſſions. Now if the LORD, inclined by the ardency and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of your prayers, do vouchſafe to conferr upon us ſome ſmall portion of His grace, look ye on it as a thing that pertains to you; a thing given to your prayer, and for your edification. Uſe it, and make advantage of it. Let it not be ſaid, that this great myſterie of CHRIST was declared unto you in vain; and that it being manifeſted to you as it ought, ye received it not as you ſhould. GOD keep you from ſuch an unhappineſs. For how weak ſoever our preaching be, it is notwithſtanding ſufficient, My Brethren, to render every one inexcuſable, who ſhall not have received it with faith; neither your ears nor conſciences being able to deny, but that we declare unto you all the counſel of GOD in His Son JESUS CHRIST. Let us all in common beſeech Him to deal ſo graciouſly with the one and the others of us, that all may rightly diſcharge their duty; we ſpeak unto you, ye hearken unto us, as is meet: and that being knit together by a firm and indiſſoluble Charity, we may proſperouſly advance His work in all ſanctity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, patience, and conſtancy, to the glory of His Name, the edification of thoſe among whom we live, and our own ſalvation. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; while the Church of CHRIST is here on earth, it's condition is, to ſojourn for the moſt part amid people of another profeſſion. For though the merit of our LORD and Saviour be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to bring all mankind unto the communion of GOD, and though his ſalvation be tender'd by His own will and order, to all thoſe, that have His Goſpel preached to them; yet ſo horrible is the obduration and blindneſs of our nature, that the moſt of men abide out of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of GOD, wickedly and fooliſhly rejecting the great honour He offers them. Divers whole Nations there are, that irritated with the ſame fury, have utterly ſhut the door againſt JESUS CHRIST, refuſing to ſuffer any of His ſervants within their coaſts. And even of thoſe, in which He hath ſome reception, it is commonly but a little part that doth acknowledge Him, the greateſt and moſt conſiderable in the world, perſecuting Him, or deriding His myſteries. Not ſo much as private fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but the Goſpel ſometimes makes this partition in. The ſame roof often cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth perſons of different religions. 'Tis a diviſion, which JESUS CHRIST hath raiſed in the world; not that He poſitively willed, and deſign'd it; or that ſuch is the nature of His doctrine; (neither of thoſe doth properly tend, but to unite all things, and recombine Earth with Heaven in an eternal peace) but it grows from the naughty and the cruel diſpoſition of men, who deſpiſe His counſel, and diſdain their own ſalvation. Once by this means it com's to paſs, that the Kingdom of CHRIST remains, as it were inlock'd with forcin States, and His faithful ones mingled among perſons of a contrary religion; with whom this commune habitation doth of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity oblige them to have much commerce.</p>
                     <p>This is the reaſon why the Apoſtle having regulated afore moſt of the duties of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50919:230"/>our life, do's here in a few words point out, in what manner we ſhould converſe with theſe aliens, as to faith, among whom we are diſperſed. And this advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was at that time the more neceſſary, for that Chriſtians in thoſe beginnings, which were as the nativity of the Church, ſaw themſelves environed on all ſides with Jews and Pagans; the two religions, which then took up the whole univerſe. In a peculiar manner the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to whom he writes this Epiſtle, they dwelt in a City, and a Province, of which the people were much addicted to the moſt infamous of heatheniſh ſuperſtitions. He commands them, firſt in general, to walk wiſely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that are without, and redeem the time. Next he orders them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to have care of their ſpeech, one of the principal, and moſt important pieces of the commerce we have with men. <hi>Let your ſpeech</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be alway with grace, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with ſalt, that ye may know how to anſwer every one.</hi> This exhortation, My Brethren, doth well fit our ſelves, and is proper for the condition we are in: as who live under powers, and among countreymen of a religion different from ours. Let us conſider it therefore, and practiſe it with care. To help you for a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, we ſhall, if GOD will, treat in the preſentation of the two parts it containeth. Firſt, our converſation with thoſe that are without in general: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the qualities in particular, which our ſpeech ought to have in that converſe; noting to you upon each of 'em, what we ſhall judge proper for your edification and comfort.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle's general exhortation conſiſteth in two heads: the firſt is, that we walk wiſely towards thoſe that are without; the ſecond, that we redeem the time. As to the firſt, I preſume you all know without my advertizing it, that the Apoſtle here do's ſignifie by the word, walking according to the ordinary ſtile of Scripture, living and converſing; and again, that he means by thoſe that are without, ſuch as are not of our communion, but do, in point of religion, follow other ſentiments and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, then we profeſs to embrace in conformity to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. He gives them the ſame denomination in another Epiſtle alſo, where after his ordering us to ſhun the commerce and frequentation of ſome that are called brethren, that is, who make profeſſion of our communion,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.12.</note> but mean while lead an ill, and ſcandalous life, he addeth; <hi>For what have I to do to judge of them that are without?</hi> He willeth then that we converſe wiſely with them, that is, that in all negotiation and converſing with them, we exerciſe a great deal of prudence and circumſpection. Not that he permits us fooliſh and indiſcreet deportment towards the faithful, that are of the ſame body with us. GOD forbid. A Chriſtian's whole life ought to be prudent and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed; and whomſoever he converſeth with, he ought to govern his actions with judgment, and do nothing without reaſon, remembring the rule his Maſter gave him for the forming of all his carriage, <hi>Be ye wiſe as ſerpents</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>and ſimple as doves.</hi> But becauſe they without are uſually enemies to our religion, and do deteſt, or at leaſt are ignorant of, or deſpiſe its myſteries, there's none but ſees that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, in treating with them, to uſe much more reſtraint and conſideration, then when queſtion is of our brethren. As when a Souldier is in an enemy's countrey, he ſtands much more upon his guard, and marcheth, as they ſay, with bridle in hand. Beſides you know, if perſons be but ſtrangers, we treat them with more care, and if I may ſay it, with more ceremony then our acquaintances. A brother lives with us without deſign; a ſtranger is a ſpy. The one bears with even thoſe actions of ours, in which a ſevere Judge would find ſomething to reprehend. The other doth not pardon us any thing; nay, is offended ſometimes at the innocenteſt actions. Being perſwaded of the charity of the former, we live ſecurely with him; nor doth his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon put us in pain, becauſe he approves all that accords with our rule. With a ſtranger it is not ſo. Beſides the care we ought to have, that in all tranſactions with him, we do well; we muſt alſo be further heedful, that we ſo do all, as may be to his guſt. It's then with a great deal of reaſon, that the Apoſtle advertiſeth us, as to thoſe that are without, to live and converſe wiſely with them in a particular manner, that is, to exerciſe in all our deportment towards them, more attention, prudence, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then in the other ordinary paſſages of our lives.</p>
                     <p>The firſt point of Chriſtian wiſdom in this deportment towards them, is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the end it ought to be directed to. The ſecond, to diſcern the perſons; And
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50919:230"/>the third, to chuſe ſuch means as are proper for our deſign. As to the end whether an accidental encounter do caſt us upon treating with ſuch as are without, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome deſign doth lead us to it, we ought alway to aim in it, either at the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and winning them to CHRIST, or at the leaſt, to hinder their taking any offence or diſguſt at our religion. In the commerce, which the ſubjects of a civil ſtate have with foreiners, it is enough that they keep ſound and entire, the fidelity they owe their Prince, and the love and reſpect they have for their Laws and Government of their own Countrey. It is not neceſſary, nor will it be ſuffered, that they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to withdraw a ſtranger from his ſubjection to that power, under whoſe Scepter he was born; becauſe it's a lawful ſubjection, and whoever would unfix it, do's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon anothers right, which cannot be done without injuſtice. But in the matters of religion it is not ſo. It's not enough that you preſerve your ſelves from theirs, who are without, you muſt endeavour, if you can, to draw them from it, and bring them over unto yours. For in this you do no one wrong: you hurt nothing but errour; nor diminiſh any's right, but ſuperſtition's, impiety's, and Satan's the common enemy of Mankind, who inſpireth them. You do not acquire any thing to JESUS CHRIST, but what did lawfully pertain unto him, ſince He of right, is LORD of all men; both by reaſon that He did create them, and alſo for that he hath redeemed them. You do an act of juſtice in reducing bond-ſervants under their true and lawful Maſter's yoke, whom errour had debauched from it. Thus as often as you treat with thoſe that are without, you ought to propoſe unto your ſelves the edifying of them in reference to religion, and to have a will, and a deſire in your hearts, like to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s wiſh for <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and for the reſt that heard him;
<note place="margin">Act. 26.29.</note> 
                        <hi>I would to God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that not only thou, but alſo all that hear me this day, were both almoſt, and altogether ſuch as I am, except theſe bonds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it's not enough to have a good end: there muſt be an application of proper and fit means; and for this effect the diverſity of the perſons, with whom we have to do, is to be heedfully conſidered. For the ſame things do not ſuit with all. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom therefore, being obliged to diverſifie its conduct, according to the difference of thoſe with whom it treateth; a Chriſtian muſt, together with that good intention, he bringeth with him unto ſuch encounters, diligently diſcern the perſons he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with; not only in reſpect of the different conditions they are of in the world, or in reſpect of their diverſe capacity, but alſo principally in regard of their humour, and their diſpoſition in reference to religion. For they that are without, have not all of them an equal averſion for ours. There are ſome that have a ſweet, and an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and tractable ſpirit, and that hate not our perſons, though they approve not our ſentiments. There are others, that are furious, and look not upon us but as monſters, whom they could with all their hearts, as one may ſay, devour. For it's the property of errour, and of ſuperſtition, to inſpire their zealots oftentimes with theſe cruel and inhumane paſſions. You ſhall again meet with ſpirits, who though perhaps they riſe not to this exceſs of rage, yet are retchleſs and obſtinate, and having ſmothered, or as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, fear'd up with an hot iron all ſentiments of true conſcience, reaſon, and honour, are wilfully become a prey to errour, and have ſtop'd up their ears, and all the entrances into their underſtandings againſt the words, and lights of truth, with a determinate reſolution, not to admit any thing that croſſeth their opinions, and rather to renounce the quality of reaſonable creatures, then the maxims of their falſe religion. That there muſt be very different demeanour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe diverſe ſorts of perſons, there is no one but ſees. And our ſaviour plainly tells us as much, when notwithſtanding the order He gives His Apoſtles, to publiſh His truth on the houſe tops, He yet adviſeth them expreſly elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.6.</note> 
                        <hi>not to caſt their pearl before ſwine;</hi> and the reaſon He annexeth is conſiderable, <hi>leſt</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>they tread them under their feet, and turn again, and rend you:</hi> plainly ſignifying by theſe words, as experience ſufficiently confirms, that the ſpirits of thoſe He ſpeaks of, are irritated and inflamed by that very endeavour, which is uſed to cure them; and that they are ſo far from amending, as they become more fierce, and more cruel upon it. But now this diſcrimination of perſons is not made for the having in ſequel the liberty to hate the one, and love the other. For a Chriſtian's religion permitteth him not to hate any man; it indiſpenſibly obligeth him to love all, whatever be their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50919:231"/>nature, or their religion, or their diſpoſition towards us: yea, it requireth him, even <hi>to bleſs thoſe that curſe him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5.44.</note> 
                        <hi>and do good to them that perſecute him,</hi> and make prayers and votes for them that crucifie him. He conſiders not theſe differences of men, but for the regulation of his deportment; for the diverſifying, not of the paſſions of his heart, but of the actions of his life towards them. For though his carriage be different in one manner to ſome, and in another manner to others; yet his heart is the ſame towards all; and to ſay true, it's the love he hath for them, rather than any other reaſon, that makes him to deal diverſly with them.</p>
                     <p>To come then unto the choice of ſuch means as are neceſſary, and may be ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the end that we propoſe unto our ſelves in this kind of carriage: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian wiſdome excludes from the number, firſt, all evil actions, all actions that are contrary to piety, or juſtice. We owe this reſpect, not only to GOD and our own conſciences, but alſo to men, and eſpecially to ſuch as are without, that we at no time do any ill before them. For unjuſt or impious actions, beſide the venome they have in themſelves, have alſo this bad property, that they are directly contrary to the end we ought to have in our deportment towards perſons without; which is (as we have ſaid) the winning them to CHRIST. Inſtead of attracting, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on, ſuch actions drive them off, and diſguſt them at the thing, inducing them to judge ill of our religion, by the ill fruits it produceth in us, and to ſuſpect that our belief is like our works, and our Goſpel as falſe as our lives are foul. It was one thing that <hi>Nathan</hi> noted in King <hi>David</hi>'s ſin. <hi>Thou haſt made enemies</hi> (ſaith he,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.14.</note> 
                        <hi>to blaſpheme the Name of GOD;</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the evil lives of the Jews. <hi>Thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that makeſt thy boaſt of the law,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 23.24.</note> 
                        <hi>by tranſgreſſing the law, diſhonoureſt thou GOD? For the Name of GOD is blaſphemed, becauſe of you, among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> The Heathen heretofore took like offence at the debauches of bad Chriſtians, and did not forbear to reproach them with it. The men vant (ſaid they) that they are delivered from the tyrannie of Satan, and dead unto the world; yet their affections and luſts do no leſs overcome, and maſter them, than ours do us, whom they call ſlaves of Satan. For what ſerves this Baptiſme, wherewith, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, they have been waſh'd; and that Spirit, which, as they ſay, doth govern them; and that Goſpel, which they make ſo great a noiſe withal, ſince their whole life is full of filth, and fleſh, and diſorder? Accordingly you ſee, how the Apoſtle, among other reaſons which he alledgeth to divert the faithful from things contrary to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and honeſty, doth not forget to urge this for one, that <hi>the Name of GOD</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and his doctrine be not blaſphemed;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.1.</note> and in another place, that <hi>the word of GOD be not blamed;</hi> and a little after, that <hi>ye may make the doctrine of GOD our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our honourable in all things.</hi> So the firſt thing we owe to thoſe that are without, is a pure and conſtant innocence in all our treating with them. The beginning, and the firſt point of prudent converſe in this behalf, is, that we neither ſay nor do any thing in all the communication we have with them, which they may juſtly accuſe of wanting devotion towards GOD, or of covetouſneſs, or cruelty, or any other unſeemly or unjuſt paſſion towards themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But after abſtinence from evil, we owe them alſo the performing and practiſing of that which is good; firſt, by rendring to them readily and uprightly all that is their due by the laws of GOD, and of Nations; to Princes, fidelity and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; to Magiſtrates, reſpect; to Kindred and Countrey-men, amity; each in their degree:
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.7.</note> and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith elſe-where, <hi>tribute, cuſtome, fear, honour, to whomſoever either of 'em doth belong, not defrauding any one of his right, nor lying indebted unto any.</hi> Let Soveraigns ſee us zealous for their ſervice; private men, round, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and truſty in all the affairs we have with them; religious obſervers of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and our words; honeſt debtors; milde, and humane creditors; courteous and helpful neighbours. Let them not find us faulty, in reference to any of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of an honeſt, and a civil life. For GOD forbid that we ſhould ever admit into our hearts, ſo impious, and barbarous, and inhumane a conceit, as ſome do har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, namely, that it is lawful to break promiſe with ſuch as are without, and to deceive, or uſe a perſon ill, when we can plead that he is not of our communion. On the contrary, it's to theſe that we muſt ſhew moſt juſtice and integrity: theſe, of all men, are the perſons towards whom we muſt acquit our ſelves of all that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50919:231"/>we owe them, with greateſt religiouſneſs and ſcruple. And he that thinks to draw me to ſide with him, by an act of injuſtice, or cruelty, or perfidiouſneſs, is ſo far from gaining any thing that way, that he makes me believe with a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the religion which permits him ſuch things, and excuſeth them under colour of a good intention, and pretends them ſerviceable for greater glory to GOD, is an impious, and abominable ſuperſtition, and much worſe in this particular, than the ſects and diſciplines of Pagans themſelves, who, how ignorant ſoever they were, yet never held any of theſe horrible maxims. GOD will not be ſerv'd at all with unrighteouſneſs, and treacheries; and to make account, or aſcribe to Him that He taketh pleaſure in ſuch ſervices, is one of the greateſt outrages that can be done Him. They are grateful to the devil, and to none but him. A Chriſtian looks not upon any man on earth as his enemy; he knows that they are all the creation of the LORD his GOD, and that his Maſter died for them, and ſhed His blood to ſave them. He reſpects this character in them, however disfigured by vice, or error. And his rendring them theſe dues, is not out of a fear he hath of their power, or their ill will; as ſome would perſwade us, that the primitive Chriſtians ſubmitted not to their heathen Emperors, and Magiſtrates, but only out of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or rather a world-like craftineſs, becauſe they were the ſtronger, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the weaker; and that had they had the means, they would have pluck'd the ſcepter out of their hands, and without ſcruple trampled that diadem under foot, which they made ſemblance to honour with ſuch humbleneſs. No, dear Brethren, this is not the nature, or the foundation of a Chriſtian's carriage towards thoſe that are without. It is GOD, it is his conſcience, and not ſimply ſome other conſideration that obligeth him to live with them, as he doth; according to the Apoſtle's doctrine in another place, where he ſays, <hi>we muſt be ſubject,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 13.5.</note> 
                        <hi>not only for wrath,</hi> that is, for fear of vengeance, and of the ſword which the Magiſtrate bears in his hand, <hi>but alſo for conſcience ſake;</hi> which in like manner extendeth to all other duties; that is, we muſt pay our creditors, keep our word, perform our promiſes, honour our fellow-ſubjects, live honeſtly with them, though they be not of our religion; not only for avoiding of the evils we ſhould incurr by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it not, but alſo for conſcience ſake; ſo as what impunity, yea, what ſalary ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we might expect for neglecting ſuch duties, we yet do never neglect them, accounting our ſelves bound to do them by a ſupreme and indiſpenſable law, namely, the juſt and holy will of GOD.</p>
                     <p>But beſides theſe things which we owe, Chriſtian prudence, in its conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe without, maketh uſe of others alſo, which in rigour of right, we owe not. For in this behalf, it aimeth not ſimply at our diſcharging our ſelves, but at the winning of thoſe whom we treat withal; ſo that if any thing, unto which otherwiſe juſtice obligeth us not, may be ſerviceable to this its end; that reaſon is that reaſon is ſufficient to make us do them. On which account it opens the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of our humanity, courteouſneſs, and beneficence to thoſe that are without, to give them all the aſſiſtance, favour, and ſuccour that we can, in their need, as often as they ask it of us, yea, when they ask it not. We ſhould in this caſe imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the goodneſs of our LORD, who maketh His Sun to ſhine, and His rain to fall even on them that blaſpheme Him. Make me not thoſe frigid and frivolous excuſes; that they are out of our communion; that they hate us; that they do us evil; that they are ungrateful. This is good diſcourſe for a worldling; who meaſures his <hi>devoirs</hi> by nothing but his own intereſt. As for you, that are a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of JESUS CHRIST, it's the leaſt thing you ſhould conſider. You ſhould principally reſpect the glory of GOD, the ſervice of his Son, and the edification of men. Do you good to all, as your Heavenly Father doth; diſdain no one whom He hath made. Account any one your neighbour that hath need of you, be he Samaritan, or Pagan. It imports not, ſo he be a man. There is nothing more effectual to perſwade him that your religion is holy, and divine, than this vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and generous deportment. At leaſt you will hereby take from him all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of calumniating your profeſſion. You will remain juſtified in his thoughts, and oblige him, if he be ever call'd to give teſtimony of you, to ſpeak in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and honourable language, which the probity, and innocence of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50919:232"/>beleevers ſometime drew from the mouths of Pagans, ſuch a one is a good man, and there is nothing to be blamed in him, but that he is a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>Again, for our living prudently with thoſe that are without, it's one principal duty incumbent on us, to accommodate our ſelves to them, as far as piety will permit; not needleſly contrarying them at any time; nay, willingly yielding them ſome part of our rights; bowing, and conforming themſelves to their laws, their humours, and wills, in things indifferent; that they may ſee it's not capriciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor hatred, but the force of our conſciences alone, that conſtraineth us to diſſent from their religion; and that ſetting this aſide, and our conſciences ſalved, there is nothing but we would both do and ſuffer to pleaſure them. Such was the Apoſtle's practice; and he hath left us an excellent pattern of this holy prudence, which he propoſeth, and repreſenteth at large, in the ninth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians. I have made my ſelf</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a ſervant to all,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.19, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>that I might gain the more. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Jews, I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; and unto the Law, as if Jew, that I might gain the more. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Jews, I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; and unto them that are under the Law, as if I were under the Law; to them that are without the law, as without the law, to the weak, became I, as weak; and all things to all men, that in concluſion I might ſave ſome.</hi> Imitate we this holy example of the Apoſtle: only take heed to limit, as he did, this complacentialneſs unto things which we have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpoſe of; that is, ſuch as are free, and indifferent for us; not exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to thoſe that are evil, and prohibited in the School of CHRIST, as contrary to piety, or ſanctification; remembring the leſſon which the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> elſe-where gives us,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.14, 15.</note> that <hi>there is no participation between righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs; nor communion between light and darkneſs; nor accord between CHRIST and Belial.</hi> In fine, this prudent demeanour towards thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, which he here preſcribeth us, doth require, that we avoid, as much as is poſſible, all actions and ſpeeches that offend them; and that, ſaving thoſe to which our religion doth neceſſarily, and inevitably oblige us, there eſcape us not any that may diſpleaſe them.</p>
                     <p>The clauſe, <hi>redeeming the time,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſubjoyns, containeth the utility and fruit of this ſage and prudent demeanour, which he hath injoyned the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> towards thoſe that are without; the meaning is, that by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in that manner, they would gain time, and mitigate by ſuch an addreſs, the rigour of that difficult and dangerous ſeaſon which they lived in, and had the averſions and perſecutions of the heathen to ſurround them. I well know, there are, that expound theſe words otherwiſe. Some, as ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were to repair their loſs of the time paſt, by well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the preſent altogether in a good, an holy, and a prudent way of life. For this is that we commonly call, redeeming of time. Others with more colour ſay, the Apoſtle's intention is, that we ſhould ſeek, and purchaſe, even at the price of what is deareſt to us, occaſions to edifie thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and make no difficulty of loſing ſomewhat in matter of eſtate, or eaſe, or even in point of honour, or reputation, to get the means of obliging them. For it is true, that the word the Apoſtle uſeth here in the original, doth often ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, an occaſion, and opportunity, rather than time ſimply. But, not to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the one and the other of theſe two conceptions, though both of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable as to the thing, and Chriſtian, yet ſeems to me a little beſide the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's ſcope and intention here. Moreover, the Interpretation I propoſed at firſt, is more conformable to the ſtile of Scripture: For the phraſe which St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth in this place, is found word for word in the Greek Verſion of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> at the ſecond Chapter, where King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> tells the Chaldeans,
<note place="margin">Dan. 2.8.</note> 
                        <hi>He knew well they would redeem the time;</hi> meaning, as our Bibles have aptly rendred it, that <hi>they would gain time;</hi> that is, would fain eſcape, and ſmoothly get out of that ill piece of way, in which they perceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves put to ſuch a plunge. To the ſame ſenſe, the Apoſtle here, though in a very different ſubject, bids us <hi>redeem the time, by walking wiſely towards them that are without,</hi> that is, that we ſhould by ſuch prudent and dextrous conduct, ſweeten their ſpirits, and handſomely divert the ſtorm of their fury, as an ill
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50919:232"/>influence, which might overwhelm us, gliding gently on, and gaining time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till things, governed and ordered by the providence of GOD, have changed their poſture. It's alſo hereto, that that reaſon doth evidently referr, which the Apoſtle elſewhere annexeth to this very command, in a paſſage of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> conform, and parallel to our Text:
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.15, 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Walk heedfully</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not as fools, but as wiſe; redeeming the time; for</hi> (he adds) <hi>the daies are evil.</hi> He would have us uſe much circumſpection in the ordering of our lives, and redeem the time, becauſe it is evil; that is, troubleſome, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to paſs, by reaſon of their ill-diſpoſition towards us, among whom we live; they being ready at every turn to deſtroy us, upon the leaſt occaſion of exaſperation, and of executing their malevolence that we give them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a wiſe Mariner at Sea, when the wind ariſeth, and the waters threaten, and the preſages of a tempeſt do appear, he haleth in his ſails, and prepares; then accommodates himſelf to the violence of the waves, and lets drive a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, not daring to bear up full againſt it: all to gain time, and redeem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſuch care, and conduct, out of ſo ſad and angry a ſeaſon; like induſtry would the Apoſtle have us uſe, to ward off the blows, which the not-ſo-favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition of thoſe without towards us, doth menace: he would have us, not take all our liberty with them; but manage our words and actions pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, accommodating our ſelves the moſt we may, unto their temper, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all that is apt to provoke them; giving them no occaſion to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe upon us: that if it be poſſible, we may by ſuch holy and adviſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, gain time, and eſchew an ill encounter, and redeem our ſelves from the troubles and diſorders it threatens us withal. It's a reaſon of the command he gave us, to walk wiſely towards them that are without. For beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the glory of GOD, and of the edification of men, which calls for this endeavour at our hands, as hath been ſaid, our own good, our ſafety, and preſervation doth alſo neceſſarily oblige us thereunto; it being evidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to ſubſiſt, in the eſtate we moſt times are, if we do not with a great deal of heedfulneſs, and prudence, put by, and lenifie the ill affections of thoſe among whom we live, and upon whom, in an humane way, our lives and liberties depend.</p>
                     <p>But after this general exhortation, the Apoſtle makes us another, for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our ſpeech in particular, which we muſt now explain with all the brevity we may. Let your ſpeech (ſaith he) be alwaies ſteep'd in ſalt with grace, that you may know how ye ought to anſwer every one. I muſt needs ſay, that this is requiſite in all the diſcourſes of the faithful, whomſoever they ſpeak to: and that their mouth ought to be a treaſury of benediction, out of which ſhould iſſue not a word, but that is holy, and full of grace, and good (as the Apoſtle ſays elſewhere) to the uſe of edifying; that is, proper to edifie them that hear it. But as in the precedent verſe; though wiſdome be neceſſary in all the parts of our carriage, yet he gave it us in charge parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, in reference to our commerce with ſuch as are without. I count, that in like manner here, purſuing the ſame ſubject, he doth appropriate thoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, which ought to appear generally in all the words of our mouths, to that diſcourſe, and converſe in particular, which we have with perſons without. Beſides the continuation of his diſcourſe, which there's little likelyhood he ſhould here ſuddenly break off without reaſon; his adding that of anſwering every one, &amp;c. confirms me further in this opinion; thoſe words evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the anſwers we are to make to thoſe without, when they interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, or queſtion us about our religion; as appears by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s making uſe of wel-nigh the ſame words in the ſame ſubject, <hi>Be ready alwaies</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to anſwer every man that asks you a reaſon of the hope that is in you,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15.</note> 
                        <hi>with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and reverence.</hi> Now truly the Apoſtle had good reaſon to take the pains himſelf, to form our ſpeech on ſuch occaſions; namely, when we are to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe without, about our ſentiments in matter of religion. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is the tendereſt part of all our converſe with men; and that which would be managed with greateſt exactneſs. It is a very ſlippery paſſage, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50919:233"/>the events frequently are of great importance, and have long and conſiderable conſequences for good, and for evil, according to mens different carriage in it. And if there be any caſe, in which the tongue hath any reaſon to vant of great matters,
<note place="margin">Jam. 3.6.</note> as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, without doubt it is in this; an anſwer here, as it is qualified, being capable of amending, or empairing the condition of an whole Chriſtian people: a ſage and moderate diſcourſe having ſometimes aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ſtayd the perſecution of the Church, and appeaſed the rage of its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: whereas on the other hand, a ſpeech, though for ſubſtance true, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indiſcreet, and ill-placed, hath often inflamed the hatred of the mighty, and troubled the Church's peace, and cauſed a thouſand diſorders and deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations. The Apoſtle then would have us, on this occaſion, (that is, when we ſpeak with thoſe without) more than on any other, govern our lips with ſo much judgement, that there may not a word break out, but what is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned as it ought to be. <hi>Let your ſpeech</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be alwaies with grace, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with ſalt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He preſuppoſeth in the firſt place, and precedently to other things, that it have its principal vertue, to wit, truth, which is the ſoul of it; according to that general rule he elſewhere gives us,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.25.</note> 
                        <hi>to ſpeak truth, every one with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> But in conjunction herewith, his intention is, that our ſpeech have theſe two further qualities; firſt, that it be with grace; and ſecondly, that it be ſeaſoned with ſalt. The grace he requires in it, is not that which is given to a diſcourſe by the ornaments of Rhetorick, which reſpecteth only the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ear, and conſiſteth in a choice of elegant words, and in a ſweet and grateful compoſition. The grace a Chriſtian ought to ſeek for, and have in his ſpeech, is, ſo to utter truth, as it offend not the hearer; that it expreſs our minds without exulcerating his; that it have neither gall, nor venome, nor virulency; that it be ſimple, humble, and modeſt; without revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, without ſcoffing, and other ſuch ſtings as may inflame thoſe whom we ſpeak to. The other particular he addeth, namely, that it be well ſalted, that is, prepared, and as it were ſeaſoned with an exquiſite prudence, does referr to the ſame thing for ſubſtance; For as ſalt doth deſiccate meats, and eat out the moiſture and putrid humour of them, leaving a ſharpneſs in them pleaſing to the taſte: ſo this Chriſtian prudence, which he would have all our ſpeech imbued with, works out of it all that it might have in it ſuperfluous, and noxious; and tempers it in ſuch ſort, that the ſorce and vigour which it leaves it, pleaſeth the ſpirit, and enters gratefully into it. The maſters of common Rhetorick would too, that there be ſalt in their Scholars ſpeeches. But it is not that which muſt ſeaſon a Chriſtian's deliveries. By this ſalt which they make ſuch account of, they mean certain pleaſantneſſes that border upon raillery and jeſting. Expreſſions that are quick, but offend not; and touch the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but do not gall it. We for our part do paſs by this artifice, and draw the ſalt wherewith our ſpeeches are to be impregnated from a quite other vein; even an holy Chriſtian prudence, which avoids all that may diſpleaſe, or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize our neighbour, and chooſeth what is proper to edifie him, ſo ſeaſoning diſcourſe, that nothing unſavoury, or inſignificant be uttered, which might diſguſt him at our perſons, or our religion. This ſalt cleanſeth our talk; firſt of all diſcourſes, that are either noxious and dangerous, as thoſe that lead to viciouſneſs; or vain, and fruitleſs; and ſecondly, of all that may offend thoſe we talk with, and alienate them from our religion. For this end, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is neceſſary, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in the following clauſe: that you may know (ſaith he) how ye ought to anſwer every one. It's clear, that this grace of ſpeech ſeaſoned with ſalt, doth not teach us how we ought to anſwer every one; but on the contrary, this ſcience or knowledge, when we have it, ſeaſoneth our ſpeech with its neceſſary grace. So that, whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, that ye may know it; it muſt be underſtood of the event, and ſucceſs, as if he had ſaid, let your ſpeech be with grace, and ſeaſoned with ſalt, ſo as it may appear, you know how to anſwer every one. Or the word know, which he uſeth in the original, muſt be taken for as knowing, and as judging, and diſcerning how we ought to anſwer every man.</p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:50919:233"/>
                     <p>Firſt, his calling our diſcourſes an anſwering, does intimate, that we ſhould not caſt our ſelves upon ſuch kind of conferences inconſiderately; nor enter on them, but with judgement, and adviſedneſſe, being called to it, either by ſome one's demand, or by the voice of ſuch a neceſſary occaſion as obligeth us to ſpeak. Then again he ſhews us, that we ought to diverſifie our ſpeech, according to the difference of perſons; and in this it is, that that diſcerning of perſons, which we touched at afore, muſt do us ſervice. There are thoſe to be met with, whom it would be beſt not to ſpeak to at all. The diſpoſitions of ſome may ſuffer a firm and free diſcourſe. The temper of others requireth a more ſoft and tender treatment. As you ſee, that meats for ſeveral bodies muſt be diverſly prepared, according to their different conſtitution: ſo we ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly ſeaſon our ſpeech; according to the diverſity of ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>Such, Dear Brethren, is the holy and wholſome leſſon that the Apoſtle gives us in this place. Practice we it diligently, and regulate by it our ſpeech, and deportment, in all the commerce we have with thoſe without. Hide we not our ſentiments in religion from them; but explain our ſelves to them in ſuch a manner, as may be proper both for their edification, and our own ſatety. Firſt, let us never ſpeak of them but in ſeaſon, and when occaſion offers its ſelf for it; do it with that gravity and decency that's due unto ſo high, and ſo important a ſubject. Next, let us take out of our ſpeech, all the ſtings that might incenſe thoſe that hear us. Let not it have in it any thing reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or offenſive; any thing that ſcenteth of hatred, or contempt. Let it be ſweet, and full of affection, and reſpect. Let it bear the image of a well-diſpoſed, and a truly charitable ſoul, and breath nothing but the good, and the edification of our neighbour. And as for truths themſelves; let it diſcover, and with full liberty expoſe ſuch as are grateful to our adverſaries; as thanks be to GOD, there are many; in particular, I make bold to ſay, all thoſe that are principal, and eſſential in religion, about which they make no conteſt with us. As for others, which conſiſt in a rejection of their errors, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot but be odious to them, we muſt deliver our ſelves about them with much diſcretion; meekly ſhewing them the reaſons of our ſentiments, that they may ſee it is not out of wilfulneſſe that we depart from their belief, but by the conſtraint of neceſſary reaſon. Let us forbear atrocious and opprobrious terms; and keep a juſt medium between flattery, and unworthy complacenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which covers in ſilence, or diſguiſeth the malady on one hand; and indiſcreet, and furious zeal, which angers, and invenomes it inſtead of healing it on the other. Error is a ſore that muſt be neither neglected, nor roughly handled: it muſt be touch'd, but tenderly, and in ſuch a manner, as if poſſible, we do not in our medling with it, put the Patient to pain.</p>
                     <p>See how St. <hi>Paul</hi> took ſuch a caſe in hand. He was at <hi>Athens,</hi> a City full of ſo much impiety and idolatry, as cut him to the heart. And having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the offence he took at it; when they had brought him forth, and asked him, what then his doctrine was, he doth not tell them, that they were ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, and impious, and bruitiſh, to worſhip wood and ſtone: though all this was very true. But the prudent Miniſter of GOD, ſaw well, that if he had propoſed this truth ſo crudely to them, he ſhould have loſt himſelf, and not at all have edified them. What does he then? He gives them at firſt ſome praiſe, acknowledging that they were extreme devoutly given. Thereupon he tells them of that unknown GOD, to whom they had conſecrated an altar: and thence, dexterouſly takes occaſion to preach the true GOD to them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating the truth ſo skilfully to them, that to hear him ſpeak, one would think he had not brought it from abroad, but found it there among them. This truly was, ſpeech ſeaſoned with the ſalt of grace. Let us imitate, I beſeech you, Brethren, this rich example of prudence, and modeſty, rather than the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and indiſcretions of zeal without knowledge; which ſerve only to irritate thoſe that are without, and draw the bad effects of their averſion and hatred upon thoſe that are within. But let us have yet more care to order our waies than our words. We cannot uſher in our diſcourſes with a better, or more
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50919:234"/>perſwaſive preface, than a good, and holy life; if we walk wiſely with them that are without, (as the Apoſtle gives us in charge) if we eſchew not only evil actions, but thoſe alſo that have the appearance of ſuch, and are reputed of men to be ſuch; if we ſhew them nothing but piety, honeſty, humility, charity, meekneſs, and ſincerity; if we affectionately ſeek, and embrace occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to oblige them, and do them ſervice; if we patiently bear the offences they do us, and revenge not our ſelves, but by offices of beneficence. This conduct, if we follow it, will mitigate ſome of them, and entirely gain others. It will invite the King our Soveraign Lord, and His Miniſters, to continue, and more and more confirm to us, that ſweet and precious liberty of conſcience, which having been given us in this great Eſtate, by the clemency and wiſdome of his Fathers, hath been hitherto conſerved to us by his Grace. In fine, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will render our doctrine honourable in all things, and make the Name of the LORD JESUS, whom we ſerve, to be glorified: and being acceptable to Him, will draw down His benediction upon us; and after the firſt-fruits of His bounty, which He will make us taſte of in this life, introduce us one day, to the full, and eternal poſſeſſion of His immortal glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brethren; The infinite wiſdom of GOD is very clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in His works, not only by the admirable diſpoſition of the parts, whereof they are compoſed, and the exquiſite order, in which He hath ranked them together; but alſo in that there is not any thing about them, without its utility. View me the world, this vaſt and firſt maſter-piece of His hand; Conſider me the Scripture His other work, the ſecond, and more excellent diſcovery of His will and nature. You ſhall not obſerve ought in either of them but is of uſe, both for the compleating of the whole, and for the benefit and edification, and conſolation of men. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that among the parts of theſe two compoſures of GOD, there are ſome more uſeful, and more neceſſary than others; ſome, in which His wiſdom and goodneſs do ſhine bright, and beam forth an abundant light; others, in which, they are but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50919:235"/>dimly to be ſeen. However, there is not any, though little and dusky in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but hath its uſefulneſs. It concerns us therefore, not to deſpiſe one of them, but heedfully remark whatever of worth the Creator hath put in them all, that ſo we may, both give Him the glory of it, and by it benefit our ſelves. I deſire, the truth is, we ſhould inſiſt moſt upon thoſe, in which the wonders of this great Authors hand is moſt reſplendent; yet ſo, as we neglect not the reſt, when by His providence we meet with them.</p>
                     <p>In conformity to this order, having hitherto conſidered the divine inſtructions, both concerning faith and manners, which this Epiſtle of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> do's contain; we now preſent you the later part of it, wherein this holy man recommendeth certain particular perſons, &amp; ſaluteth others, both in his own name, and in the name of ſome of his friends, and collegues in the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST. Diſdain not, Dear Brethren, this concluſion of the Apoſtle's divine letter, nor do ye imagine, that it can yield you no profit, becauſe it is not ſo luminous, and quitting the rich, and weighty ſubjects, we have entertained you with, do's ſpeak of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only. Though it had nothing at all in it, but the names of ſome faithful men, yet would it merit conſideration. For if we take pleaſure in hearing, and learning the names of the Captains, the Officers, and the Miniſters of our ancient Kings, and even of ſtrange Princes, who have been any thing great, and illuſtrious in their times, as an <hi>Alexander,</hi> a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or ſuch others; how much more paſſion ſhould we have for thoſe, that had their ſhare in the fortune, and atchievments of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and held ſome rank with him in the houſe and ſervice of CHRIST, our ſupream and eternal Monarch? For I affirm, and every reaſonable perſon, that ſhall ſeriouſly conſider the thing, will accord with me, that the exploits of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his aſſociates, under the Name and Enſign of JESUS CHRIST, are much greater, and more admirable, than all the lofty deeds of the moſt renowned Conquerors. So that if the grandeur of a matter do give us the curioſity to inform our ſelves of the names, and qualities of thoſe that intervened in it, this alone ought to be no little ſatisfaction to us; even that we find, in this paſſage of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle, the names of ſeven or eight of theſe the LORD's generous warriers, who coming out of divers quarters to rank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on each ſide of our great Apoſtle, combated the enemy at <hi>Rome,</hi> (that is, in his ſtrongeſt Hold,) and there, maugre all his fury, planted the Empire, and the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of their Maſter.</p>
                     <p>But beſide the juſt and lawful contentment, that ſuch a knowledge may give us, this paſſage will alſo afford us divers other very uſeful inſtructions; the Spirit that guided this ſacred writer, promoting not a word, but is full of wiſdom, And this reverent opinion we ought to have of all things contained in the book of GOD. For as when in the ſhop of an intelligent and able Herbalift, you ſee dry and wither'd ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that have neither ſmell, nor taſt, nor colour, you believe however, that they have ſome ſecret vertue, which lies hidden under that poor and unpromiſing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; preſuming, that they would not elſe have been ever laid up in ſuch a place. So when in the holy Scriptures, you meet with ſome paſſage or other, that at firſt ſeems little worthy of conſideration; caſting (if I may ſo ſpeak) no ſmell, ſhewing no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to affect or excite our perceptive faculty; make account that under this ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attractive an outſide, there is undoubtedly ſome ſpiritual utility contained; for that JESUS, the ſovereign Phyſician of ſouls, hath laid up nothing in this divine ſhop of his, which is ſuperfluous, or without uſe. You will by experience find it true, if you take the pains to examine attentively, and (as our Saviour ſpeaks) to ſound this text of the Apoſtles, which containing only ſome recommendations and ſalutations, which are little conſiderable in appearance, will nevertheleſs afford you divers inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, very uſeful for the edification of your ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Now to eaſe you in this meditation, we will employ the preſent hour (by the will of GOD) in diſcovering to you ſome of the remarkableſt among them. And that we may proceed in it with ſome order, we wil handle the two parts of this text diſtinctly, the one after the other. In the firſt, which comprehends the firſt three verſes, the Apoſtle recommends to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> two conſiderable perſons, whom he ſent unto them, namely <hi>Tychicus</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus.</hi> In the ſecond, which extends through all the reſt of the Text as far as the twelfth verſe of the chapter, he preſents them the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50919:235"/>of certain faithful ſervants of GOD that then ſojourned at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; were near him. Upon the firſt of theſe two general heads, there inſtantly offers its ſelf to our obſervation, the zeal and affection of this holy man for his Maſter's flock, and withall, his wiſdom and ſpiritual prudence. He was priſoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the chains of <hi>Nero,</hi> uncertain of the iſſue of his captivity; perſecuted by the Jews, hated of the Heathen, and for a ſurcharge of affliction, turmoiled by the malevolence and cruel deſigns of ſome, that called themſelves Chriſtians. One would think, that in ſo great and ſo confus'd, and terrible a combate, he ſhould have minded himſelf only; and that he were in an eſtate to receive the ſuccours of other faithful men, but not give them his. Not a man of us, but finding himſelf in a like danger, would conceive himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd with for taking to heart the neceſſities of others, and believe he had juſt cauſe to gather up, and fix all his cares on his own need. But this holy Miniſter of GOD, to whom a moſt ardent charity did render the intereſts of his Maſter's ſheep much more ſenſible than his own, makes a quite different judgment in the caſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his irons, nor his priſon, neither the fury of the Jews, nor the cruelty of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, nor the inhumanity of falſe brethren, nor death, nor the ſword, that hung con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually over his head, are able to put one moment out of his heart,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.28.</note> that care of the Churches which held him, as he very truly ſaith elſewhere, inceſſantly beſieg'd from day to day, knowing then the trouble the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were in for him, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that falſe teachers made upon their ſaith, he contents not himſelf with writing this divine letter to them; that is, with ſending them in this paper a living and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant ſource of conſolation, and of ſuccour againſt the horror of perſecutions, and the impoſtures of ſeducers; he diſpatcheth alſo two meſſengers unto them, to inform them exactly of all the particularities of his impriſonment, to tell them by word of mouth divers things which could not be written; and to diſcourſe upon, and explain thoſe, which the brevity of a letter had not permitted him to enlarge. For that ſuch was the cauſe of his ſending them, himſelf doth expreſly declare. They ſhall adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you (ſaith he) of all affairs here; and ſpeaking of <hi>Tychicus,</hi> one of them. <hi>He ſhall let you know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all mine eſtate. For to this end have I expreſly ſent him unto you.</hi> In the following words again, he intimates another reaſon, that he might know (ſaith he) your ſtate. True it is, that there are ſome manuſcript Greek copies that read a little otherwiſe, namely, that ye might know our ſtate. [And verily it is thus the Apoſtle ſpeaks of his ſending the ſame <hi>Tychicus</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> I have ſent him to you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly (ſaith he) for this end that ye might know our ſtate.] But it imports not much which of theſe two ways we read the Apoſtles words. For there is fair probability, that as the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were in pain for him, ſo he was likewiſe in pain for them; both becauſe of the perſecutions, which the faithful were then everywhere ſubject to, and alſo for the trouble, which he underſtood that Church received from ſome falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; ſo that to ſatisfie this common and reciprocal deſire, which the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and he had to receive certain and exact news of one another, he ſent <hi>Tychicus</hi> to them, who might inform them of his, and underſtand theirs, to impart the ſame to him.</p>
                     <p>He adjoyneth the laſt and principal end in of ſending <hi>Tychicus, that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he might comfort your hearts.</hi> For it was certainly the conſolation of theſe faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the Apoſtle ſought. But (you will ſay) what conſolation could the report of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s affairs afford the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ſince <hi>Tychicus</hi> left him in priſon at <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, in the mouth of the Lyon, as himſelf ſpeaks in another place? Dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it is true, the Apoſtle did abide ſtill in that ſad eſtate for that time, and it's true, this was it the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were in pain for. But yet theſe two meſſengers had many things to ſay unto them, that were proper to mitigate their trouble, and to eaſe their pain; firſt, that the Apoſtle was ſtill alive, ſafe and ſound, as <hi>Daniel</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, in the den of Lyons; nay, that he was not without hope of being ſet at liberty. Then again, and which is the principal, that is faith and piety, were ſo far from being weaken'd by this rude tentation, that they were become more firm and lively then ever, ſhining in this tryal, as fine gold in the furnace; that inſtead of being afflicted at it himſelf, he comforted others; the ſpirit of GOD continually maintaining Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian joy and peace in his heart and this tribulation, and conſerving the ſame, freſh and full, as otherwhile the buſh of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the midſt of the fire. And laſtly, that if
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50919:236"/>his body was bound, yet the Goſpel was not ſo, the Apoſtle with an high and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible courage, frankly preaching in his irons, and changing by a Divine miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his priſon into a School of JESUS CHRIST; opening too, by the efficacy of his example, the mouths of many brethren to preach the word boldly without fear; his whole affliction ſerving by the providence of GOD, to a much greater advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.12.</note> as himſelf ſaith elſewhere. This relation, as you ſee, was very proper to conſolate the hearts of the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> not to ſpeak of the knowledge and capacity of <hi>Tychicus</hi> in the things of the Kingdom of Heaven; which furniſhed him abundantly, wherewith to do theſe faithful people this good office, in repreſenting to them the doctrine and the promiſes of our LORD and Saviour; the neceſſity and utility of the croſs;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.17.</note> the life and the crowns to which it leadeth us; and that eternal weight of an excellent glory, which this light and tranſient affliction worketh for us; and the like intimations, of which the whole Goſpel is full. For you may not imagine that this <hi>Tychicus,</hi> and this <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> whom he ſent them, were ſimple meſſengers, that had no other ability, then to make faithful report of what they had ſeen and heard of St <hi>Paul</hi>'s affairs. They were two excellent perſons, endowed with great gifts of GOD, and well inſtructed in the knowledge of him; yea, as it is certain of the one, and very probable of the other, called to the holy miniſtry. And it further heighthens the Apoſtles charitable affection towards the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive himſelf for their conſolation of the preſence and aſſiſtance of two ſuch perſons, at a time, when they were ſo ſweet and ſo neceſſary to him.</p>
                     <p>But his prudence appears no leſs in this choice, then his affection and goodneſs. Firſt, more generally, in that he employ'd about this affair, perſons proper for the end, for which he ſent them. And ſecondly, in particular, that one of the two whom he choſe, to wit, <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> beſide other qualities he had, was a <hi>Coloſſian,</hi> and therefore a perſon that ſhould have the more credit with them, as their own countryman. It is true, that <hi>Epaphras,</hi> of whom he will afterward ſpeak, had the ſame quality. But it ſeems that a particular conſideration withheld the Apoſtle from employing him in this commiſſion. Even that he had already exercis'd the holy Miniſtry among the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and preached that very Evangelical doctrine to them, which was now trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by falſe teachers as we underſtand by the firſt Chapter of this Epiſtle. He then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſſed, and as it were a party in the quarrel, the Apoſtle do's very prudently, in employing other perſons, namely <hi>Tychicus</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> that ſo their faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine appearing conform to <hi>Epaphras</hi>'s, the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might the more eaſily perceive that his was not particularly his own, but in truth the LORD CHRIST's and his Apoſtles; and that, as the Scripture faith, in the mouth of theſe two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the word might be eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle, to give them credit with the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and render their Miniſtry fruitful to them, advertiſeth them of the good and recommendable qualities each of them. As for <hi>Tychicus,</hi> he calleth him his beloved Brother, and a faithful Miniſter, and Fellow-ſervant in the LORD; titles, as you ſee very honourable. He qualifies him after the ſame manner, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> to whom he employ'd him in the very ſame ſort as he doth here to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> Whence it appears, that this holy man was one of thoſe extraordinary Miniſters, which the Scripture of the New Teſtament do's particularly ſtile Evangeliſts. Theſe were as aids to the Apoſtles; aſſiſted them, followed them, and were diverſly employed by them according to the neceſſities of the Church, ſometime in one place, ſometime in another, without being fixed to any particular flock, as ordinary Paſtors are, and making no longer ſtay any where, then the Apoſtles orders did require. Such a one, for inſtance, was <hi>Titus,</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> left in <hi>Crete</hi> to finiſ the erection of the Church,
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.5.</note> and afterward ſent into <hi>Dalmatia</hi> to preach the Goſpel there.
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.10.</note> Such a one again was <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi> and many others. And truly the charge the Apoſtles had, being of ſuch a vaſt extent, as to embrace the whole univerſe, it is evident, that it did of neceſſity require they ſhould be aſſiſted by ſuch Helpers and inferiour Miniſters, who might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſuch places, as they themſelves could not go to, or tarry in.</p>
                     <p>Our adverſaries, to give you this intimation by the way, do commit an errour in this matter, when they apply to Biſhops, what they read in the New Teſtament of this ſort of Miniſters. For it's true indeed, that the Evangeliſts were ſuperior unto
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50919:236"/>the common and ordinary Paſtors of each Church, and held the next place to the Apoſtles, whoſe Lieutenants in a manner they were. But it's falſe, that any ſuch Miniſters were, or were to be in the Church after the Apoſtles deceaſe. Their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry was extraordinary, and ſubſiſted no longer then the Apoſtleſhip did, for which properly it was inſtituted. And hence it plainly appears, that the Biſhops of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> communion can by no means paſs for Miniſters of this order; ſince they have each of them their Title or Dioceſs, to which they are faſtned, and have no power to exerciſe their Miniſtry elſewhere, whereas the Evangeliſts had no flock that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and particularly aſſigned them; but were as general intendants, who by the Apoſtles order, and according to the neceſſities of Churches, did tranſport themſelves, ſometime to one, and ſometime to another; unto countries and people very far aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; as you ſee by the example of <hi>Titus,</hi> who having been employ'd in ordering the Churches of <hi>Crete,</hi> when that was done, came back to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> whence he was, a long time after, ſent into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> a countrey (as all know) very far diſtant from the Iſle of <hi>Candie. Tychicus</hi> then was a Miniſter of this rank, abiding near St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s perſon, to receive and execute his orders, as you ſee, both by the paſſage in hand, which ſhews us, that he ſent him to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to edifie and comfort them;
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.10. Eph. 6.22.</note> and by the Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> themſelves, where we read, that he ſent him to <hi>Epheſus</hi> upon a like deſign; and by the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tit. 3.12.</note> whom he directs to diſpatch <hi>Tychicus.</hi> And it ſhould ſeem, he was conſecrated parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to this Miniſtry, when he was named among thoſe that were to accompany St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the voyage he made out of <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Aſia</hi> through <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 20.6.</note> about the fifty third year of our LORD, (that is, three, or four years before the date of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The praiſes which the Apoſtle here gives him, do's ſhew us, with what zeal, with what care and courage he acquitted himſelf in this ſacred miniſtration. For he calls him, firſt, his beloved brother; declaring thereby, both his Chriſtianity, (for the faithful, you know, did all call one another, brethren) and the particular affection he bore him, loving and tendring him, as an excellent perſon, and one endowed with very amiable parts. He ſtiles him, in the ſecond place, a faithful Miniſter. The latter of which words ſignifieth his office. He was not ſimply a Chriſtian; he was a Miniſter in the Houſe of GOD, that is, an Evangeliſt, as we have ſhewed you. The other expreſſeth his carriage, and good conſcience in the diſcharge of his office. For how holy and divine ſoever it be, it cannot avoid, the falling ſometimes into ill hands, and the adorning profane or negligent men, who do ill acquit themſelves in it, and diſhonour it by the foul blots of their life or their doctrine. The Apoſtle bears witneſs for <hi>Tychicus,</hi> that he is none of that unbleſt number, terming him not only a Miniſter, but a faithful Miniſter: a commendation, that compriſeth the whole perfection of a true Miniſter; according to that, which the ſame Apoſtle teacheth us elſewhere. Let a man ſo account of us (ſaith he) as Miniſters of CHRIST,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1, 2.</note> and tew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the Miſteries of GOD. Moreover it is required in ſtewards, that each of them be found faithful. He that is faithful, doth acquit himſelf in the Miniſtry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, truſtily according to the will and order of CHRIST, of whom he receiv'd it; which as you ſee, compriſeth all the parts and perfections thereof.</p>
                     <p>But here, as we proceed, it will not be impertinent to repel, with the Authority of this phraſe of the Apoſtles, as with a firm and fair buckler, an accuſation drawn up by thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> who reproach us, that we give Paſtors a new name, and ſuch a one as is unuſed in the language of the Church, while we commonly call them Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, a name, as they pretend, pertaining only to Deacons, who are Miniſters, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one knows, of an order inferiour to that of Paſtors. Dear Brethren, would to GOD that in the diſputes we have with thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> queſtion were but of words! It would be eaſie for us to accomodate our ſelves to their language; nor ſhould we make any ſcruple to call the Paſtors of the Church, as they do, by the names of Prieſts and Biſhops, which we confeſs all the Ancients, and even the holy Apoſtles have uſed in this ſenſe. It's the abuſe and corruption of things, which hath cauſed us to quit theſe words; and ſeeing that the common ſpeech of people had appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them unto new offices, and ſuch as were unknown to the Apoſtles, meaning by the word Prieſt, a Sacrificer; and by that of Biſhop, a Pontifor ſuperior of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50919:237"/>we have left theſe names to them, with the things they ſignifie among 'em, as things utterly contrary to the inſtitution of GOD: and that our Paſtors might not be confounded with theirs, as if we held them for Sacrificers, and Pontiffs; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the names of Prieſt and Biſhop, which the abuſe of publick ſpeech hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and ſwayed to this ſenſe, we have called them Miniſters, a name, as every one ſees, very modeſt, and moſt ſutable to their Office, which as to the whole of it, is nothing but a Miniſtery; and though, I acknowledg, that this word, in Greek the very word Deacon, is often uſed to ſignifie their order, who have care of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches poor; yet this paſſage of the Apoſtle plainly ſhews us, that it is not ſo peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly annexed to the Diaconat, but that it may be employed to ſignifie Paſtors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: For its preciſely the term he makes to ſerve him here, for the expreſſing of that quality of Paſtor, or Evangeliſt, which <hi>Tichycus</hi> had, when he affirms him to be a faithful Miniſter: not to alledg at preſent, that he uſeth the ſame word very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently otherwhere, to ſignifie not only the Office of Preachers, but the Apoſtleſhip it ſelf,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.5. 2 Cor. 3.6. &amp; 11.23.</note> the higheſt of all Eccleſiaſtick charges; as when he ſaith, <hi>Who then is</hi> Paul, <hi>and who is</hi> Apollos, <hi>but Miniſters by whom you believed:</hi> and elſewhere he ſtileth them, Miniſters of the New Teſtament, and Miniſters of CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>But I return to <hi>Tychicus,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle ſaith in the third place, that he is his fellow-ſervant in the LORD. Not, that he was an Apoſtle, as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf: but ſince himſelf in his Apoſtleſhip, and <hi>Tychicus</hi> in his miniſtery as an Evangeliſt, ſerved one and the ſame LORD, and were of the ſame Maſter's houſe, referring all the diſchargements of their, though different offices, to His glory, and the good of His houſhold, as their common end, and labouring, though with unequal authority, in the ſame work, to wit, preaching of the Goſpel, and adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, it is evident, that in this reſpect, <hi>Tychieus</hi> was fellow-ſervant with this great Apoſtle. His acknowledging him here ſo to be, was a direct means to gain him full credit with the <hi>Coloſſians:</hi> For if they did honour the Apoſtle, how could they deſpiſe a perſon whom he owneth for his beloved Brother, for a faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Goſpel, and his fellow-ſervant? Now by his thus honouring of <hi>Tychicus,</hi> you may ſee how far from this Apoſtolical meekneſſe and modeſty ſome are, who boaſting themſelves to be their ſucceſſors, do tread other Miniſters of the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feet, and ſo little think them their aſſociates, or treat them according to that quality, that they look on them as their vaſſals; giving out themſelves to be their Princes, their Kings, and Lords; and advancing themſelves at an almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite heighth, not only above each of them a-part, but even the whole aſſembly of them in a general Council: nay, above the whole ſacred body of JESUS CHRIST it ſelf; that is, entirely all the Church, which they affirm to be born their ſubject, and do entitle themſelves Monarchs of, not forbearing to put even greateſt Princes and Emperors under the yoke of their domination, and to exact of them, as a mark of loweſt ſervitude, the kiſſing of their feet.</p>
                     <p>But this holy and admirable humility of the Apoſtle appears further ſtill, in his ſpeaking, as he does of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> whom he ſent with <hi>Tychicus</hi> unto the <hi>Coloſſians. He is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>our faithful Brother,</hi> &amp;c. For who, think you, was this <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> to whom he does ſo much honour, as to call him his faithful, and beloved brother? Dear Brethren, it was a poor fugitive bond-ſervant, that is, a perſon of the meaneſt and moſt deſpicable condition of any at that time; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf gives us to underſtand, in the Epiſtle which he wrote in favour of this at-length-happy fugitive, unto <hi>Philemon</hi> the <hi>Coloſſian</hi> his Maſter; where he plainly intimates, that this poor man, ſtealing from his Maſter's houſe, had fled into <hi>Italy,</hi> and got to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> for ſafety. But oh the admirable providence of GOD, who knoweth how to carry on the ſalvation of His elect, by waies that we cannot comprehend! the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hapning to be priſoner there, and <hi>Oneſimus</hi> led by his curioſity, or ſome other ſuch occaſion, having heard him, was ſo affected at his preaching, as that of a Pagan, he became a Chriſtian; of a ſervant of <hi>Philemon,</hi> a free-man of JESUS CHRIST; and inſtead of that temporal impunity for the crime committed againſt his Maſter, which he fought at <hi>Rome,</hi> he there found the eternal remiſſion of his ſins, and the ſalvation of his ſoul. This is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere means, when he ſaith, that <hi>he begat him in his bonds.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 10.</note> Now the Apoſtle having ſhewed him the fault he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50919:237"/>had committed in deſerting his Maſter, he reſolves to return home to him, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily render up himſelf unto his yoke again. And that <hi>Philemon</hi> might pardon his offence, he makes him the bearer of a letter, which he writes him on this ſubject; a letter ſo full of all the expreſſeſt teſtimonies of a tender and ardent affection, which may be given, as does ſufficiently prove, he did in truth account him, as he here terms him, his beloved Brother.</p>
                     <p>But ſome of the ancient Writers of the Church do further intimate, that <hi>Oneſimus</hi> profited ſo well in the knowledge of GOD, and in piety, as notwithſtanding the meanneſs of his condition after the fleſh, he was advanced to the ſacred miniſtery of the Goſpel, and executed it in the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> And truly, the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Apoſtle gives him here, in reference to this whole Church, and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Tychicus,</hi> whom he aſſociates him with, and the honourable title he gives him, ſtiling him, not only his beloved brother (which every Chriſtian is capable of) but moreover faithful, ſeems to ſhew, that he had ſome office; upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whereof, for his conſcionable acquitting himſelf in it, this teſtimonial of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is given him. And herein, I conceive, the Apoſtle doth alſo make a ſecret oppoſition, between the good conſcience with which he demeaned himſelf in this employment, and the unfaithfulneſs he had afore-time ſhewed to his Maſter, during the time of his ignorance; if he hath been otherwhile unfaithful, ſaith he, he is now faithful; after well-nigh the ſame manner, as the Apoſtle elſewhere, alluding to the word <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> which was his name, and in Greek ſignifies profitable, ſays of him to <hi>Philemon</hi> his Maſter, <hi>He was in time paſt to thee unprofitable;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Philem. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>but now profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thee, and to me.</hi> This is that, Dear Brethren, which the firſt part of the Text doth contain.</p>
                     <p>Come we now to the ſecond; In it, the Apoſtle preſents to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations of three faithful perſons, all the three joyntly Miniſters of the Goſpel, and by nation Jews, who were then at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſerve, and aſſiſt, and refreſh him in his impriſonment; <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſaluteth you, and ſo the reſt in order.</hi> Whence we may obſerve, firſt in general, what was the zeal, and what the charity of thoſe primitive Chriſtians; that the hatred and rage of the World was not able to keep them from rendring their devoirs and ſervices to the Confeſſors and Martyrs of JESUS CHRIST, even in Priſons; nor from haſtning to them out of places ever ſo far off, to ſuccour and comfort them: it being evident, that of the eight perſons men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here, and in the following Text, ſome came from <hi>Greece,</hi> others from <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſome again from <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> that is, many hundred leagues, to viſit and ſerve St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And by theſe Salutations, which for their part they ſend the <hi>Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> you ſee how theſe holy and charitable ſouls were affectionate to flocks, as well as Paſtors, and thoſe that were abſent, as well as them that were preſent. In fine, the Apoſtles vouchſafing to be as their Secretary on ſuch an occaſion, ſhews us, that he approves theſe offices of civility, that is, ſalutations of ſuch as are preſent, and by Letter, of ſuch as are abſent. In truth, a Chriſtian, whoſe Charity, and unfeigned cordial love of men, is the principal vertue, and as it were the ſoul, and one of the prime principles of his life, ought to acquit himſelf ſedulouſly in all due offices of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; and if there be, in the deportments of other men, any thing humane, and praiſe-worthy, he ſhould practice it, and ſanctifie it to his LORDS uſe.</p>
                     <p>As for theſe three perſons in particular, the Apoſtle gives each of them his Elogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. The firſt is <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> a native of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 19.20. &amp; 27.19, 20, 27.</note> a perſon noted in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where you ſee him all along inſeparably faſtened to S. <hi>Paul;</hi> a companion in his travels and in his tryals, running the danger of his life with him, in the ſedition at <hi>Epheſus:</hi> at his departure thence, following him into <hi>Greece,</hi> into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Judea;</hi> and at laſt, embarking with him, when he was carried Priſoner to <hi>Rome.</hi> For this cauſe the holy Apoſtle, in acknowledgment of ſo admirable a zeal, makes him a ſharer with him in his Crown, terming him a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or Priſoner with him: inaſmuch as though thoſe unjuſt Judges had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, yet he took as great a part in the Captivity of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as if ſentence had been given againſt his own perſon.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is <hi>Mark,</hi> whom he ſignalizeth by the honour he had to be <hi>Barnabas</hi> his couſin german, one of the moſt excellent Diſciples of our LORD, and that laboured
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50919:238"/>in his work with greateſt zeal and fervour, as you ſee in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and ſome of the Ancients have even attributed to him the divine Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The glory of this holy man being very great in all the Church of GOD, the Apoſtle conceiv'd it a ſufficient recommendation of <hi>Mark,</hi> to ſay he was his Siſters Son. He addeth only, concerning whom you have received order. I am much of their mind, who underſtand theſe words, of ſome letter that <hi>Barnabas</hi> had wrote them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of him. And thereunto the Apoſtle adjoyns his own counſel to them,
<note place="margin">Acts 15.39.</note> ſaying, <hi>if he come unto you, receive him.</hi> Some conceive that he thus writes, becauſe of that ill underſtanding that ſometime hapned between him and <hi>Barnabas</hi> on the occaſion of <hi>Mark;</hi> to ſhew now, that there was no relique of it in his heart. However that be, 'tis certain, as we read in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that <hi>Mark</hi> bewray'd a little weakneſs at the beginning,
<note place="margin">Acts 13.13.</note> quitting <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> in <hi>Pamphilia</hi> without any reaſon, amid their conqueſts. But afterward, the Grace of GOD ſo mightily ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened him: and ſo eminently employed him in converting of Nations, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the memory of it, which remains in all the monuments of antiquity; he hath alſo drawn from the pen of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> two or three very honourable teſtimonies; this here for one,
<note place="margin">Phil. 24.</note> and another like it, in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> where he mentions him among his fellow-workers; and the moſt advantageous of all in the ſecond to <hi>Timothy;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.11.</note> 
                        <hi>Take</hi> Mark (ſaith he) <hi>and bring him with thee, for he is profitable to me for the Miniſtry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third of thoſe, whom the Apoſtle mentions here, is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> called <hi>Juſtus.</hi> 'Tis probable, that his true name was <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and that <hi>Juſtus</hi> was but the name which the Latines and Greeks gave him, calling him <hi>Juſtus</hi> inſtead of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> it being uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with them to alter foreign names in that manner, when they pronounc'd them in their own dialects. We have, of this ſervant of GOD, no other memorial at all. For though ſome conceive that it's the ſame <hi>Juſtus,</hi> of whom ſpeech is in the 18th. Chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> unto whoſe houſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> retir'd at <hi>Corinth,</hi> when he ſaw the Jews reſiſt his preaching; yet this ſeems not poſſible, becauſe this man was by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction a Gentile, and uncircumciſed, though he had ſome knowledge, and fear of GOD, as appears by St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s terming him a religious man, or one that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped GOD; a character he ordinarily gives to perſons of this condition; as to <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, and divers others; whereas that <hi>Juſtus,</hi> who is in queſtion here, was indeed a Jew, and circumciſed, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, adding immediately, of him, and the two other afore-named, who are of the circumciſion; and he praiſeth them all three in commune, ſaying, that they alone, (to wit, of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) were his fellow-workers unto the kingdom of GOD, and proteſteth, that they were a conſolation to him. A great and an illuſtrious teſtimonial given them; that they laboured with him in preaching the Goſpel, for the advancement of the kingdom of GOD, that is to ſay, for the edifying of the Church, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ordinarily calls the kingdom of Heaven, and in the ſame ſenſe, the kingdom of GOD. Now this is that that the Apoſtle ſays of theſe three ſervants of the LORD.</p>
                     <p>It remains for a concluſion, that we intimate unto you briefly, what edification you ought to draw from thoſe particulars which we have noted in the Apoſtles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Text. And firſt, by the pain the <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſſians</hi> were in for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and by the care St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes for their conſolation, you may ſee the ardent and cordial affection which the flocks, and Miniſters of CHRIST ſhould have for one another. Make your profit of it, ye the LORD's ſheep, and tenderly compaſſionate the labours, and the ſufferings of your Paſtors. Ye Paſtors do likewiſe, and prefer before all intereſts of your own, the edification, and conſolation of thoſe ſheep whom the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard hath redeemed with his blood. Then again, the love which theſe five faithful men here mentioned did bear unto St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they keeping ever neer him, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and conſtantly obeying his orders, ſhews us, with what fervour we ſhould ſerve ſuch as ſuffer for the Goſpel: and with what zeal we ſhould inſeparably adhere to the Apoſtles of JESUS CHRIST, the Teachers, and Founders of the Church. For though their perſons be no longer here below, yet their doctrine is, and will remain here to the end; and in this reſpect they are ſtill in their ſacred writings, ſitting as it were on twelve thrones, thence judging all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD.</p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:50919:238"/>
                     <p>Moreover, the Apoſtle's praiſing all the perſons, he here ſpeaks of, ſo liberally as he doth, may inform us with what candor we ſhould acknowledge the graces, which GOD hath imparted to our brethren; diffuſing the ſweet ſavour of their good name through the Church, and honouring their zeal, and their fidelity with our te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonials, to their comfort, and the edification of their neighbours. Far from us be envy, and malignity, and pride, paſſions of a baſe alloy, and unworthy of a truly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chriſtian diſpoſition. Let not the graces and dignity of <hi>Paul</hi> induce him to deſpiſe <hi>Oneſimus;</hi> I mean, let not the advantages of ſuch as are greateſt, cauſe them to diſdain the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>But conſider we particularly the examples of each of thoſe five faithful men, and imitate them. For it's to this end that the holy Apoſtle hath propoſed them, and thought meet to conſecrate the memory of them in his divine and immortal Epiſtles: not that he might oblige us to dedicate feſtivals to them, or render them religious worſhip, or invocate them as our Mediators; away with ſuch a thought; (for all this appertaineth to GOD only.) The true honour we owe them, is to ſerve GOD after their example; and conform our lives to theirs, and draw the pourtraict of their high and holy vertues, on our diſpoſitions and our actions. Imitate we the fidelity of <hi>Tychicus;</hi> the repentance and faith of <hi>Oneſimus;</hi> the courage and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of <hi>Ariſtarchus;</hi> the laboriouſneſs of <hi>Marcus,</hi> and of <hi>Juſtus</hi> in the matters of the Kingdom of GOD. Let not meanneſs of birth, or of condition; let not the greatneſs of ſins diſcourage any. JESUS CHRIST rejecteth neither the poor, nor the peccant that come to him with faith; witneſs <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> who though a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and fugitive, yet ſo effaced all this ignominy, that he hath praiſe from the mouth of the Apoſtle, and his name engraven here in the temple of GOD, among the names of the moſt illuſtrious Servants of His. If you have followed the LORD conſtantly and evenly, as <hi>Tychicus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> did, thank Him for the grace He hath ſhewed you, and go on from good to better. If it hath befaln you, as it did <hi>Mark,</hi> to ſlacken ſometime in the work of your heavenly calling, reſume likewiſe, as he did, your former vigour, and reduce your ſelves to that paſs, as it may be ſaid of you, that you are uſeful for the LORD's ſervice.</p>
                     <p>In general, Beloved Brethren, let us all be as theſe holy and happy perſons were, fellow-workers with the great Apoſtle unto the Kingdom of GOD; burning with him in an holy zeal to glorifie JESUS CHRIST; living with him in all pureneſs and ſanctity; employing with him, our tongues, our hands, and our pens, for the converting of men, and edifying of the Church; and finally, couragiouſly ſuffering with him, when the LORD calleth us thereto. It's this way, Chriſtians, that we ſhall get to that heavenly Kingdom, in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> is lodg'd after his combats, and there receive with him from the merciful hand of our Father the glorious crown of immortality, which He on His great day, will give to us, and to all thoſe that ſhall have lov'd the appearing of His Son; unto Whom, with Him, and the Holy Spirit, the only true GOD bleſſed for ever, be honour, praiſe, and glory to ages of ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>

<note place="margin">Acts 4.32.</note> animated with the vertue of His heavenly fire. <hi>The whole multitude of them</hi> (ſaith the holy ſtory) <hi>was of one heart, and of one ſoul;</hi> neither ſaid any of them, that ought of the things which he poſſeſſed, was his own; but they had all things
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50919:239"/>common. This union, and admirable correſpondence continued a long time among the faithful; and was obſerved by the Pagans with wonder; witneſs he, who about two hundred years after the birth of our LORD, reproacheth Chriſtians, that they know one another by certain ſecret ſigns; and love, almoſt before they are acquainted, and all of them call one another indifferently, brethren, and ſiſters. Now, as error and paſſion do abuſe the beſt things, this poor ignorant takes their holy and divine concord for ſome execrable conſpiracy; and referrs the myſterie of their amity unto infamous commerces; whereas all their union grew from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and was founded upon piety; and breathed nothing but honeſty, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nor did tend but to the glory of GOD, and the ſupreme happineſs of men. Beſide the Apoſtles writings, which expos'd in publick view, did plainly diſcover to the unpaſſionate, how pure, and honeſt, and holy, the laws of their charity were; the manners, and the lives, and actions of thoſe primitive Chriſtians, did alſo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifie the ſame. There are left us, GOD be thanked, divers excellent infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations in the books of the firſt antiquity, by which the marvels of the charity, and mutual love of thoſe holy men do plainly appear. And not to ſpeak of others, you have fair and illuſtrious marks of it, in this concluſion of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle unto the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> who ſheweth us, that his priſon neither hindred divers faithful men from joyning themſelves unto him in this affliction, nor him, nor them again from mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent Chriſtians, and charitably embracing the Churches of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> and <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi> and <hi>Hierapolis.</hi> You here ſee the love of Paſtors to their flocks; the dear affection of flocks to their Paſtors; and the divine communication of Churches one with another.

                     <p>You have already heard how St. <hi>Paul,</hi> having advertiſed the faithful at <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> that he ſent <hi>Tychicus,</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus</hi> unto them, to inform them of his eſtate, doth give them the recommendations of <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He now addeth thoſe of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Demas;</hi> and then his own to the Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> and to a faithful man named <hi>Nymphas;</hi> with an order to impart this his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to them, and to advertiſe <hi>Archippus</hi> of his duty: Whereupon he endeth with his ordinary ſalutation, conjuring them to remember his bonds, and recommending them to the grace of GOD. For the deducing of theſe four points, by the aſſiſtance of GOD, in the ſame order, as they are couched in the Text, we muſt firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider who theſe three perſons were, whoſe ſalutations the Apoſtle preſents to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> The firſt of the three is <hi>Epaphras;</hi> of whom he ſpake afore in very honourable terms, at the beginning of this Epiſtle; where he ſtileth him,
<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.7, 8.</note> his <hi>dear fellow ſervant, and a faithful Miniſter of CHRIST,</hi> and gives him the glory of having inſtructed the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> in the knowledge of the Goſpel, and of having taken the care to let him know the charity they had for him. Here he qualifies him in like manner, a fervant of CHRIST; that is, a Miniſter of his, and an Officer of His houſe in the work of the Goſpel. Moreover, he informs us, that this holy man was a <hi>Coloſſian;</hi> that is, was born in their City, or at leaſt made his ordinary abode there; <hi>Epaphras</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who is one of you, a ſervant of CHRIST, ſaluteth you.</hi> Some learned men
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Grotius.</hi> Phil. 2.28.</note> are of opinion, that it's this ſame Paſtor whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and of whom he ſays ſo much good, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> But I do not ſee, that this conjecture is either founded, or followed by any of the ancients. I confeſs, that the name <hi>Epaphras,</hi> is a contraction of <hi>Epaphroditus:</hi> and ſuch a diminution is ordinary in the Greek, and in the Latin tongue, in the proper names of men. But if it were one and the ſame perſon; there is no reaſon why the Apoſtle ſhould name him diverſly in theſe two Epiſtles, in the one contracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with diminution; in the other the name at length, and entire. Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withal, that no part of what is ſaid in thoſe two places concerning him, doth oblige us to believe it was the ſame man; but rather inferrs the contrary. For it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50919:240"/>ſeems, that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was Paſtor of the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> in <hi>Macedonia;</hi> whereas <hi>Epaphras,</hi> of whom queſtion is here, was Paſtor of <hi>Coloſs</hi> in <hi>Phrygia;</hi> two Cities and Provinces very different, and diſtanced from one another by much Land and Sea; the ſecond ſituate in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the former in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle contenteth not himſelf with telling the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> that <hi>Epaphras</hi> ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them. Unto this teſtimony of his affection for them, he addeth divers others, that he may gain him their hearts, and ſtreiten the tye of amity, and good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence more and more between this Paſtor, and his Flock. He ſaith firſt, that he alway ſtriveth in prayer for them, <hi>that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye might abide perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in all the will of GOD.</hi> Prayer is the beſt office that we can perform to thoſe we love. But Paſtors particularly owe it to their Flocks, not only in their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, where they ſerve for the mouth of the company to preſent their requeſts, their vows, and their thanksgivings unto GOD: but alſo in private, and even then, when they are abſent upon ſome occaſion of importance for the good of the Church; as doubtleſs that was, which at that time held <hi>Epaphras</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> by St <hi>Paul</hi>'s order. Though he was far from their abode, he had them inceſſantly in mind; and eloignment hindring him from rendring them his other devoirs, he aſſiſted them with his prayers. The Apoſtle ſignifieth, both the aſſiduity of them, when he ſaith, <hi>he prayed alway;</hi> and the fervency and earneſtneſs of them, when he ſaith, <hi>he ſtrove or fought for them.</hi> This word is admirable, and excellently repreſents the efficacy of his prayer. Think not, Chriſtian, that he that prays for you contributes nothing to your welfare, and that his prayers are but words, and voices caſt into the air. It's the beſt part of your battles; you have no ſuccour more active, then the repoſe of a man of GOD, who prays for you with faith and perſeverance. It's he, that as <hi>Moſes</hi> heretofore, ſtanding on the mountain, and rapt up in ſpirit into the heavenly ſanctury, defeated <hi>Amalek,</hi> your ſpiritual enemies; and by the uplifting of his hands, draws down the bleſſing of Heaven upon your arms. He oftentimes even takes thoſe rods out of the hand of GOD, which He is about to diſplay upon you; and couragiouſly wreſtling with Him, after <hi>Jacob</hi>'s example, quits Him not until he hath obtained his demand. Such is the combat, that <hi>Epaphras</hi> ſought in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> being night and day in prayer for them.</p>
                     <p>But what is it, that he demanded of GOD for them? The Apoſtle ſhewsit us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, when he ſaith, he ſtrove for them in prayer, that they might abide perfect, and compleat in all the will of GOD. He deſired not for them the riches, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and contentments of the world, he uſual paſſion of men; ſleight and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goods: unprofitable, and oft-times even pernicious to thoſe who poſſeſs them. He prayed GOD to give them the beſt bleſſings: perſeverance in His love, and in His fear, and in the obeying of His will. For it is this, that the Apoſtle's words do ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie. He demanded, firſt, that they might be perfect and compleat in all the will of GOD; and ſecondly, that they might abide firm in this perfection. By the will of GOD, he meaneth thoſe things which GOD willeth, which He hath a liking to, and doth command us in the Goſpel of His Son; in the ſame manner, as he elſewhere ſaith, our hope, for the things we hope to obtain; and the promiſe of GOD for the things He hath promiſed us.
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.3.</note> He thus explains himſelf, when he ſaith expreſly in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that the will of God is our ſanctification; which as you ſee, is no other, but that the thing which GOD willeth, is, that we be holy. It's that will of GOD which elſewhere he calleth good, and acceptable, and perfect; which comprehendeth in it all the particulars of our duty; that is, in few words, faith and piety towards GOD, and charity towards our neighbour. For this is that which GOD willeth; that which He ordaineth and commandeth all men in the Goſpel of His CHRIST; even that we believe in Him, embracing with a pure, and thorough faith, the verities He hath vouchſafed to 1. veal unto us, and chiefly the promiſe of our ſalvation by the Croſs of our LORD JESUS; and that in ſequel we ſerve Him religiouſly, renouncing all impiety; and love our neighbours, living with them in all juſtice, temperance, and benignity. This, Brethren, is that will of GOD, which the Apoſtle doth intend; and obſerve, he ſaith not ſimply, in the will, but in all the will of GOD. For there are people, that would be content to do ſome part of what GOD willeth, provided they might be diſpens'd with for the reſt;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50919:240"/>as for example, to believe the truth which GOD hath revealed; but not do the good works. He hath commanded; or to exerciſe ſome of them, but utterly fail in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; as they, who live fair with men, but remain in impiety, and in the profeſſion of errour; or thoſe on the contrary, who make profeſſion of errour; or thoſe on the contrary, who make open profeſſion of the pure ſervice of GOD; but ſpare not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the goods or honour of their neighbours; or who abſteining from one vice, do licence themſelves unto others; are chaſt, but covetous; or liberal, and beneficial to the poor, but debauched, and incontinent. This partition is unjuſt, injurious unto GOD, impoſſible in truth, and incompatible with the nature of the things themſelves, And it's to advertiſe us hereof, that the Apoſtle ſaith here expreſly, in all the will of GOD; to the end no man might imagine it ſufficient to embrace a part only of what GOD willeth. <hi>Epaphras</hi> deſired therefore, that his <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might be perfect, and compleat in all this will of GOD; that is, (as we have now explained it) in all the things that GOD willeth; that He requireth of us, that He commandeth men to do; that they might be perfect in ſaith, perfect in piety, perfect in charity, and in all vertue and ſanctity.</p>
                     <p>The two words, he expreſſeth himſelf by, to wit, perfect and compleat, do ſignifie well nigh one and the ſame thing; and the Scripture uſeth them indifferently, to ſet ſorth a being entire, &amp; in one whom none of the parts of piety and ſanctification are wanting, Now this perfection, or integrity in all the will of GOD, doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend two things: the one is, that we know it, that we underſtand exactly all that GOD willeth, all that He requireth of us, as He hath reveal'd it in His word. The other is, that we purſue, and effectively practiſe this will of His, which we do know. The firſt of theſe two points, the Apoſtle recommends to us elſewhere;
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.17.</note> Be ye not unwiſe (ſaith he,) but underſtanding what the will of the LORD is; and elſewhere again he commandeth us to prove it. The neceſſity of the other point,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.2.</note> our LORD JESUS CHRIST ſheweth us, when He ſaith in the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Not every one that ſaith unto me, LORD, LORD, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; but he that doth the will of my Father, which is in Heaven.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 7.21.</note> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that while the beleever is here below, there want many degrees, both in his knowledge of the will of GOD, and in the obedience he renders Him, of that ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and ſupreme perfection, which he ſhall one day attain unto in Heaven,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12.</note> according to the Apoſtle's aſſertion, in 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, that now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, and know but in part: but then we ſhall ſee face to face, and know as we are known.</hi> Yet this hinders not, but that ſetting this compariſon aſide, that meaſure of faith and holineſs, which the faithful do at preſent attain unto, may be termed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and compleatneſs; becauſe it is without hypocriſie, reaching to internals, and externals, and doth include all the parts of true piety and chaſtity, not one left out. And it's in this ſenſe, that the truly faithful are oft-times in Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led perfect and compleat; to wit, in reference to the ſtate, and meaſure of the preſent life, for a diſtinguiſhing of them, not only from prophane and brutiſh men, who take up no part of the will of GOD at all; but alſo from hypocrites and carnal Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who conſider but a part thereof, halting between two, and are throughly and abſolutely neither in CHRIST, nor of the world. <hi>Epaphras</hi> had reaſon to deſire this perfection for his <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> ſince that no one without it can inherit everlaſting life. And they, who dogmatize, that it is not univerſally neceſſary for the obtaining of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that it is a matter of counſel, (as they call it) not of command; they I ſay, are grievouſly miſtaken, and do, by this pernicious errour, open a door of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence unto wicked men, and furniſh them with pillows to ſleep upon in mortal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p>For our parts, dear Brethren, follow we the prayer of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> and take good heed, we never count that thing ſuperfluous, or unneceſſary, which he ſo inſtantly beg'd of GOD for his flock and ſheep. And knowing, that they ſhall have no part in Heaven, whoſe righteouſneſs doth not exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees; and that JESUS CHRIST will receive in thither none but them that have done the will of GOD His Father; let us apply our ſelves with all our might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o know it, and fulfil it. Let us give our ſelves no reſt, untill by prayers and tears, and by continual labour and exerciſe in the Goſpel, we have attained
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50919:241"/>to be perfect, and compleat in all the will of GOD. Yet it is not enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hereto; we muſt abide and ſtand firm in it, as the Apoſtle here ſays; perſevere conſtantly to our laſt breath, in this brave and bleſſed undertaking; neither the menaces, nor the careſſes of the world; neither the Sophiſms of ſeducers, nor the ſcandals of falſe brethren, nor the weakneſſes of our own fleſh, ever prevailing over us to make us vary. For you know, that the crown of ſalvation is for them alone that perſevere. It's thus, that <hi>Epaphras</hi> ſtrove to obtain of GOD by his ardent, and aſſiduous prayers, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might abide perfect, and compleat in all the will of GOD.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Apoſtle knew how much it concerned this people, to be firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the affection of their Paſtor; that he might aſſure them fully of it, he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them the authority of his own teſtimony <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>I bear him witneſs, that he hath a great zeal,</hi> (that is, a very ardent affection) <hi>for you and for them of</hi> Laodicea, <hi>and of</hi> Hierapolis. Theſe were two Cities of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> neighbouring on <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> where the LORD JESUS had Churches that ſerved Him in the faith of His Goſpel. And that of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is one of the ſeven, to whom He cauſed to be written by St. <hi>John,</hi> thoſe excellent Epiſtles, which are read in the firſt Chapters of his <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> You ſee what care the Apoſtle takes to ſet <hi>Epaphras</hi> right, in the Spirit of his flock. Whence you may judge, how execrable is the rage or envy of thoſe, who quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this holy man, do, by their detractions and ill offices, endeavour to alienate or ſlacken the inclination of Churches towards their Paſtors, and in ſo doing, render their miniſtry unprofitable to them. But, to proceed.</p>
                     <p>After the ſalutation of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> the Apoſtle preſents them that of <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Demas. Luke the beloved Phyſitian ſaluteth you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and alſo Demas.</hi> It's the conſtant opinion from all antiquity, that the firſt of theſe two is the ſame St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that wrote the third of our Goſpels, and the Book of the Acts of the Apoſtles; two of the moſt excellent pieces that we have in the Divine writings of the New Teſtament. And verily, beſides the name of <hi>Luke,</hi> his own hiſtory, as ſeems to me, leads us to it. For himſelf relateth, that he embarqued with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was carried priſoner into <hi>Italy;</hi> and that he came with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> as you may ſee in the two laſt Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where he deſcribes this voyage. Therefore being there with the Apoſtle, there is all the probability in the World, that he's the perſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in this place; it being not found, that mention is made in Scripture of any other faithful man of that name. He calls him Phyſician, becauſe of his former profeſſion; as you ſee, that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> is ſometimes termed a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, becauſe he e'rwhile was ſo, before his converſion. But that ſame heavenly call, that had changed <hi>Matthew</hi> from a Publican into an Apoſtle; and afore-time, of a keeper of ſheep, made <hi>David</hi> a Paſtor of Nations, wrought a like miracle in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and of a Phyſician to the body, made him a Phyſician of ſouls. His two books ſhew us, how able he was in this Divine art; and as often as you read them at home, or hear them publickly here, where, becauſe of their excellency, they are both of them explained to you, make account, that they are a quantity of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome medicines preſented you, to be applied to your ſouls, as you have need. I well know, that there are ſome modern Expoſitors, who referr what the Apoſtle ſaith here unto another <hi>Luke;</hi> but they produce no valuable reaſon: For whereas they alledge, that the Apoſtle would have adorned this perſon with ſome more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Elogie, if he had ſpoken of <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangeliſt, this is extremely feeble. Is it not a very glorious qualifying of him, to call him his well-beloved? It's a great honour to have the love of ſo holy an Apoſtle, and an aſſured teſtimony of piety and vertue. Withal, it is not alwaies neceſſary to accompany the names of illuſtrious perſons, with all the Elogies they merit. Surely the Apoſtle, in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> naming <hi>Timothy,</hi> whoſe praiſe, and great advantages in the work of the miniſtry, and in all vertue, every one ſufficiently knows, calls him ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, his brother <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other, on whoſe behalf he ſalutes the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> is <hi>Demas.</hi> In the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> written at the ſame time with this, and in which he maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or moſt of the perſons here named; he placeth <hi>Demas,</hi> with <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarchus,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> among his fellow-labourers; whence it appears, that he was
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50919:241"/>a Miniſter of the word of GOD; of the order of thoſe who ſerved for helpers to the Apoſtles, and are ſtiled Evangeliſts. But after he had for a ſpace ran well; after he had appeared with praiſe among the lights of the Church; alas! he loſt in the end this fair crown of glory. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who vouchſafed to give his name ſuch an honourable rank in two places of his Epiſtles, in a third, tells this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtory. <hi>Demas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath forſaken me, having lov'd this preſent world,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.10.</note> 
                        <hi>and is departed unto</hi> Theſſalonica. From this doleful example, let us all learn, Dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and particularly, ſuch of us, as GOD hath called to the holy Miniſtry, to ſtand on our guard, and to mortifie in our ſelves worldly luſts, as avarice, the love of life, and pleaſures, ambition, and ſuch like paſſions, which ruined <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi> And if the Dragon caſt down ſome of the ſtars, that ſhined in the heaven of our Churches; if the fleſh, and the earth, the food, and the fulneſs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the falſe grandeurs of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> cauſe them unworthily to quit the deſign, and the hopes of myſtical <hi>Canaan,</hi> let us not be ſcandalized at it. We are not better then the Apoſtles. If all the light of their wiſdom and miracles, could not keep <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> from becoming bankrupt of the truth, we ought not to think it ſtrange, if there happen to be among us, ſome whom belly and vanity do precipitate into the like fault, notwithſtanding the clearneſs and evidence of our holy doctrine.</p>
                     <p>But it is time to paſs into the ſecond part of our Text; in which the Apoſtle or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> three things; firſt, to ſalute thoſe of <hi>Laodicea</hi> on his behalf; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to communicate this Epiſtle of his to them; and thirdly, to advertiſe <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chippus</hi> of his duty. <hi>Salute</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the brethren,</hi> that is, the Chriſtians, <hi>which are at</hi> Laodicea; <hi>and</hi> Nymphas, <hi>and the Church which is in his houſe.</hi> This <hi>Nymphas</hi> dwelt either in the City of <hi>Laodicea</hi> it ſelf, or in the Countrey near it, as ſome, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do without neceſſity ſuſpect. The Apoſtle names him in particular, becauſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was one of the moſt conſiderable perſons of the flock at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s affirming, that he had a Church in his houſe, doth ſufficiently teſtifie the zeal of his piety. This Church was not a place in his houſe, where the Aſſemblies for religious exerciſes were, (for the Scripture never uſeth the word Church in this ſenſe, which is now common among Chriſtians) but it is his houſhold, and the perſons whereof it conſiſted, who all made profeſſion of Chriſtianity with him, and were confirmed, and edified therein by his inſtructions and good examples. Whence appears the vanity of the pretenſion of thoſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> who acknowledge no Church to be, but which braves it in the world, and carries with it the pomp of multitude and proſperity. The Church of JESUS CHRIST is found, where ever He is known and ſerved, and adored according to His Goſpel; within the encloſure of the walls of an houſe; in the very caverns of mountains, and coverts of the wilderneſs, whither the Holy Spirit expreſly foretelleth us, that the Spouſe of the Lamb ſhall be ſometimes conſtrained to retire.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond order, which the Apoſtle gives the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> is conſiderable. <hi>When this Epiſtle</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath been read among you, cauſe that it be alſo read in the Church of the</hi> Laodiceans; <hi>and read ye alſo the Epiſtle from</hi> Laodicea. Firſt, his willing, that this Epiſtle of his be publickly read in the aſſemblies of theſe two Churches, doth ſhew us, that the Scriptures of GOD were given us, to the end, all the people of CHRIST, Clerks and Laicks, ſmall and great, ſhould hear and read them, and not to be put into the hands of one certain ſort of perſons only, as if this treaſure did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to none but them. And hence appears the abuſe of thoſe, who read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to their people, but in a language they underſtand not; which is as bad, yea, in my opinion worſe, then if they read them not at all. For not to read them, is ſimply to bereave the people of the profit they might make of them; whereas to read them in an unknown tongue, is not only to deprive them of their edification; but moreover to mock them, and no leſs offend GOD by perverting His word in ſuch a manner from its due t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e and end. What ſhall I ſay of their outrage, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe theſe Divine books of ambiguity, of obſcurity, of ſeeming contradictions and errours? Who ſay, that the reading of them is dangerous, and more apt to corrupt, and embroil the faithful, then to inſtruct or edifie them. O holy Apoſtle, why didſt thou put ſo dangerous a book into our hands? a book full of thorns, and void of fruit? Why didſt thou order them to read it in their aſſembly; to impart it unto neighbouring Churches, and enjoyn them to read it alſo? Why didſt thou not fear
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50919:242"/>the infecting the Spirits of thine innocent Diſciples? and the inſnaring of them in ſome hereſie by the darkneſs of thy riddles? or the ſowing of ſome diſorder in their hearts, by the ambiguity of thine expreſſions? Dear Brethren, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle anſwers, that his Goſpel is clear; that it is not covered but to unſtable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſuch as are engaged in ſome evil paſſion; that this Epiſtle is not any ſeed of errour, but a remedy againſt ſeduction; a veſſel, full, not of poyſons, but of preſervatives and antidotes. But I perceive what the matter is. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſeem to theſe Gentlemen, dangerous; becauſe ſaying nothing of their Pope, nor of their Maſs, nor of the worſhip of their Saints, and Images, nor of their Purgatory, and ſuch other points; nay ſaying many things which are evidently contrary unto them, they eaſily induce thoſe that read them with reſpect, to beleeve, that theſe doctrines have been invented by men, and were never taught by JESUS CHRIST and His Apoſtles. This book troubles them, becauſe they find not their reckoning in it; it is obſcure; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what they love, do's not there appear. It is ambiguous; becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth nothing clearly or expreſly for the opinions, which they are reſolved never to forſake.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, this imparting of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle unto the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> unto which the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were obliged by his order, ſhews us, that there ought to be an holy and charitable commerce between the Churches of JESUS CHRIST, in reference to ſpiritual things. That a Church, which hath received any grace from GOD which tendeth to edification, ſhould not envy it to others, but affectionately communicate unto them all that may ſerve for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And this communion ought to have place particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween neighbouring Churches, as thoſe of <hi>Coloſs</hi> and of <hi>Laodicea</hi> were. And it's upon this example, and upon the reaſon on which it depends, that the uniting of the Churches of the ſame Provinces, and reſorts in the ſame Claſſes and Synods is founded; a thing inſtituted and obſerved from the beginning of Chriſtianity down to our days; and ſtill very profitably practiſed, and kept up among us, by the goodneſs of GOD.</p>
                     <p>This mutual communication of neighbouring Churches appears yet further, in that the Apoſtle orders the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> in the third place, to read alſo the letter from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> after their imparting to them his. <hi>When this Epiſtle</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath been read among you, cauſe, that it be alſo read in the Church of the</hi> Laodiceans; <hi>and read ye alſo that</hi> [which came, or was written] <hi>from</hi> Laodicea. It is demanded, what this ſecond Epiſtle, whereof he ſpeaks, ſhould be. Many Theologues of the communion of <hi>Rome,</hi> do anſwer; that it was a letter which St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the faithful of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> at the ſame time he wrote this to the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> whence they conclude, that this piece being loſt, as well as divers other writings of Prophets and Apoſtles, it cannot be pretended, that the Canon of holy Writ is perfect, and doth contain all things neceſſary unto our ſalvation. Others again from thence infer, that it is the Church, which gives the Scriptures the authority they have among Chriſtians; ſince of the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it hath left this in particular out of the Canon of Divine Books, and retained only thoſe fourteen, which are in our hands. But there is nothing found, nor ſolid in their arguing; which concludes ill, and preſuppoſeth what is falſe. For ſuppoſe, the Apoſtle had written an Epiſtle to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and that it were loſt, (as I would not avouch, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his fellow-bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Apoſtles, never wrote any thing to any particular perſon, or to any Church, but what is arrived down to us) ſuppoſe it, I ſay; who told them, that this loſs makes the Canon of our Scriptures defective? Who told them that there was in that letter ſome Article of Faith neceſſary unto our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is not found in the other parts of the Bible, we now have? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, who taught them thence to conclude, that it is the Church, who autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizeth the Divine Books? I grant, ſhe is the keeper and depoſitary of them; as the Synagogue ſometime was of the Books of the Old Teſtament, according to the Apoſtle's ſaying <hi>that unto them were committed the Oracles of GOD;</hi> and that it belongs to her charge to preſerve them, and read them, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50919:242"/>them to every one. But that it is the authority of her voice and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, which gives them the price and value they have, either in themſelves or in reference to faithful ſouls; this, in my opinion, cannot be ſaid without outraging the Majeſty of their Author; by making the divinity of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of His wiſdom, to depend upon the phantaſie of men. As the <hi>Romans</hi> heretofore ſubmitted the worſhip and divinity of their Gods, unto the Decrees of their Senate. They were not Gods, except it ſo pleaſed men. If it were certain, that the Apoſtle had written an Epiſtle to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and put it in the hands of the Church; it ſhould be concluded, not that ſhe hath the power to authorize what Divine Books ſhe pleaſeth; but rather that ſhe hath hugely failed of her duty, in having ſo ill kept an heavenly jewel. But the worſt yet is, that all they talk about this pretended Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> is a vain conceit, and hath no other foundation, but their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I well know that in our Fathers days,
<note n="*" place="margin">Faber. Stapulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</note> a Learned man did publiſh one under that name, having found it in three or four Libraries. But the piece is ſo groſs, and ſo ridiculous, that it hath been rejected equally on all hands; as the work of an impoſtour, who abuſing his leiſure, forged this trifle, and ſhameleſly fathered it upon St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Some of the Ancients do alſo make mention of a Script, bearing the ſame name; whether it were different from this, or did reſemble it. But the Ancients, that ſpeak of it do all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly decry it, as an Apocryphal Book, and iſſued out of an heretical Shop, and framed at pleaſure after St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s death.

<note n="*" place="margin">Gretius.</note> a certain Writer occaſion to fancy that St. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed ſent, and addreſſed the ſame Epiſtle to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> which at the ſame time he wrote to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> theſe two Churches having had need of the ſame remedies; and that its this Epiſtle the Apoſtle means in this place, willing the <hi>Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to take a copy of it, and read it in their Aſſembly. All this would paſs, if it were at all grounded; but it is too much conſidence, or credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to think to perſwade it us, upon the credit of <hi>Marcion;</hi> the moſt impudent impoſtor, that ever troubled the Church, and one that in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, played with the Books of the New Teſtament, contracting them, maiming them, and changing themat his pleaſure with an infernal licenſe. Beſides, this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition accordeth not with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words. For he doth not all ſay, as theſe perſons pretend, that the Epiſtle in queſtion, was written to the <hi>Laodiceans.</hi> True it is, the Latine Interpreter, hath rendred it the Epiſtle of the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceans:</hi> but this would ſignifie, as every one ſeeth, that the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> had wrote it; and not that they had receiv'd it, either from the Apoſtle, or from any other. Yet though the Latine would ſuffer this rude gloſs; it is clear, the original cannot be made to bear it, without undertaking (as theſe new Doctours do, truly with preſumption enough) to change the words of it, which we find uniform in the Greek Copies, and which the Ancients ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved there, above twelve hundred years ago. For they clearly import, as our Bibles have faithfully tranſlated, and repreſented, that this Epiſtle had been written or ſent from <hi>Laodicea;</hi> ſo that we muſt neceſſarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand them, with the ancient Greek Fathers, of an Epiſtle written, not to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> but from their City.</p>
                     <p>Now the Apoſtle telling us no more of it, either here, or elſewhere; we need not wonder, that ſuch as have had the curioſity to enquire, what this letter might be, have faln upon different opinions, as in a matter both obſcure, and beſides of no great neceſſity. Some of the Ancients ſay, that it is the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> written from <hi>Laodicea;</hi> as is expreſly reported by an old tradition, which is read ſtill to this day at the end of that Epiſtle,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50919:243"/>And the truth is, it cannot be deny'd, but this Epiſtle containeth divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions fit to edifie the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> about the buſineſs of thoſe ſeducers, whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> here oppoſeth; they dogmatiſed a diſcrimination of dayes and meats; and this is there expreſly condemned. And whereas it is alledged againſt theſe Authors, that the Apoſtle had not been in the City of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> by means whereof he could not have thence written any letters, either to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> or any other; they perhaps would anſwer with an Ancient Author, <hi>Theodoret</hi> by name, that the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> aſſuring us St. <hi>Paul</hi> had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed <hi>Phrygia,</hi> it is not very probable, but that he paſs'd through <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the capital City of the Province. And whereas he ſaith in the 2. <hi>chap.</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians, that he hath a great conflict for them, and for thoſe at</hi> Laodicea, <hi>and for all ſuch as had not ſeen his preſence in the fleſh;</hi> this ſhews indeed, that the Apoſtle had care even of thoſe of the faithful, whom he had not ſeen; but not that they of <hi>Laidicea,</hi> or of <hi>Coloſs</hi> were of the number; and that the ſenſe of theſe words is, <hi>he was in pain not only for them, whom he had ſeen, and known; but even for the Chriſtians he never ſaw.</hi> Yet becauſe this expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may ſeem a little forced; it is better and more eaſie to ſtick to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion, follow'd by the greater part of Expoſitors both Ancient and Modern; even that the Epiſtle from <hi>Laedicea</hi> here mention'd by the Apoſtle, was a letter written by the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> which letter he deſireth the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> ſhould read in their Aſſembly, becauſe it contained things which he judged helpful to their edification; perhaps concerning the perſons, or the errours, or the procedures of thoſe very ſeducers, whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth in this Epiſtle. This, in my opinion, is that which may be ſaid in the matter with greateſt probability.</p>
                     <p>There remaineth the third and laſt order he gives them; ſay to <hi>Archippus, Take heed to the Miniſtry thou haſt received in the LORD, that thou fulfill it.</hi> We learn from the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> that <hi>Archippus</hi> was a fellow-ſouldier of the Apoſtle's, that is, a Miniſter of the holy Goſpel. The meaning then is, that the Church do advertiſe him on St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s behalf, to mind both the quality of that excellent Miniſtry, and the Authority, and Divinity of the LORD, in whoſe name he had been called to it, that he might acquit himſelf worthily in it, and diligently fulfill all the functions of it, leaving no part of them unperformed. It is thought, that ſome negligence or other defect of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor might oblige the Apoſtle to cauſe this adviſe to be given him; But for my part, I would not, without a more preſſing reaſon, ſuſpect ſuch a thing of a perſon whom the Apoſtle had ſo much honoured, as to call him his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouldier, in the Epiſtle he wrote at the ſame time to <hi>Philemon:</hi> and ſhould rather beleeve, that <hi>Archippus</hi> having been newly receiv'd into this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred charge, the Apoſtle would encourage him by this advertiſement to a good diſcharge of his duty in it. However it were, you ſee, he gives the body of the Church a power to addreſs ſome remonſtrances ſometin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In fine he adds for a concluſion. The ſalutation by the own hand of me <hi>Paul.</hi> The reſt of the Epiſtle had been dictated by the Apoſtle, and written by another hand; He writeth theſe, and the following words himſelf, with his own hand;
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 3.17.</note> and it was his ordinary uſe ſo to do, as he declareth elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.2.</note> to aſſure his letters by this mark againſt the fraud of falſifiers, who even then impudently diſperſed forged letters under his name; as himſelf in another place intimates unto us. Yet before he ſhuts up, he conjures them, to remember his bonds; as an excellent ſeal of the truth of his Goſpel, and an irrefragable teſtimony of the affection he bore to them, and to the reſt of the Gentiles; for whoſe ſake he ſuffered theſe things; which conſequently obliged them to love him, and to pray the LORD ardently for him; and above all to imitate his conſtancy, and his patience on the like occaſions, if they ſhould be called to them. After this he gives them his bleſſing in theſe words, <hi>Grace be with you, Amen.</hi> He means the Grace of GOD in JESUS CHRIST
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50919:243"/>His Son our LORD: and it was not poſſible to crown this divine Letter with a fairer, and a fitter cloſe.</p>
                     <p>Bleſs we GOD, my Beloved Brethren, who hath vouchſafed us the grace, to read, and to explain it throughout, in theſe holy Aſſemblies; and pray Him that he would pleaſe to continue the ſame liberty and tranquility ſtill unto us; cauſing His word to fructifie among us. At preſent let us particularly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the remarkable Leſſons, which this concluſion doth contain, to the end we may ſedulouſly practiſe them, each of us according to our Vocation. Let Miniſters mind the advertiſement given to <hi>Archippus;</hi> and imitate the example of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> in loving cordially their flocks; in ſtriving for them both by prayer, and by word, and by deed; fulfilling their Miniſtry, and ſo demeaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it, as may be worthy both of the excellency of the charge, and of the reſpect and love they owe to the ſon of GOD, who hath honoured them with it.

Let the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Books of his fellow-brethen, the Prophets and Apoſtles of the LORD, reſound eternally in our Aſſemblies. Let their Voice alone be there heard, and their Doctrine alone receiv'd, and every tradition not marked with their zeal, be baniſh'd thence. Let heads of Families imitate the zeal of <hi>Nymphas,</hi> ſo conſcionably forming their children, and their people unto piety; and ſo regularly eſtabliſhing the exerciſes of it among them, that it may be truly ſaid of them, they each have a Church in their houſe. And all of us together, of what order or condition ſoever, let us ſtudy to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat in all the will of GOD; and perſevere unto the end in this holy profeſſion; remembring alſo the bonds of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the faithful, by which GOD hath confirmed the truth of His Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and ſo walk in the ſteps of theſe bleſſed ones, enjoying the favours of GOD with thankfulneſs, and undergoing his chaſtiſements and trials with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that His grace may be with us for ever, both in this world, and in the world to come. <hi>Amen.</hi>
